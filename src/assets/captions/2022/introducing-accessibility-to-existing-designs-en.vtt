JAY MCKAY: Introducing
Accessibility to Existing Designs,

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.420
presented by, Katie Gleason,
Web Designer at WP Engine.

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.482
KATIE GLEASON: Hello,
thank you for joining me.

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:49.290
My name is Katie Gleason,
and I'm going to be talking

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:52.170
to you all today about how
to introduce accessibility

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.680
to an existing design team,
how we did it at WP Engine,

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.667
and giving you some tips
on how you can do it

00:00:58.668 --> 00:01:00.550
with your own teams as well.

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.750
Like I said before,
my name is Katie.

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:08.880
I have short blonde hair.

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.386
I wear glasses; they
have green frames,

00:01:11.387 --> 00:01:13.390
but the frames are really thin.

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:14.800
You can't really see them.

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:19.500
I'm currently wearing a tan
short sleeve button-down shirt,

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.440
and I have a sleeve of tattoos on
my right hand which you might see

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.970
as I use my hands to talk a lot.

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:29.320
Let's get into it.

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.530
I'm a web designer with the
storefront marketing team

00:01:32.531 --> 00:01:33.600
at WP Engine.

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:42.420
I came into design by way of
psychology degree, and I've been

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.760
with WP Engine for
a couple years now.

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.238
At about this point last
year, actually,

00:01:49.239 --> 00:01:51.570
my team identified accessibility

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:58.250
as an internal priority
and took steps to head up

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:03.850
this accessibility initiative
within our storefront site design.

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:08.670
I led that project, so I'm
going to give you a little info

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.760
on what we did and, hopefully,
give you some tips on what you can do

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:13.760
as well.

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.310
The first thing we identified
when we were talking

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:27.790
about accessibility was that the
storefront marketing team already had

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.510
an existing design system
that was being used for ads,

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:41.330
was being used for the site,
and had approval that went way over

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.550
just our team.

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:50.390
So, while that design system wasn't
made with accessibility in mind,

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:53.980
we realized that we would
have much more luck trying

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:58.770
to find accessible solutions
within that system than trying

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:00.520
to change the system entirely.

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.460
That did add a layer
of difficulty though.

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:12.270
The second thing we identified, our
second hurdle was that our team and,

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:17.700
me, specifically, I really
lacked the knowledge to identify

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:23.980
and solve accessibility problems
and issues that existed on our site.

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:28.410
I had always had a passion
about accessibility,

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:32.913
but I had never had any
certifications any training,

00:03:34.197 --> 00:03:36.240
you know, I didn’t really
know where to start.

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:43.690
Then our third big hurdle was
that accessibility, itself,

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:47.560
is a lot more complicated
than this black-and-white view

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.850
of checking boxes off of a list.

00:03:52.320 --> 00:04:00.190
While there is a standard
of various qualifications,

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:03.150
sites and designs have
to meet to be accessible.

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.780
Accessibility is about
a lot more than that,

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:11.580
and I wanted our accessibility
initiative to be stronger

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:13.940
than just checking boxes.

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:19.290
The first hurdle that I
tackled was education,

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:24.740
and with the support of my
team, I was able

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:29.290
to find a comprehensive
introductory course called,

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:38.280
Introduction to Web Accessibility
with W3Cx, and really educate myself

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:43.060
on the why of accessibility,
as well as the what.

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:46.000
Who are we designing for?

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.380
Why is it important that we
make these things accessible?

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:56.420
For this initial accessibility
push, you do not have

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:59.690
to become an expert
in accessibility.

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:01.020
That's not going to
happen overnight.

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:05.610
It’s certainly not going to
happen in two, four, six weeks.

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:11.490
You know, this initial
education is the very beginning

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:15.310
of what I consider to be a
lifelong learning process.

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:18.870
I'm about a year in, and I'm still
learning new things every day.

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:23.080
I plan on learning new things
every day for the rest of the time

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:28.160
that I do accessible design
which, hopefully, is a long time.

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:36.670
I really benefited from learning
the why's of accessibility

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:41.190
through this course,
because it not only helped me

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:46.870
better explain solutions
and situations to my team,

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:51.370
but then also later on down the line
when I'm presenting designs outside

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:58.440
of the team,
it helps give a good reason

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:01.860
for accessibility besides just,
This is the right thing to do

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:03.250
or this is the right way to do it.

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:07.850
Neither of which are really strong
arguments in and of themselves.

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:16.610
Following my education, we did an
initial audit of our site which,

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:23.710
you know, the best way to do
accessibility testing with users is

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:30.580
to actually do testing with users
with disabilities, you know,

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:33.810
and get feedback on how
they view your site.

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:41.040
Since our accessibility initiative
was really an internal push,

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:42.690
that wasn't an option.

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:50.780
We didn't have the support of a
dedicated research team to be able

00:06:50.781 --> 00:06:59.521
to take the time and find the people
for this initial accessibility audit.

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:07.310
Right there, that was a hurdle
that we had to get past,

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:09.690
and we had to find
something that while it

00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:13.700
may not have been necessarily
an equivalent testing method,

00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:19.770
it was in the name of something
is better than nothing.

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:21.080
It was a start.

00:07:25.495 --> 00:07:34.609
For our first audit, we identified
our main buyer journey the homepage

00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:37.120
of our website and the
plans and pricing page.

00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:44.110
We wanted to break it into a
manageable chunk because trying

00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:49.720
to audit an entire website on your
first go round is really overwhelming

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:58.070
and to keep ourselves on track,
we wanted to be able to take it

00:07:58.070 --> 00:08:00.180
in bite sized manageable chunks.

00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:12.780
As the tester for this audit,
I ended up using a lot of tools

00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:21.260
to be able to try to accurately
capture various different experiences

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:22.260
of our site.

00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:28.640
Some of the tools I listed on here
some of the tools I used were Stark

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:36.180
for color contrast,
and also seeing what various types

00:08:36.180 --> 00:08:40.060
of color blindness might
look like on our site.

00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:45.730
Wave is really good for like a
macro view of the site as a whole

00:08:45.730 --> 00:08:49.960
and identifying potential
accessibility issues such as

00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:52.620
when images are missing alt text.

00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:58.560
Axe DevTools was something I
would use to turn off this CSS

00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:01.690
and the, you know,
the visuals on a site,

00:09:01.690 --> 00:09:06.650
so I could see that semantic
structure in place and determine,

00:09:06.650 --> 00:09:13.490
Does this logically makes sense?
You can obviously use the keyboard

00:09:13.490 --> 00:09:15.840
and tab through the
whole page make sure

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:19.030
that makes sense,
and then I use a Mac,

00:09:19.030 --> 00:09:21.570
and Apple has some good
accessibility settings

00:09:21.570 --> 00:09:30.760
where you can actually test various
different accessible experiences

00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:32.770
through their software.

00:09:32.770 --> 00:09:33.920
I use that as well.

00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:42.000
Following our audit, I compiled
a list of all of the issues

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.160
that I had identified in my
original audit, and we got together

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:51.770
as a team and there were some issues
that were fairly black-and-white

00:09:51.770 --> 00:09:52.930
like color contrast.

00:09:52.930 --> 00:09:54.890
There is not really like
a middle ground there.

00:09:54.890 --> 00:09:58.490
It either meets the minimum
requirement or it doesn't.

00:10:00.490 --> 00:10:07.330
Those were fairly straightforward to
fix since we could find other colors

00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:11.540
within our existing design
system that were accessible

00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:13.800
and met those color
contrast requirements.

00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:17.830
What we had to do though
is we had to identify

00:10:17.830 --> 00:10:19.760
these excess ability grey areas.

00:10:22.130 --> 00:10:28.380
Areas where there may not
necessarily be a one correct answer.

00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:35.250
For example, alt text on icons,
you can put alt text on icons but,

00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:38.410
also, if they are decorative,
you don't necessarily have to.

00:10:40.370 --> 00:10:44.160
We kind of had to go
into that thinking about

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:48.920
how can we provide an equivalent
experience for all of our users,

00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:51.810
not necessarily the
exact same experience.

00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:57.410
That's kind of where
the research comes in.

00:10:57.410 --> 00:11:00.920
Once we identified those grey
areas, I did a lot of research

00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:02.740
on potential solutions.

00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:08.670
I brought these solutions
to the team, and we agreed

00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:15.200
on our team’s design treatment for
these grey areas what we wanted

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:19.170
to do moving forward,
which I then documented

00:11:19.170 --> 00:11:25.060
in a Google slides
document along with visuals

00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:29.450
to help not only potential new
members on the team understand,

00:11:29.450 --> 00:11:33.860
but also people outside the
team who may not have been there

00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:35.786
from jump and may not
have seen everything

00:11:35.787 --> 00:11:37.040
that we were going through.

00:11:39.770 --> 00:11:43.670
The last thing that I feel like
is really important as far as,

00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:49.530
you know, creating your accessible
design framework is identifying

00:11:49.530 --> 00:11:57.330
a process to report new additions to
this framework and to this document.

00:11:57.330 --> 00:11:59.090
You know,
are going to have a Google form?

00:11:59.090 --> 00:12:02.700
Are you going to become the
point person that everybody comes

00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:05.460
to every time they have some
sort of accessibility question?

00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:10.700
If that's the case, how are you going
to record all of these questions

00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:13.820
so that you can get to
them in a timely manner

00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:16.240
without having to interrupt
your day every single time?

00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:21.920
These are all questions that
you have to ask yourself

00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:25.770
and things you have to decide
to help maintain this framework.

00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:31.760
Once you’ve built the
framework, and you have achieved

00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:35.240
the goals you set out to achieve,
you’ve redesigned some pages

00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:38.930
and you are feeling great about
yourself, you may be wondering,

00:12:38.930 --> 00:12:39.770
OK, what's next?

00:12:39.770 --> 00:12:41.750
How do I keep this moving?

00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:44.330
How do I maintain
this forward momentum?

00:12:46.530 --> 00:12:52.160
Like I mentioned just a few
moments ago, you're going

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:55.180
to want to continue
updating this framework.

00:12:55.180 --> 00:13:00.070
As you continue to go through just
your regular day-to-day design work,

00:13:00.070 --> 00:13:05.350
you will find other either
existing accessible grey areas

00:13:05.350 --> 00:13:09.140
or potentially, your team might
want to introduce a new component

00:13:09.140 --> 00:13:13.380
like an animation or video
onto a page and you're like,

00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:17.090
OK, how are we going to address
this accessibility wise?

00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:21.510
By maintaining that framework
and that documentation,

00:13:21.510 --> 00:13:26.570
you make it really easy for anybody
to use accessible design components

00:13:26.570 --> 00:13:30.730
and make sure things are done
correctly the first time.

00:13:33.460 --> 00:13:38.380
I've also found it really beneficial
to start introducing accessibility

00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:42.760
into the reasoning portion
of my design presentations.

00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:47.850
Like I mentioned when I was
talking about the education,

00:13:47.850 --> 00:13:51.750
the why behind accessibility
is super important, not just

00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:55.910
for your own benefit, but also for
the benefit for those around you.

00:13:55.910 --> 00:13:58.430
Why is accessible design
important to a business case?

00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:02.763
Who is accessible who is
this accessible design going

00:14:02.764 --> 00:14:03.710
to be helping?

00:14:04.930 --> 00:14:09.130
Really says a lot more than
just, We did it this way

00:14:09.130 --> 00:14:11.160
because it's accessible.

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:13.760
You know, people would to
understand and people want

00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:16.850
to grow their own knowledge,
and if you can really kind

00:14:16.850 --> 00:14:19.730
of help evangelize accessibility
within your organization,

00:14:19.730 --> 00:14:25.240
you would be shocked at how many
people you can get on board.

00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:32.390
The last one, my last piece of advice
would be to pick the right times

00:14:32.390 --> 00:14:35.810
to really dig your heels
in as far as accessibility.

00:14:38.050 --> 00:14:42.900
You know, similar to a lot of
feedback you get on designs,

00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:47.850
sometimes the accessible option
isn't going to be the one

00:14:47.850 --> 00:14:49.280
that everybody likes the most.

00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:53.870
In those situations,
you have options.

00:14:53.870 --> 00:14:58.010
You can research potential
other accessible designs,

00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:05.830
you can dig your heels in and
say, No, this is the best way

00:15:05.830 --> 00:15:10.500
to do it, and I'm going to
stand by that or you can say,

00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:15.850
You know what, OK,
we can have tooltips on this page,

00:15:15.850 --> 00:15:21.720
but I am going to find a better way
to present the information you want

00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:24.020
to present in an accessible way.

00:15:25.630 --> 00:15:30.630
Whether you are making a stand
right then and there or going back

00:15:30.630 --> 00:15:34.180
to your own personal drawing
board, you kind of have

00:15:34.180 --> 00:15:38.420
to make those decisions
on the fly and on your own

00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:40.320
with the support of your
team, obviously.

00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:48.920
So, just in closing, accessibility
for me is a never-ending journey

00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:50.130
of education and growth.

00:15:51.420 --> 00:15:58.570
I found a lot of joy and a lot
of fulfillment in the beginning

00:15:58.570 --> 00:16:02.740
of my accessibility journey,
and something that I would recommend

00:16:02.740 --> 00:16:07.890
for everybody is to find a
community of people like all of you

00:16:07.890 --> 00:16:10.640
who are passionate
about accessibility.

00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:16.230
Whether that's an accessible
design group within your company

00:16:16.230 --> 00:16:22.190
or just a group passionate about
accessibility anywhere like Facebook,

00:16:22.190 --> 00:16:23.060
LinkedIn.

00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:25.190
It doesn't really matter.

00:16:25.190 --> 00:16:30.010
Find a group of people who are also
trying to further their education

00:16:30.010 --> 00:16:33.510
and knowledge and growth and
y'all can help each other

00:16:33.510 --> 00:16:39.050
and grow together and I really find
that that's incredibly beneficial.

00:16:40.460 --> 00:16:44.330
Thank you so much for your time
today, and if you have any questions,

00:16:44.330 --> 00:16:47.920
I am in the chat and should
be able to answer those.

00:16:49.350 --> 00:16:53.410
Feel free to find me on
LinkedIn, and we can chat more.

00:16:53.410 --> 00:16:54.410
Thanks, guys.
