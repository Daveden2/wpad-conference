WEBVTT

00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:30.454
[pause ]

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:31.770
<v Abbas> Hi, welcome everybody.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.670
I hope everybody's having
a great time so far.

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.820
Thank you for joining us.

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.370
Welcome to WordPress
Accessibility Day.

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:42.480
My name is Abbas Jaffary.

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.160
I'm a mathematics
teacher and tutor focused

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:49.290
on making mathematics more
accessible on the web and beyond.

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:52.960
I want to thank everybody for
joining us for Form Accessibility

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.450
and Beyond.

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:58.070
With our speakers today,
we have Rian Rietveld.

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:03.480
She is a web accessibility specialist
at Level Level in the Netherlands.

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.460
She works in Rotterdam for
the digital agency Level Level

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.730
as an accessibility
consultant and is a trainer

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:14.320
for the online learning
platform, the LI Collective.

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.610
She is part of web projects
from start to finish,

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.960
training both the Level
Level team and their clients

00:01:20.961 --> 00:01:22.350
in web accessibility.

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.610
Besides that, she does accessibility
consultancy and training

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.590
for major web agencies
and companies.

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.850
She loves to share her
knowledge at word camps

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:33.330
and accessibility
conferences worldwide.

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:37.000
When not coding, reviewing, or
teaching, you can find Rian working

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.000
in her garden.

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:41.180
We welcome Rian.

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:47.520
We also have Morgan Kay,
a software engineer at Rocketgenius,

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.610
where she works on a product
team to build Gravity Forms.

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.260
She has over 15 years of
experience with WordPress,

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.500
both as a developer and
community organizer.

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.320
She has organized word
camps and WordPress meetups

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.150
and facilitated trainings
and safe spaces for women

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:06.950
and underrepresented
groups in technology.

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.078
When she's not working
at her computer,

00:02:09.079 --> 00:02:12.215
Morgan is usually out hiking in
the beautiful Pacific Northwest

00:02:12.216 --> 00:02:13.260
or reading.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:15.360
Welcome both of you.

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.360
Thank you.

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.860
Everybody, please feel free to
add your questions in the Q&A tab

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.870
in Slido, and we'll answer
them at the end of the session.

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:29.360
Please use the ideas section
to chat with other attendees.

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.084
Now I'll turn it over to Rian.

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:35.344
<v Rian> Hi.

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.590
welcome.

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.530
Thank you everybody for joining us.

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.846
Morgan?

00:02:43.846 --> 00:02:44.898
<v Morgan> Yes.

00:02:47.083 --> 00:02:52.830
I'm Morgan, and today we are going to
talk about forms and accessibility.

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:58.410
Forms are the most common
interactive elements on websites

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:02.840
and the most basic way for users
to share information with you.

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.000
Form accessibility and
usability are absolutely vital.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.220
If users can't fill out your form,
they can't interact with you,

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.860
they can't place orders,
they can't contact you.

00:03:14.595 --> 00:03:17.650
<v Rian> We are not going
to talk only about code,

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:22.940
but also about form design,
and how to think about forms

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.480
from the viewpoint of your users.

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.950
There's so much to tell,
and we have only 40 minutes,

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.300
so we only address the
most important takeaways.

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:39.318
We have demo code and
all the resources online

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:41.090
on the GitHub page for you.

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:54.000
The shortcut for that page
is gravityfor.ms/3U9Sy4T.

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:56.287
Morgan?

00:03:59.028 --> 00:04:01.920
<v Morgan> When you put
a form on your website,

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:05.250
the very first thing you need
to do is to ask yourself,

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:06.800
why are you building a form?

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:10.970
How can you build the form
to meet not only your needs

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:12.900
but also your users' needs?

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:17.530
So often,
accessibility is an afterthought.

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:20.400
We build a website, and then we
test it with keyboard navigation

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.490
and a screen reader and we
fix the problems we have

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:24.890
and we call it a day.

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:27.660
You should really start
thinking about accessibility

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:32.470
before you even create a form
because they are so important.

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:34.920
You want to build the
form, not just the code,

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:38.280
but also the form questions
in the form visual design

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.120
with your users' needs in
mind from the very beginning.

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:47.230
In addition to accessibility, you
also want to think about usability,

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:50.207
and not just for users
with disabilities,

00:04:50.208 --> 00:04:52.120
but for all of your users.

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:55.350
Accessibility and usability are
very closely linked together,

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:59.630
and it's not just about assistive
tools like keyboard navigation

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:00.990
and screen in meters.

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:05.900
You want all of your users to easily
understand and fill out your forms.

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.793
If you ask yourself
from the beginning,

00:05:09.794 --> 00:05:11.580
why you're building a form,

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:14.750
this is going to impact
how you build the form.

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:18.970
For example, you're going to want to
build an e-commerce form differently

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:20.920
from the job application.

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:25.020
On an e-commerce form, you want it to
be as short and as easy as possible.

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:28.540
You don't want users to have time
to second guess their purchases,

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:32.450
you want them to give you your
money, and submit the form.

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:37.220
If your form is a job
application, users are willing

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:39.440
to put some more work
into a job application,

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:43.280
so it can be a more complex
form, but you still don't want

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:46.380
to make it too difficult for them.

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:49.440
Different forms have different
usability requirements, and you want

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:51.020
to think about that
from the beginning.

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:56.720
You need to think about what
information you actually need

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:58.120
from your users.

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:01.420
Do you really need all
of those form fields?

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:03.660
Once you start asking
questions, it's really tempting

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:06.320
to keep asking more,
but you want to make sure

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:09.640
that you're really only asking
users for the information

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:11.220
you actually need.

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:13.067
For instance, on contact forms,

00:06:13.068 --> 00:06:15.510
contact forms often
have phone numbers.

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:20.330
Do you really need that phone
number on the contact form,

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:23.120
or demographic information?

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:26.490
We often want to know as much
as we can about our users' age,

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:28.920
experience level,
how they found us.

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:31.530
A lot of that information
isn't strictly necessary,

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:34.010
and it just makes the
form longer for the user.

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:38.020
On the other hand, maybe you do need
that information, and that's fine.

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:41.110
Ask for it if you need it,
but just be aware that users

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:46.000
might be hesitant to share even
personal information like gender

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.440
or marital status, or race.

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:52.020
Only ask for that
information if you need it.

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:54.533
If you do need that
kind of information,

00:06:54.534 --> 00:06:58.815
make it clear to your users why
you are requesting the information

00:06:58.816 --> 00:07:00.920
and how you're going to use it.

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:04.380
For example, if you are asking
for demographic information,

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:09.870
such as race or gender, make it
clear why you need that information

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:11.210
and how you're going to use it.

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:16.850
Another example is a
phone number field.

00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:19.140
If you are asking
for a phone number,

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:23.050
you should probably clarify
whether you plan to use that number

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:26.410
for phone calls or for
text, because some users

00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:28.550
might actually give you a
different phone number depending on

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:30.690
how you're going to use it.

00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:34.760
The more information you
give your users about

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:37.780
why you're asking these questions,
the more likely they are

00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:39.660
to be willing to
answer those questions.

00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:44.910
You also want to think about
the easiest way for users

00:07:44.910 --> 00:07:48.250
to give you the information
you need and what kind of

00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:51.680
form inputs are easiest
for them to use.

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:58.130
For instance, if you are asking for
categories, you might have a list

00:07:58.130 --> 00:08:02.080
of 100 categories, and you
should think about, is it easier

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:04.850
for your users to read
through that big long list

00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:07.890
and pick out the correct ones,
or would it be easier for them

00:08:07.890 --> 00:08:10.810
to just type in
their own categories?

00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:14.150
If they're typing in their own
categories, the data you get

00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:17.810
might not be as clean,
but you'll actually get better data

00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:21.200
because it's going to
be easier for your users

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:23.620
to fill out the
correct information.

00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:25.870
On the other hand,
if it is really important

00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:31.880
that users give exactly the
categories that you have in mind,

00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:34.860
then a drop-down probably
is the better choice.

00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:38.450
You just need to think through,
is it easier for your users

00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:41.040
to read through a long list or
to type in their own answer.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.080
Once you've thought
about these questions,

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:47.860
what information do you
need from your users,

00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:51.400
and what's the easiest way for
them to give you that information?

00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:53.580
Now you're ready to
start building your form.

00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:56.620
I'll turn it over to Rian to
talk some more about usability.

00:08:56.620 --> 00:09:01.460
<v Rian> Form usability
or user experience.

00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:06.150
How to help your user fill out
a form as easy as possible.

00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:08.480
The last thing you
want, that users leave

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:12.010
because a form is too
complicated or not trustworthy.

00:09:14.450 --> 00:09:16.980
Very important is
to be predictable.

00:09:18.830 --> 00:09:22.620
For example, make sure the
user has everything they need

00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:26.540
at hand before they start
filling out the form.

00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:30.760
For example, a credit card
number, passport, an order number,

00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:33.760
or other documents or
information they might need.

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:38.520
Do you have a timer on your form?

00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:41.370
For example, for security reasons?

00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:45.300
Don't cause a panic, "Oh,
my I don't have that time.

00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:46.300
I cannot do this."

00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:48.610
Tick-tock, tick-tock,
the user panics.

00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:55.110
Inform them in advance there
will be a timer and tell them

00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:57.290
why there is a timer.

00:09:57.290 --> 00:10:02.120
Inform them about the time
they have and give them a way

00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:05.520
to extend that time,
not everybody is that quick.

00:10:09.090 --> 00:10:13.030
As Morgan already told, only
ask what you really, really need

00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:17.460
to know, but even then
that can be quite a lot.

00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:19.750
Do you have long form?

00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:27.550
Break it up in steps, each step a
topic, tell how many steps there are.

00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:33.970
Name each step and tell
what will happen next.

00:10:33.970 --> 00:10:36.990
Let users know how much
they still need to fill out.

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:43.350
For everybody, especially people
with anxiety, this is helpful

00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:44.350
and reassuring.

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:50.090
At the bottom of each step,
provide clear navigation,

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:56.890
not just back and next
but back to step two.

00:10:56.890 --> 00:11:02.380
The next step, step four is
student information, for example.

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:07.060
Then people are reassured
they are doing the right thing

00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:11.820
and they also can go back and
check what has been filled out,

00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:13.350
so be predictable.

00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:20.500
Don't put the burden of
your problem on the user

00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:21.750
and that's what happens a lot.

00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:27.040
We all hate spam
informs, don't you?

00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:31.810
Maybe accept the people who sent
you spam, so what do you do?

00:11:31.810 --> 00:11:35.850
You put the burden of
preventing spam on your user.

00:11:35.850 --> 00:11:39.230
"Hey, you, prove you're a
human with good intentions."

00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:42.070
For example, you add a CAPTCHA.

00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:47.810
This is an example I saw in
the world is actually a CAPTCHA

00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:54.870
from Google version 2, please click
each image containing a smiling dog,

00:11:56.180 --> 00:11:57.180
really.

00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:02.260
I'm a cat person, smiling dog
is really a problem for me

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:07.390
and what about people with autism
who have difficulties reading emotion

00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:08.390
from a face?

00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:13.830
I also must be able to
recognize you as school buses.

00:12:13.830 --> 00:12:14.350
Really?

00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:17.390
I'm from Europe, what do I know
about you as a school buses?

00:12:19.010 --> 00:12:22.280
Google CAPTCHA version
3 is user-friendly

00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:25.350
but maybe has some privacy issues.

00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:31.290
A rising star is a turnstile who
claims to be a user-friendly,

00:12:31.290 --> 00:12:34.750
privacy-preserving,
alternative to CAPTCHA.

00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:40.260
I haven't researched it but which
option you choose, do your research

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:45.020
and take accessibility, GDPR,
and usability into account.

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:53.270
Then the later debate about, should
I use multi-select versus a checkbox

00:12:53.270 --> 00:12:54.510
or an autocomplete.

00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:56.500
What is better?

00:12:57.177 --> 00:12:58.950
A multi-select or checkboxes?

00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:02.557
What about the search
box autocomplete

00:13:02.558 --> 00:13:04.450
if you want to select something?

00:13:05.870 --> 00:13:07.750
Think from your
user's point of view.

00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:12.020
When you want your user,
your visitor to select options,

00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:14.260
make life easy for them.

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:20.470
Multi-select interfaces are
hard, checkboxes are super easy.

00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:23.902
If you have many
options, a searchable,

00:13:23.903 --> 00:13:26.390
accessible select is useful.

00:13:26.390 --> 00:13:27.390
Let me show you.

00:13:30.990 --> 00:13:34.040
This is part of the GitHub
pages we created for you

00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:41.100
with all the demo code and also
an example of a multi-select,

00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:45.210
checkboxes,
a select with many options.

00:13:45.210 --> 00:13:50.520
I want to show you accessible
alternative for a select

00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:52.290
with the search.

00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:56.640
On auto select,
if you have a multi-select,

00:13:56.640 --> 00:14:01.210
if you use a mouse you
can select an option

00:14:01.210 --> 00:14:07.020
and if you want to select the
bird, you have to select comment

00:14:08.070 --> 00:14:12.180
but if you want to remove it--
Oh, if I click,

00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:16.080
it's gone again so if I do
shift, I select everything

00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:21.050
and with command I-- this is
really a very difficult interface,

00:14:21.050 --> 00:14:24.490
with a mouse let alone with
a keyboard or screen reader.

00:14:25.850 --> 00:14:28.890
This is the same with checkboxes.

00:14:28.890 --> 00:14:33.800
Click, click,
ready and it stays there.

00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:38.590
It's really, really easy and people
get that so don't use multi-select

00:14:38.590 --> 00:14:41.000
because it's a very
difficult interface.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:42.140
JOE: Hey, Rian.

00:14:42.982 --> 00:14:43.922
<v Rian> If you have country--

00:14:43.923 --> 00:14:45.170
JOE: [inaudible]

00:14:45.170 --> 00:14:45.400
Rian.

00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:45.980
<v Rian> Yes.

00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:48.070
JOE: Is it possible
for you to zoom in

00:14:48.070 --> 00:14:51.300
so that we can see the
forms a bit better?

00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:52.290
<v Rian> Is it better?

00:14:52.290 --> 00:14:53.170
JOE: That's great.

00:14:53.170 --> 00:14:54.820
Thank you very much.

00:14:54.820 --> 00:15:00.190
<v Rian> Okay, if you have a
country and we want to select

00:15:00.190 --> 00:15:04.360
with more than 200 options,
more than already set, yes,

00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:10.090
is it the best way that you can
use a searchable auto select,

00:15:11.530 --> 00:15:13.920
but most of them are inaccessible?

00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:18.040
If you use select to or chosen,
the screen reader feedback

00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:23.940
is non-existent sometimes with some
patterns, the keyboard doesn't work.

00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:31.154
The US Government published
on alphagov.github.io,

00:15:31.155 --> 00:15:33.640
accessible components.

00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:34.980
These are accessible.

00:15:36.130 --> 00:15:41.100
If you want to search for the
Netherlands, it gives you two results

00:15:42.570 --> 00:15:46.280
and with the screen reader,
it denounces two results.

00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:50.790
With the arrow down, you can
actually select one with enter.

00:15:52.390 --> 00:16:00.090
This is an accessible alternative
for auto-select, for example,

00:16:00.090 --> 00:16:02.170
for the components that
are not accessible.

00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:06.650
Think about this, think from
the user what's the best option?

00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:11.270
Right, oh, this is the demo, okay.

00:16:12.672 --> 00:16:15.357
Then we're going to
form design with Morgan.

00:16:16.017 --> 00:16:19.600
<v Morgan> Yes,
you want your form to be usable

00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:22.440
but you also want it to look nice.

00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:25.590
Browsers or window form elements
are a little bit differently

00:16:25.590 --> 00:16:29.360
and honestly, out of the
box, a lot of them are ugly.

00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:32.350
It's natural to want to change
the appearance of your forms

00:16:32.350 --> 00:16:35.590
to make them more
consistent across browsers,

00:16:35.590 --> 00:16:38.330
to make them more pleasing to the
eye, and to make them look better

00:16:38.330 --> 00:16:39.680
with the rest of your website.

00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:44.990
You need to be careful when
you restyle form elements

00:16:44.990 --> 00:16:48.240
and make sure you don't
change the design so much

00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:50.930
that users can't recognize them.

00:16:50.930 --> 00:16:54.150
You want to make sure
that your designed

00:16:54.150 --> 00:16:57.980
form inputs still feel familiar
and intuitive so users know

00:16:57.980 --> 00:16:59.800
how to interact with them.

00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:03.410
For example, this is a demo
I found on CodePen that shows

00:17:03.410 --> 00:17:07.090
how to style radio
buttons and checkboxes.

00:17:07.090 --> 00:17:11.260
You can see that for both
radio buttons and checkboxes,

00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:14.110
they're using both
squares and circles.

00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:19.390
Then they have these other
shapes like this rounded square

00:17:19.390 --> 00:17:25.360
and this diamond and it's not
obvious from looking at these

00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:28.130
whether you are allowed
to select one or many.

00:17:29.190 --> 00:17:31.830
Users are used to knowing
that when there's a circle,

00:17:31.830 --> 00:17:35.190
you can select one and when there's
a square, you can select many.

00:17:35.190 --> 00:17:38.550
If you use other shapes,
it can get really confusing

00:17:38.550 --> 00:17:42.260
or if you reverse the functionality,
that is also confusing.

00:17:43.810 --> 00:17:48.190
Make sure that the form inputs
are still intuitive and behave

00:17:48.190 --> 00:17:49.680
in a recognizable way.

00:17:52.330 --> 00:17:53.940
You also want to make
sure that changing

00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:57.440
the style doesn't change the
behavior of the form element

00:17:57.440 --> 00:17:59.390
or break the functionality.

00:17:59.390 --> 00:18:04.340
Your styled form elements should
work the same way as unstyled

00:18:04.340 --> 00:18:07.770
form elements so that users
who can't see, who don't know

00:18:07.770 --> 00:18:12.270
that this looks different can
still interact with the form.

00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:18.598
For example, focus states,
it's really easy to forget

00:18:18.599 --> 00:18:20.560
about focus states.

00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:25.350
Designers often think they're
ugly, developers just forget

00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:27.580
that it's something
we need to deal with.

00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:31.110
Always test with the keyboard
and make sure that you have focus

00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:32.230
and active states.

00:18:33.620 --> 00:18:38.620
Here's an example of some code
that I found on w3schools.com,

00:18:38.620 --> 00:18:43.120
which is notorious for having a
lot of really bad code examples.

00:18:45.570 --> 00:18:49.330
If you're looking for code
examples, look at our resources

00:18:49.330 --> 00:18:53.050
because we've given you some
good functional examples.

00:18:53.050 --> 00:18:56.950
In this particular example,
they have restyled the checkbox,

00:18:56.950 --> 00:19:02.230
and the way they've done
it, they're basically hiding

00:19:02.230 --> 00:19:05.580
the existing checkbox and
replacing it with another one

00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:08.730
and there's no focus state.

00:19:08.730 --> 00:19:13.450
You can't tell in this little
video, but I am using a keyboard

00:19:13.450 --> 00:19:18.580
to interact with this form
and there's no indication

00:19:18.580 --> 00:19:22.200
of which checkbox is
active at the moment.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.090
Actually, I messed with
the code on this to try

00:19:27.090 --> 00:19:29.640
to add a focus state to it, and
the way they've written that code,

00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:33.200
it is impossible to
add a focus state.

00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:37.890
Just be careful not to break the
functionality when you add styles.

00:19:40.030 --> 00:19:42.210
You also want to be
careful with dropdowns.

00:19:43.390 --> 00:19:48.850
It's really easy to style the
input, that initial box at the top

00:19:48.850 --> 00:19:51.990
of this demo, that styling the
drop-down menu that shows up

00:19:51.990 --> 00:19:55.990
when you click on it
is very difficult.

00:19:55.990 --> 00:20:01.450
It usually requires JavaScript and
it is usually not keyboard navigable.

00:20:02.690 --> 00:20:06.600
That dropdown might be really
ugly, but you're really better off

00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:10.760
leaving it alone and leaving it ugly
so that users can still interact

00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:11.644
with it.

00:20:13.490 --> 00:20:16.510
There is some browser default
behavior that you can change

00:20:16.510 --> 00:20:20.280
without hurting accessibility,
for example, fieldsets.

00:20:21.310 --> 00:20:25.950
Fieldsets look really ugly in
the browser but Rian will explain

00:20:25.950 --> 00:20:28.190
in a few minutes why
they're really important.

00:20:30.550 --> 00:20:33.510
This is what a form looks
like with field sets.

00:20:33.510 --> 00:20:36.890
With some pretty minimal
CSS, you can make field sets

00:20:36.890 --> 00:20:39.090
look like other inputs.

00:20:39.090 --> 00:20:41.490
It doesn't take much
to remove that border

00:20:41.490 --> 00:20:45.780
and scoot the legend
around a little bit.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:50.050
If you have a form that has a mix
of field sets and regular fields,

00:20:50.050 --> 00:20:53.510
those fieldsets look extra weird.

00:20:53.510 --> 00:20:56.250
You can adjust the
behavior of field sets

00:20:56.250 --> 00:20:59.220
to make them look more
like the rest of the form.

00:21:01.850 --> 00:21:04.690
You should also make sure you
put the submit button at the end

00:21:04.690 --> 00:21:05.850
of the form.

00:21:05.850 --> 00:21:10.300
I know that sounds obvious but
this has become very common lately.

00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:16.880
Especially with like terms
and conditions or SMS consent.

00:21:17.910 --> 00:21:21.330
Users and especially
blind users will not see

00:21:21.330 --> 00:21:24.530
or read anything that happens
below the submit button

00:21:24.530 --> 00:21:27.680
because they think the submit
button is the end of the form.

00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:30.790
Don't put other information
under the button.

00:21:30.790 --> 00:21:33.350
This is a screenshot from Etsy.

00:21:33.350 --> 00:21:36.330
They've got that register
button and then underneath it,

00:21:36.330 --> 00:21:39.450
they have other options for
other ways you can sign in.

00:21:39.450 --> 00:21:45.090
Then below that,
they have some legalese saying that

00:21:45.090 --> 00:21:48.710
by registering you are agreeing
to their terms and conditions.

00:21:48.710 --> 00:21:53.300
A lot of users are
never going to see that.

00:21:53.300 --> 00:21:56.300
Make sure the submit button is always
the very last thing in the form.

00:21:59.300 --> 00:22:01.330
Don't hide labels.

00:22:01.330 --> 00:22:07.280
Labels need to always be visible and
placeholders do not replace labels.

00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:10.610
The placeholder goes away
as soon as you start typing.

00:22:10.610 --> 00:22:12.770
Now you don't know
what you're doing.

00:22:14.190 --> 00:22:16.900
Make sure that the
label is always visible.

00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:22.220
Error messages are
also very important.

00:22:22.220 --> 00:22:26.350
It's easy to forget that you
need to design error messages

00:22:26.350 --> 00:22:29.010
but you want to create some
space at the top of your form,

00:22:29.010 --> 00:22:32.400
so that you can display all of
the error messages in one place.

00:22:34.450 --> 00:22:37.910
You can use color to show
that there is an error.

00:22:37.910 --> 00:22:41.520
For instance, in this screenshot,
the error message is in red,

00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:45.650
but also use an icon or some
other indicator that doesn't rely

00:22:45.650 --> 00:22:49.440
on color so that people who can't
see color will still be able

00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:50.730
to tell that there's
something wrong.

00:22:52.540 --> 00:22:55.600
You want to make sure that the
text of the error message is clear

00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:57.290
and tells the users
what they need to do.

00:22:59.020 --> 00:23:01.310
Rian is going to talk some
more about error messages

00:23:01.310 --> 00:23:02.940
along with some other standards.

00:23:05.284 --> 00:23:09.520
<v Rian> Next topic is Web Content
Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)

00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:10.520
on forms.

00:23:11.770 --> 00:23:15.430
There are quite a few guidelines
or success criteria about forms.

00:23:16.460 --> 00:23:19.840
I want to address the
most important ones.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:27.200
For accessibility, we want
to comply to WCAG version 2.1

00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:32.200
that's at the moment, the latest
version, and we globally stick

00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:36.710
to the level AA, so WCAG 2.1 AA.

00:23:36.710 --> 00:23:41.230
That's what we are going
to address and we give you

00:23:41.230 --> 00:23:43.660
the most important topics first.

00:23:46.660 --> 00:23:47.660
Color contrast.

00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:50.090
Color contrast in forms.

00:23:51.190 --> 00:23:55.930
Well you can call easy
calculate color contrast.

00:23:55.930 --> 00:23:58.874
If you google color
contrast analyzer,

00:23:58.875 --> 00:24:01.290
you get like a zillion results.

00:24:01.290 --> 00:24:03.020
Pick the one you really prefer.

00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:10.040
For text-like labels,
the color contrast must be 4.5

00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:15.070
to 1 against the background, but
that also counts for the placeholder.

00:24:17.460 --> 00:24:23.200
Pro-tip, add to the placeholder,
CSS in opacity of one

00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:27.990
because some browsers add by
default opacity to the placeholder.

00:24:29.020 --> 00:24:32.390
It is lighter than you
defined in the CSS.

00:24:32.390 --> 00:24:36.740
Add an opacity of !.

00:24:36.740 --> 00:24:41.290
There's also a color contrast
rule for borders and icons.

00:24:41.290 --> 00:24:45.400
If you have a form control
and you have a border,

00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:48.510
the color contrast must be 3 to 1.

00:24:49.670 --> 00:24:52.490
It also counts for
icons that have meaning.

00:24:53.630 --> 00:24:56.550
That is that people
don't need to guess like

00:24:56.550 --> 00:25:01.450
where do I put a mouse to
actually click on an input field,

00:25:01.450 --> 00:25:06.890
clear board is to find that.

00:25:06.890 --> 00:25:10.330
Then connect the label to an input.

00:25:10.330 --> 00:25:14.130
Maybe you say, "Oh,
I know that," but I can name you

00:25:14.130 --> 00:25:17.920
like a zillion developers that
hear this for the first time.

00:25:19.570 --> 00:25:23.320
If you have a label and an input,
you have to connect them together.

00:25:25.220 --> 00:25:30.710
The input you give an ID and
the label, you give an attribute

00:25:30.710 --> 00:25:32.830
for referring to that Id.

00:25:34.930 --> 00:25:37.320
I will run a demo and Voiceover.

00:25:38.540 --> 00:25:44.730
Then you hear first, no label
attached and then a label attached,

00:25:44.730 --> 00:25:47.480
and then a label
with a placeholder.

00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:48.640
Let's see if that works.

00:25:50.649 --> 00:25:53.260
SPEAKER: Adding level 1,
connect a label to a form control.

00:25:56.180 --> 00:26:01.170
Enter text blank name,
what's your favorite color?

00:26:01.170 --> 00:26:02.170
Edit text.

00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:06.230
What's your favorite color,
type the color, edit text.

00:26:07.933 --> 00:26:10.530
<v Rian> First it's
a no label attached.

00:26:10.530 --> 00:26:14.380
The screen reader says
just edit text blank.

00:26:14.380 --> 00:26:16.860
I have no idea what the label is.

00:26:16.860 --> 00:26:20.830
If there's a proper label
input relation, then it says,

00:26:20.830 --> 00:26:23.310
what's your favorite
color, edit text.

00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:28.100
If there is a placeholder,
it first announces the label

00:26:28.100 --> 00:26:29.500
and then the placeholder.

00:26:31.299 --> 00:26:39.689
Always connect a label to an input
field and then group elements

00:26:39.690 --> 00:26:41.750
that belong together in a fieldset.

00:26:43.750 --> 00:26:47.250
For example, this is a code
example, how many cookies

00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:56.570
and there is an option select with an
option and you can select a number.

00:26:58.130 --> 00:27:02.120
If you have a field set,
how many cookies is announced

00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:03.670
with each selection?

00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:09.900
They have like a
connection with each other.

00:27:11.030 --> 00:27:15.980
I will show you a screen
reader demo on how that works.

00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:23.200
First with select, then with radios,
buttons, then with checkboxes.

00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:25.610
The last one with
the shipping address.

00:27:25.610 --> 00:27:29.970
All these elements belong
together in a field set.

00:27:29.970 --> 00:27:31.600
These are four different fieldsets.

00:27:33.318 --> 00:27:35.840
SPEAKER: Heading level
1, field sets.

00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:37.590
One, Amount, pop-up button.

00:27:37.590 --> 00:27:39.030
How many cookies?

00:27:39.030 --> 00:27:40.580
Menu, three items.

00:27:40.580 --> 00:27:41.580
Tick, one.

00:27:43.010 --> 00:27:44.010
Two.

00:27:45.100 --> 00:27:46.560
Closing menu.

00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:48.230
Two, amount, pop-up button.

00:27:50.290 --> 00:27:51.570
small, radio button.

00:27:51.570 --> 00:27:55.510

00:28:07.290 --> 00:28:08.670
Dog, unticked, tick box.

00:28:08.670 --> 00:28:09.660
Which pets do you have?

00:28:09.660 --> 00:28:10.620
Which pets do you have?

00:28:10.620 --> 00:28:13.710
Group, Cat, unticked tick box.

00:28:13.710 --> 00:28:15.270
Which pets do you have?

00:28:15.270 --> 00:28:17.000
Ticked cat tick box?

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:19.780
Bird, unticked tickbox,
Which pets do you have?

00:28:19.780 --> 00:28:22.660
Mouse, unticked tickbox,
Which pets do you have?

00:28:22.660 --> 00:28:25.950
Street, edit text, Shipping
address, Shipping address, Group,

00:28:25.950 --> 00:28:29.610
postal code, edit text,
Shipping address, City, edit text,

00:28:29.610 --> 00:28:30.550
Shipping address.

00:28:32.377 --> 00:28:37.040
<v Rian> The relation of the
ship, the legend is announced

00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:38.040
with each field.

00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:41.100
When you can see,
you can see clearly okay,

00:28:41.100 --> 00:28:44.850
how many cookies this all belongs
together or a shipping address,

00:28:44.850 --> 00:28:48.130
but if you are blind, you can
get it announced with each field

00:28:48.130 --> 00:28:51.160
to make sure you fill
out the fields right.

00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:52.160
All right.

00:28:54.317 --> 00:28:55.030
Next one.

00:28:56.070 --> 00:29:03.090
Then use aria-describedby to connect
more information to the input field.

00:29:03.090 --> 00:29:05.880
We have a label connected
to an input field,

00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:09.930
but also extra information
connected to the input field.

00:29:09.930 --> 00:29:11.590
They are announced all together.

00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:17.750
The label is referring to
the id of the input field.

00:29:17.750 --> 00:29:20.880
Aria-describedby is different
that has an id of its own.

00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:25.710
The paragraph you want to describe
has an ID and with the input,

00:29:25.710 --> 00:29:29.430
you say aria-describedby
referring to that Id.

00:29:29.430 --> 00:29:36.550
This is all in example code,
so you can look it up later.

00:29:36.550 --> 00:29:38.620
I will show you how this works.

00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:40.950
This is a short demo.

00:29:40.950 --> 00:29:43.060
SPEAKER: Heading level
one, Aria-describedby.

00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:49.350
Your new password, secured edit
text, main, Please use a password

00:29:49.350 --> 00:29:50.640
of minimal 8 characters.

00:29:51.730 --> 00:29:53.340
I agree with the
terms and conditions.

00:29:53.340 --> 00:29:57.100
Inticked, tick box, Consent,
Consent, Group, ticked, I agree

00:29:57.100 --> 00:29:59.710
with the terms and
conditions, tick box.

00:29:59.710 --> 00:30:01.350
Please read our
terms and conditions.

00:30:02.910 --> 00:30:06.960
<v Rian> Everything is read
out if the input fields

00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:08.890
or the form control gets focused.

00:30:13.020 --> 00:30:15.970
Last topic, form validation.

00:30:15.970 --> 00:30:17.370
That's super important.

00:30:18.870 --> 00:30:22.390
If people cannot fill out your
form right or don't understand

00:30:22.390 --> 00:30:23.800
what goes wrong, they will leave.

00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:29.450
First, tell the rules in advance.

00:30:30.470 --> 00:30:32.870
How many times did you
scream at the screen?

00:30:32.870 --> 00:30:36.330
Tell me the rules of
the password beforehand.

00:30:36.330 --> 00:30:37.810
That's so super annoying.

00:30:37.810 --> 00:30:42.600
You come up with a super password
and you press enter or submit

00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:47.220
and then, "Oh, no, but it has
to be like-- Tell the people

00:30:47.220 --> 00:30:50.330
in advance what the
rules of the password is.

00:30:53.190 --> 00:30:56.870
As Morgan already told,
not by color alone.

00:30:56.870 --> 00:31:01.220
Don't put only a red border
around the required field

00:31:01.220 --> 00:31:03.800
that isn't filled out.

00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:06.550
What should you do?

00:31:06.550 --> 00:31:09.540
The default HTML5
warnings are not enough.

00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:14.960
If you add an attribute
required to a form element,

00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:19.150
some browsers automatically add
form validation to the input

00:31:19.150 --> 00:31:21.320
and prevent you from
submitting the form.

00:31:22.930 --> 00:31:27.300
If you don't want that, you have
to add No Validate as attribute

00:31:27.300 --> 00:31:32.150
to the form element so that
validation doesn't pop up.

00:31:33.980 --> 00:31:37.000
There are three items
you need to keep in mind,

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:40.380
and I'll address them first
and then I do a quick demo

00:31:40.380 --> 00:31:41.420
with Gravity Forms.

00:31:43.150 --> 00:31:46.650
First, write clear
custom error messages.

00:31:47.710 --> 00:31:53.130
This field is required is not enough,
provide a follow-up email address,

00:31:53.130 --> 00:31:54.450
please fill out your name.

00:31:55.460 --> 00:31:58.350
These fields required
is just too generic.

00:32:00.730 --> 00:32:05.090
In case of more than two entries, add
a summary of errors above the form.

00:32:06.650 --> 00:32:10.580
That's super useful also for
people who are blind or people

00:32:10.580 --> 00:32:11.580
who use a keyboard.

00:32:13.660 --> 00:32:17.250
Then for the validation
messages with the input field,

00:32:17.250 --> 00:32:20.640
use aria-describedby to
connect the error to the input.

00:32:24.170 --> 00:32:28.750
On the Gravity Forms website,
there is external documentation

00:32:28.750 --> 00:32:30.850
on how to make forms accessible.

00:32:33.980 --> 00:32:39.300
There is information for content
providers, for developers.

00:32:39.300 --> 00:32:44.090
There is information about the
warnings on the fields in the admin

00:32:44.090 --> 00:32:47.740
for designers, and there's also
an accessibility checklist.

00:32:52.140 --> 00:33:00.530
It takes you step-by-step through
the settings, how to compose a form

00:33:00.530 --> 00:33:02.230
with accessibility in mind.

00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:09.240
This is a super useful page if you
create a form with Gravity Forms.

00:33:14.040 --> 00:33:16.680
How does form validation
work in Gravity Forms?

00:33:16.680 --> 00:33:22.420
This is an accessible form
with a name that's required

00:33:22.420 --> 00:33:24.710
and an email address
that's required.

00:33:24.710 --> 00:33:27.190
That's an area
described by message.

00:33:27.190 --> 00:33:31.660
We will use your email address
only to send you the newsletter

00:33:31.660 --> 00:33:32.770

00:33:34.710 --> 00:33:36.480
I will read it with
VoiceOver in Safari.

00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:38.717

00:34:19.870 --> 00:34:23.630
<v Rian> Also the screen reader will
announce that there are problems

00:34:23.630 --> 00:34:25.000
with your submission.

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:29.540
If you're blind,
you also get the notification that

00:34:29.540 --> 00:34:34.910
"Okay, I didn't fill it out right,"
or, "I need some extra information

00:34:34.910 --> 00:34:35.907
to fill out."

00:34:37.470 --> 00:34:42.810
All the information is given by
a screen reader and it's easy,

00:34:42.810 --> 00:34:44.160
accessible with a keyboard.

00:34:46.580 --> 00:34:50.240
If you want to know more about
how to create accessible forms

00:34:50.240 --> 00:34:54.800
or accessibility on the A11Y
collective, this A11y-collective.com.

00:34:56.080 --> 00:34:58.661
We have a course
about accessible code,

00:34:58.662 --> 00:35:00.920
with the last chapter about forms.

00:35:03.850 --> 00:35:04.430
Conclusion.

00:35:07.075 --> 00:35:11.350
<v Morgan> The main takeaway here
is have empathy for your users,

00:35:11.350 --> 00:35:13.910
and that means all of your users.

00:35:15.840 --> 00:35:18.760
Those who need assistive technology
and those who don't, think

00:35:18.760 --> 00:35:21.590
about absolutely everybody who is
going to be filling out your form

00:35:23.955 --> 00:35:28.650
<v Rian> Don't create anxiety
by not being predictable,

00:35:28.650 --> 00:35:33.340
by giving people too short time,
or doing unexpected things.

00:35:35.230 --> 00:35:36.310
Be trustworthy.

00:35:37.630 --> 00:35:42.620
<v Morgan> Be predictable,
make sure you explain

00:35:42.620 --> 00:35:45.830
what will happen next,
either when a user clicks a button

00:35:45.830 --> 00:35:48.180
to go to the next page or
when they submit the form.

00:35:50.430 --> 00:35:55.600
<v Rian> Form validation
is super important.

00:35:55.600 --> 00:35:58.850
Write good confirmation
and error messages.

00:35:59.925 --> 00:36:01.130
<v Morgan> Keep it simple.

00:36:01.130 --> 00:36:05.130
Avoid overcomplicating your forms
and don't make users have to think

00:36:05.130 --> 00:36:10.700
or second guess or cause stress
as they fill out the form.

00:36:12.390 --> 00:36:16.670
<v Rian> Help all users to fill
out your form and make the form

00:36:16.670 --> 00:36:19.070
as easy to fill out for everyone.

00:36:22.700 --> 00:36:23.700
Thank you.

00:36:30.970 --> 00:36:32.110
That was the presentation.

00:36:32.110 --> 00:36:34.610
We'll ask why don't we
take questions if you want.

00:36:34.610 --> 00:36:38.060
<v Abbas> Thank you so
much, Rian, and Morgan.

00:36:39.310 --> 00:36:41.600
W have a number of
questions that came in here.

00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:46.000
The first one is, what considerations
do you need to think about

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:48.890
when a user misses
a required field?

00:36:48.890 --> 00:36:51.140
How will the reader
react to the situation?

00:36:51.140 --> 00:36:53.210
Is there a needed code to comply?

00:36:58.149 --> 00:37:01.220
<v Morgan> I think we've
covered that pretty thoroughly

00:37:01.220 --> 00:37:04.980
in the voiceover
demonstration of what happens

00:37:07.220 --> 00:37:09.350
when there are required
fields in a form.

00:37:09.350 --> 00:37:14.550
Mostly that Aria-describedby
is the really important thing

00:37:14.550 --> 00:37:17.740
to make sure that the error
message is connected to the field.

00:37:20.205 --> 00:37:21.040
<v Abbas> Thank you.

00:37:21.845 --> 00:37:25.760
Do you have any thoughts about
empty choices in dropdowns?

00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:28.770
This person usually adds
an empty choice at the top

00:37:28.770 --> 00:37:31.900
of the required drop-down, so the
first choice won't be selected

00:37:31.900 --> 00:37:32.900
by default.

00:37:36.380 --> 00:37:40.000
<v Rian> I think if you make it
clear that that's an empty choice,

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:41.690
that's okay.

00:37:41.690 --> 00:37:43.110
It happens a lot.

00:37:43.110 --> 00:37:45.220
I think it's not
unexpected behavior.

00:37:47.132 --> 00:37:49.360
<v Morgan> Actually, when I was
putting together screenshots

00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:52.214
for this, I had a form that
had a drop-down at the top

00:37:52.215 --> 00:37:53.200
that was required.

00:37:54.420 --> 00:37:56.280
I didn't fill it out when
I submitted the form,

00:37:56.280 --> 00:37:58.310
so I could take a picture
of the error message.

00:37:58.310 --> 00:38:01.310
I was surprised that the error
message didn't include that dropdown,

00:38:01.310 --> 00:38:05.520
and it was because there wasn't
an empty value at the top.

00:38:07.080 --> 00:38:11.190
If you don't have an empty
value, and a field is required,

00:38:11.190 --> 00:38:14.970
and the user doesn't fill out the
field, that first option is going

00:38:14.970 --> 00:38:17.810
to be selected by default,
The browser will never realize that

00:38:17.810 --> 00:38:20.120
that form hasn't been filled out.

00:38:20.120 --> 00:38:22.880
If that field is required, having
an empty option is a good idea.

00:38:25.238 --> 00:38:26.327
<v Abbas> Thank you.

00:38:27.320 --> 00:38:31.110
What is the best way to
deal with form-fill spam

00:38:31.110 --> 00:38:32.790
with the invisible CAPTCHA?

00:38:32.790 --> 00:38:37.200
Will version 3 solve the issue while
still maintaining form accessibility?

00:38:41.986 --> 00:38:42.860
<v Rian> I don't know.

00:38:42.860 --> 00:38:43.860
[laughter]

00:38:46.610 --> 00:38:49.050
There are a few
options like Honeypots.

00:38:53.260 --> 00:38:56.400
Yes, spam is really the
evil of today, I think.

00:39:02.373 --> 00:39:03.590
Did I mention that?

00:39:05.477 --> 00:39:06.970
<v Morgan> You talked
about turnstile?

00:39:06.970 --> 00:39:08.010
<v Rian> Turnstile, yes.

00:39:08.518 --> 00:39:10.422
I don't know I haven't researched,

00:39:10.423 --> 00:39:13.260
but maybe that's an
option if it fits.

00:39:13.260 --> 00:39:16.290
I think Google version 3
has really privacy issues.

00:39:18.470 --> 00:39:22.190
That Google watches what
you're doing on the page.

00:39:24.596 --> 00:39:27.910
<v Morgan> A Honeypot might be a
better option than a reCAPTCHA.

00:39:29.380 --> 00:39:31.420
Spam is always a moving
target, though.

00:39:31.420 --> 00:39:33.430
We come up with spam
prevention things

00:39:33.430 --> 00:39:35.100
and then spammers
find ways around them,

00:39:35.100 --> 00:39:39.500
so it requires some constant
vigilance and research.

00:39:44.579 --> 00:39:48.210
<v Abbas> Do you know how Google
Forms are set up for the form fields

00:39:48.210 --> 00:39:49.210
and how it's read?

00:39:50.698 --> 00:39:51.960
<v Rian> I haven't researched it.

00:39:51.960 --> 00:39:52.960
<v Morgan> No idea.

00:39:55.026 --> 00:39:59.510
<v Rian> With the knowledge you
now have, you can actually [laughs]

00:39:59.510 --> 00:40:01.480
try it yourself.

00:40:01.480 --> 00:40:06.110
Those that have a label, at least the
label attached to the input field.

00:40:06.110 --> 00:40:09.870
If you don't fill anything out,
do you get real good warnings

00:40:09.870 --> 00:40:10.970
and error messages?

00:40:13.310 --> 00:40:15.740
Try it yourself at home.

00:40:17.282 --> 00:40:20.100
<v Abbas> Reanne,
can you expand why it's helpful

00:40:20.100 --> 00:40:24.350
to lay out the steps for a user,
and does that prevent user fatigue?

00:40:25.156 --> 00:40:26.030
<v Rian> To lay out what?

00:40:27.659 --> 00:40:30.440
<v Abbas> To prevent user fatigue,
to lay out the steps for the form

00:40:30.440 --> 00:40:31.440
for a user.

00:40:33.640 --> 00:40:35.740
<v Rian> I don't think
it's for fatigue.

00:40:35.740 --> 00:40:37.400
I think it's for anxiety.

00:40:38.536 --> 00:40:38.960
<v Abbas> Okay.

00:40:41.239 --> 00:40:48.710
<v Rian> I think it's to make
people sure that they actually know.

00:40:52.140 --> 00:40:55.710
If it's a long-form that
people in the middle think,

00:40:55.710 --> 00:40:57.770
"Okay, that's so much, I quit."

00:40:59.110 --> 00:41:00.590
That's what you mean with fatigue?

00:41:01.850 --> 00:41:05.750
I think doing it in
steps makes it easier

00:41:05.750 --> 00:41:12.430
and people have a better
overview, its usability

00:41:12.430 --> 00:41:15.640
and better user experience.

00:41:17.475 --> 00:41:21.300
<v Abbas> If I may I'm going
to add to that, especially

00:41:21.300 --> 00:41:24.070
for forms that are taking long
and in some cases people have

00:41:24.070 --> 00:41:27.570
to look up something,
or step away for a moment,

00:41:27.570 --> 00:41:31.000
and occasionally the browser would
refresh and they lose everything.

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:34.410
This may be a more general
question, but you have any thoughts

00:41:34.410 --> 00:41:39.090
on caching user input into a form?

00:41:39.090 --> 00:41:42.230
I've seen that happen sometimes and
I find it much more helpful like

00:41:42.230 --> 00:41:46.770
if I type a paragraph and then
navigate somewhere, or in some cases

00:41:46.770 --> 00:41:48.830
if you lose focus and
navigate and you come back

00:41:48.830 --> 00:41:51.780
and it disappears versus
in some cases it stays.

00:41:51.780 --> 00:41:56.070
Is that strictly a browser issue
or is there somewhere to ensure,

00:41:56.070 --> 00:41:58.100
"Okay, I'm not going to lose
all my input, especially

00:41:58.100 --> 00:42:00.680
for longer forms, and especially
for forms that are broken up

00:42:00.680 --> 00:42:02.350
in different steps?"

00:42:04.522 --> 00:42:07.600
<v Morgan> I think that's
mostly browser behavior.

00:42:08.850 --> 00:42:11.530
Over the past few years,
browsers have gotten a lot better--

00:42:11.530 --> 00:42:14.060
I've had that experience
where your browser crashes

00:42:14.060 --> 00:42:17.220
or your computer crashes, and you'd
spent an hour filling out this thing.

00:42:17.220 --> 00:42:18.920
You don't want to lose everything.

00:42:18.920 --> 00:42:25.150
I think that's mostly
browser behavior.

00:42:25.150 --> 00:42:28.900
I think Chrome, in particular,
is really good about just remembering

00:42:28.900 --> 00:42:33.630
what you've filled in, but I
don't know off the top of my head.

00:42:35.320 --> 00:42:38.870
You'd have to have some sort of
mechanism for storing all of that

00:42:38.870 --> 00:42:41.410
in browser storage,
which could get complicated.

00:42:44.336 --> 00:42:47.170
<v Abbas> If anybody has any
additional questions please feel free

00:42:47.170 --> 00:42:48.990
to put them in the Slido.

00:42:48.990 --> 00:42:51.710
I guess we could take another
moment here just to see

00:42:51.710 --> 00:42:52.670
if anything else comes in.

00:42:53.336 --> 00:42:54.040
If there are [inaudible]

00:42:54.040 --> 00:42:57.175
there's any other follow-up thoughts
that either of you would like to add.

00:42:58.843 --> 00:42:59.911
Hello to the kitty.

00:42:59.911 --> 00:43:03.414
[laughter]

00:43:24.135 --> 00:43:24.849
All right.

00:43:24.850 --> 00:43:27.560
Well, it looks like--
Oh, here we go.

00:43:27.560 --> 00:43:28.560
We have another one coming in.

00:43:29.874 --> 00:43:35.079
Your opinion on IFrame forms from
Hotspot and Pardot and et cetera?

00:43:38.570 --> 00:43:40.590
<v Rian> Well I'm not
going to give an opinion,

00:43:40.590 --> 00:43:45.300
but forms I haven't researched,
so I really don't know.

00:43:47.030 --> 00:43:50.190
I do know if you want
an accessible site

00:43:50.190 --> 00:43:53.770
and you have a third-party
application like Search a Form

00:43:53.770 --> 00:43:59.190
in an Iframe, do your research
if that third-party application

00:43:59.190 --> 00:44:02.980
is accessible too,
because it's part of your process.

00:44:04.740 --> 00:44:09.180
Maybe you say, "Oh no, it's off-topic
because it's from somebody else,"

00:44:09.180 --> 00:44:13.810
but if a visitor needs that
application to perform task,

00:44:13.810 --> 00:44:15.560
then that needs to
be accessible too.

00:44:18.090 --> 00:44:21.220
Make do your research
before you actually import

00:44:21.220 --> 00:44:25.390
such a third-party
application or an IFrame.

00:44:28.399 --> 00:44:29.490
<v Abbas> Thank you.

00:44:29.490 --> 00:44:31.630
We do want to give just a quick--
Oh, we just missed him.

00:44:31.630 --> 00:44:33.880
We just wanted to give a
quick shout-out to Edgar.

00:44:33.880 --> 00:44:35.800
Thank you for such a great session.

00:44:35.800 --> 00:44:43.040
His work is delightful and impossible
to ignore, so thank him once again.

00:44:43.040 --> 00:44:45.650
It looks like we don't really
have anymore questions coming in.

00:44:45.650 --> 00:44:47.450
If it's okay,
I will go ahead and wrap up

00:44:47.450 --> 00:44:49.100
and I will tell you
both thank you so much

00:44:49.100 --> 00:44:50.950
for an amazingly informal session.

00:44:52.210 --> 00:44:55.560
I want to just let everybody know
they can continue the conversation

00:44:55.560 --> 00:44:57.640
in the chat or on social media.

00:44:57.640 --> 00:45:02.490
Please use the hashtag wpa11yday.

00:45:02.490 --> 00:45:07.820
That's wpliday and
the wpad2022 hashtags.

00:45:08.860 --> 00:45:10.760
We also would
appreciate if you go to

00:45:10.760 --> 00:45:15.046
the
wordpressaccessibility.day/feedback

00:45:15.046 --> 00:45:16.540
to provide anonymous feedback

00:45:16.540 --> 00:45:19.200
for our speakers on
their presentation.

00:45:19.200 --> 00:45:21.210
You can enter to win a
T-shirt while you're there.

00:45:22.290 --> 00:45:25.080
Coming up next, please stay
tune, we have the proof,

00:45:25.080 --> 00:45:30.210
accessible websites can be beautiful
too, coming with Gary Osante

00:45:30.210 --> 00:45:32.060
and Steven Plummer.

00:45:32.060 --> 00:45:34.590

00:45:38.710 --> 00:45:40.920
Thank you two both so
much again and hopefully,

00:45:40.920 --> 00:45:43.030
we will see everybody here
right after the break.

00:45:43.030 --> 00:45:44.730
<v Rian> Thank you so very much.

00:45:44.730 --> 00:45:48.340
This is a very well-organized
and absolutely fabulous event.

00:45:48.340 --> 00:45:50.880
Thank you,
and it's an honor to be here.

00:45:50.880 --> 00:45:52.590
<v Morgan> Yes, thank you.

00:45:52.590 --> 00:45:54.540
<v Abbas> All right,
thanks, everybody.

00:45:54.541 --> 00:45:55.170
<v Rian> Bye.
