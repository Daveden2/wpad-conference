00:00:00.047 --> 00:00:30.492
[pause]

00:00:30.493 --> 00:00:32.130
>> DANIELLE ZARCARO: Hello again.

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.340
Welcome to WordPress
Accessibility Day.

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.440
My name is Danielle, and I'm
the founder of Overnight Website

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.280
and Kinetic Iris Web
Development Studio.

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:44.590
Thank you for joining us.

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:49.740
We have our session now
Inclusive Coding and Design

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:55.660
with Andrija Radojev
and Lazar Bulatovic.

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:57.540
I apologize immensely.

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:59.726
[chuckles]

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:04.550
Andrija is the founder of the
Video Game Studio Thunders Strike

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:08.260
and has been involved in WordPress
development for six years.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.830
Apart from his main specialty
of WooCommerce development,

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:14.720
he is also specialized
in website optimization

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.920
and website accessibility technology
development and implementation.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.730
Then we have Lazar.

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:25.120
He helps entrepreneurs get
confident as presenters

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.690
and sell more using the
power of public speaking.

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:32.460
He is also a well-versed user
of screen reader software

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.740
and other assistive technology
products for the blind

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.340
due to the experience
of more than 15 years

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.050
and provides accessibility
testing services.

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.730
Please feel free to add your
questions in the Q&A tab next

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:50.120
to the video, and we will answer
them at the end of the session.

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:54.210
Use the ideas tab to chat
with the other attendees.

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.670
With that, let's take it away.

00:02:00.754 --> 00:02:01.690
>> LAZAR BULATOVIC: [inaudible]

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:02.840
can you see me well?

00:02:06.374 --> 00:02:09.528
>> ANDRIJA RADOJEV: Can you
adjust your camera a bit,

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.400
so we can see your face.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.310
>> LAZAR: Let me know.

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:14.160
Shall I put it up?

00:02:15.335 --> 00:02:17.111
>> ANDRIJA: Yes, put it up.

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:21.590
Perfect.

00:02:21.591 --> 00:02:28.941
>> LAZAR: Okay,
so what is your favorite food?

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:35.000
Whether you are at your
house, office, or home?

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.840
Please say it loudly in
three, two, one.

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:41.840
Now.

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:45.100
Good.

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:52.090
Now imagine you are very hungry
because you haven't eaten

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.100
for three days, no matter why.

00:02:55.570 --> 00:03:01.220
You walk around, you find a
shop selling the favorite food

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:02.220
you just mentioned.

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:08.620
Fragrance is nice, price is good,
and it looks delicious, hmm, yummy,

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:15.720
but the payment place
is set too high.

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:21.950
The desk is set too high, so you
cannot pay it, and you can't have it.

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:24.500
How would you feel?

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:25.500
Think for a while?

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.060
Frustrated, furious, sad.

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.660
Although I can't know your
reaction at the moment.

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:38.030
This is what many people with
disabilities get through.

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:45.260
Some little and simple
tasks becomes a nightmare,

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:50.960
just because developers and designers
don't have accessibility in mind.

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:54.020
Difference.

00:03:55.270 --> 00:04:01.020
Today, there are many definitions
of accessibility, but I'm not going

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:02.020
to share any of them.

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:04.030
You can Google it.

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:12.940
Today, I want to tell you what
are some basics of screen readers.

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:14.560
You will learn that.

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:18.640
You will also feel how do
people with disabilities,

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:24.610
especially screen users actually
experience accessibility

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:25.660
in everyday lives.

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:30.394
Hopefully,
you will start incorporating

00:04:30.395 --> 00:04:34.140
your accessibility standards
into your projects.

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:44.250
Coming to that, let's start
with something very important.

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:53.610
Accessibility should be
crucial for everyone, and yes,

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:57.870
truth be told not so many
developers care about accessibility.

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:01.170
It's not because they are
bad persons per se, no.

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:06.360
Although sometimes your
services are damn expensive, no.

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:10.320
It's because the lack of
education and the lack

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:13.140
of education causing
lack of accessibility.

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:18.120
This is my personal definition
of accessibility in this context.

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:23.743
Accessible product or website means

00:05:23.744 --> 00:05:27.850
that all of its
features are available

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:34.250
to all persons regarding on various
disabilities without any support

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:37.900
except the assistive technology
devices they are using

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:43.400
in everyday lives,
such as screen mirror or magnifier.

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:51.060
Now, you developers and
designers have a huge power.

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:57.950
You have a power to change
the lives of hundreds

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:00.160
of thousands of people
with disabilities,

00:06:01.585 --> 00:06:03.920
to help them find new job,

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:11.610
help them buy things, have fun, and
overall, lead a more prosperous life.

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:22.930
Most of you understand
that-- probably all of you

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:27.230
because if this is not the
case you wouldn't be here now.

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:30.930
You do understand that all
websites should be accessible

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:34.260
to all people regardless
on disability.

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:40.460
Just for today's purpose, we are
going to cover the web accessibility

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:46.360
for screen reader users, and most of
them are blind or visually impaired.

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:53.500
I also assume that
most of you understand

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:58.170
how does the screen work and how
do blind people use computer,

00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:03.200
but let's do a quick overview for
those who are listening to this

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:06.030
for the first time.

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:08.200
Let's see what
screen reader is not.

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:14.060
Screen reader is not
a different interface.

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:19.970
Screen reader is not an
operating system, that's obvious,

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:24.310
and screen reader is not
our accessibility advocate.

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:26.470
We are.

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:34.760
Screen reader is actually a
speech software that converts text

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:35.760
into speech.

00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:43.470
Now, there are various screen readers
for different operating systems.

00:07:43.470 --> 00:07:48.880
For example, on Windows, the most
popular ones are JAWS, Commentary.

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:54.180
For Android,
we have Commentary and TalkBack.

00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:57.340
For iOS, there is a VoiceOver,
and so on and so forth.

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:06.340
However, to enjoy all the
things of what screen reader has

00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:13.090
to offer, its users must
understand and must remember

00:08:13.090 --> 00:08:19.550
many keyboard shortcuts that are
associated with screen reader only.

00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:23.210
For example,
if your screen reader is turned on,

00:08:23.210 --> 00:08:30.680
and you press Insert F7, you are
most likely bring the list of links

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:31.830
on that web page.

00:08:35.130 --> 00:08:39.200
On the other hand,
if your screen reader is turned off

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:42.650
and you press the same keys
stroke on the same web page,

00:08:42.650 --> 00:08:44.770
chances are you'll get nothing.

00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:52.820
Now, here is what many people
don't know, but the development

00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:55.800
of screen reader
has a long history.

00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:58.130
Its history are
longer than 30 years.

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:04.060
This is very complex software
that updates regularly.

00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:09.700
You can see your screen here
as something very sophisticated

00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:14.921
rather than a program
that speaks randomly.

00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:26.230
Although screen reader
definitely has many features,

00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:33.930
we can't do everything without
support of developers and designers.

00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:39.810
This is why your role is key here.

00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:42.200
You have a crucial role here.

00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:49.590
In my opinion,
there are three reasons

00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:54.600
for which you should start
implementing accessibility standards

00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:56.010
into your future projects.

00:09:57.230 --> 00:10:00.250
First, money talks.

00:10:00.250 --> 00:10:05.110
I won't go for details for
statistics today, but it's proven

00:10:05.110 --> 00:10:09.355
that accessible web
stores and websites

00:10:09.356 --> 00:10:13.070
actually generate much more profit

00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:17.440
in comparison with their
counterparts that are not accessible.

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:21.820
Second, gather visibility.

00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:26.900
If your website has perfectly
set elements such as headings,

00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:32.600
buttons, checkboxes, et cetera,
the visibility will increase,

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:34.670
and more people will
know about the website.

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:39.710
This is something that, say, your
experts can tell you more about it.

00:10:41.690 --> 00:10:45.710
Third, recommendations.

00:10:45.710 --> 00:10:49.960
If people with disabilities
see that your website is good

00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:52.778
and they have a great
user experience,

00:10:53.319 --> 00:10:56.656
they will recommend the website
to their friends and family.

00:11:03.450 --> 00:11:09.900
Now how does the inaccessible
websites actually affect daily lives

00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:10.970
of screen reader users?

00:11:12.030 --> 00:11:13.350
We will cover this in a moment.

00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:18.890
Until we reach that,
please understand that

00:11:18.890 --> 00:11:21.190
just because something
looks accessible

00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:26.270
to you does not mean it is
accessible to screen reader users.

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:32.690
This is why there is a huge
difference between automated testing

00:11:32.690 --> 00:11:33.690
and manual testing.

00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:39.190
Andrija will cover this shortly.

00:11:39.190 --> 00:11:46.770
Everything should get dusted manually
ideally by the users themselves.

00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:51.240
One more very important thing.

00:11:53.950 --> 00:11:58.480
Just because something works well
with the keyboard does not mean

00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:05.380
it will be compatible
with the screen reader.

00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:10.230
What are some accessibility examples
and some daily accessibility examples

00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:17.140
that make my life and lives of
many security reader users get

00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:18.140
more difficult?

00:12:20.010 --> 00:12:21.450
Let me illustrate this.

00:12:21.450 --> 00:12:26.740
I wanted to open a bank account,
and I visited the website.

00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:28.610
I wanted to do it totally online.

00:12:29.970 --> 00:12:33.130
Then I started completing the form.

00:12:33.130 --> 00:12:38.400
I put my first name, my last name,
click next, and then I said, "Okay.

00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:44.470
You will now receive an SMS code, and
then just type the code in the box.

00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:47.210
Click next,
and you'll be able to go on."

00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:55.180
I received the code, I clicked next,
and then they said, "Okay, very good.

00:12:55.180 --> 00:13:00.380
Now, please agree with
our terms and conditions.

00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:05.190
Click on continue,
and your account will be open."

00:13:05.190 --> 00:13:11.470
The trick was the checkbox
was not accessible.

00:13:12.830 --> 00:13:15.770
They could not check
it and proceed.

00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:21.410
Now, I'm sure that
this is something,

00:13:21.410 --> 00:13:25.710
which developers can
resolve it easily.

00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:32.970
This thing actually made my
life much more difficult.

00:13:32.970 --> 00:13:33.970
Guess what I did?

00:13:34.790 --> 00:13:39.750
Well, I left the
website and that's it.

00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:43.850
This bank actually
refused to take my money

00:13:43.850 --> 00:13:46.580
because of those minor mistakes.

00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:53.280
One more example.

00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:59.730
I have my own business,
and I have two accounts.

00:13:59.730 --> 00:14:04.110
The first one is business account,
and another one is a personal account

00:14:04.110 --> 00:14:06.290
in the same bank.

00:14:06.290 --> 00:14:13.570
I wanted to transfer funds from my
business account to the personal one.

00:14:13.570 --> 00:14:14.970
Everything worked fine.

00:14:14.970 --> 00:14:16.720
I completed the form.

00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:21.870
However, at the very end
of the process, I was asked

00:14:21.870 --> 00:14:30.050
to simply choose the payment purpose,
but the combo box was terrible.

00:14:30.050 --> 00:14:31.520
It did not function correctly.

00:14:32.950 --> 00:14:38.110
I could not use my arrow
keys to select the purpose

00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:39.940
and complete the transfer.

00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:43.300
There are some more examples.

00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:49.960
For example, very badly organized
web shops where I cannot find

00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:53.150
what I need, or it takes me
much longer time to do that.

00:14:54.550 --> 00:14:57.190
Also, unclickable links.

00:14:57.190 --> 00:14:58.500
Can you imagine?

00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:04.510
You are on the website
and you basically want

00:15:04.510 --> 00:15:07.710
to know something very
important, for example, about us

00:15:07.710 --> 00:15:12.130
or how to pay us or how
to purchase this and that,

00:15:12.130 --> 00:15:13.690
how to place the order?

00:15:13.690 --> 00:15:17.080
Then you press enter on the
link and nothing happens,

00:15:18.290 --> 00:15:19.840
that unclickable link.

00:15:21.270 --> 00:15:25.810
Date pickers, especially if
you want to book a flight.

00:15:25.810 --> 00:15:33.180
For example, some travel
companies are not accessible.

00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:36.590
I want to book a flight,
but I cannot choose my dates.

00:15:36.590 --> 00:15:40.460
They basically lose
money because of that.

00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:45.370
Now, I'm sure that all of those
things are very easy to resolve.

00:15:47.410 --> 00:15:54.310
Then you have content on blogs
articles that is represented

00:15:54.310 --> 00:15:55.310
through graphic.

00:15:56.090 --> 00:15:58.760
This is also very
difficult for me to read,

00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:01.820
especially if I enjoy the content.

00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:06.110
For example,
I'm passionate about public speaking

00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:11.010
and I'm reading a blog and some of
their articles are not accessible

00:16:11.010 --> 00:16:15.430
because the content is
written within a graphic.

00:16:15.430 --> 00:16:18.670
It also happens in
on Facebook sometimes

00:16:18.670 --> 00:16:24.250
if the information
is placed like that.

00:16:27.150 --> 00:16:28.440
Now, let's vote.

00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:34.270
I have good news and bad news.

00:16:34.270 --> 00:16:36.680
Which one do you
want to hear first?

00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:40.060
Let's vote and please let me
know if you have the results.

00:16:47.588 --> 00:16:50.450
>> DANIELLE: Let's go ahead and
give us some bad news first.

00:16:50.450 --> 00:16:51.450
>> LAZAR: Okay.

00:16:52.870 --> 00:17:03.100
Bad news is that almost 90% of
websites that I have visited so far

00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:05.500
in my experience,
which is more than 15 years,

00:17:08.790 --> 00:17:12.030
most of them have certain
accessibility issues.

00:17:14.470 --> 00:17:17.928
The good news is that
the accessibility

00:17:17.929 --> 00:17:20.090
is not a rocket science.

00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:28.140
Now, let's go into practice.

00:17:29.580 --> 00:17:32.100
I'll now get seated.

00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:33.320
I'll now show you something.

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:44.920
Let me know if you can
see my face correctly.

00:17:48.534 --> 00:17:49.335
>> ANDRIJA: Yes.

00:17:49.335 --> 00:17:50.636
>> LAZAR: Great.

00:17:52.950 --> 00:17:59.070
I will now give you
something very interesting.

00:17:59.070 --> 00:18:01.520
This website is very inaccessible.

00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:17.781
[background noise]

00:18:18.997 --> 00:18:21.944
Let me just reopen them.

00:18:21.944 --> 00:18:35.815
[background noise]

00:18:35.815 --> 00:18:38.360
This website is
extremely accessible.

00:18:43.370 --> 00:18:44.370
Everything works fine.

00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:48.580
Headings are perfect.

00:18:48.580 --> 00:18:55.600
I press H. There is main menu,
popular today, recently added,

00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:07.660
strictly on soft difference.

00:19:09.110 --> 00:19:12.740
There is a category, so combo
boxes are working correctly.

00:19:15.388 --> 00:19:22.810
Then we have a website,
which is done for testing purposes,

00:19:22.810 --> 00:19:24.640
but it's not very accessible.

00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:30.210
Let me just find it
because for some reason,

00:19:30.210 --> 00:19:31.620
it's not shared at the moment.

00:19:31.620 --> 00:19:54.627
[background noise]

00:19:54.627 --> 00:19:55.661
Here it is.

00:20:00.299 --> 00:20:01.267
This one.

00:20:06.956 --> 00:20:08.060
Blank.

00:20:08.060 --> 00:20:09.240
Nothing is horrible here.

00:20:11.344 --> 00:20:14.180
Unlabeled graphic,
which means I cannot--

00:20:19.503 --> 00:20:24.280
There is some text
that I don't understand.

00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:33.850
There is a table obviously,
but for me, it's just nothing

00:20:33.850 --> 00:20:38.700
because I can't-- this numbers.

00:20:47.410 --> 00:20:48.800
Let's say events.

00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:53.270
December 1st, click on the
link, great holiday event.

00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:58.630
I press enter, and nothing happens.

00:21:01.250 --> 00:21:05.620
Start your application,
required fields are in blue.

00:21:05.620 --> 00:21:09.140
How can a blind person see
that something is blue?

00:21:14.106 --> 00:21:14.680
It [inaudible]

00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:16.620
security test.

00:21:16.620 --> 00:21:19.245
Please enter the two words you see.

00:21:19.245 --> 00:21:22.648
Simply,
tell that that's not possible.

00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:31.730
Now look, I know that you might say,
"Oh, the first website looks awful."

00:21:32.810 --> 00:21:34.700
You can say that.

00:21:34.700 --> 00:21:36.050
I trust you, and I believe you.

00:21:36.050 --> 00:21:41.180
Although I never seen that, but
those are just two extreme examples.

00:21:45.590 --> 00:21:49.480
Accessibility and
design go hand in hand.

00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:55.150
I don't think that something must
be let's say wrongly designed

00:21:55.150 --> 00:21:59.290
to be accessible, so beautiful
and accessible are friends.

00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:04.440
Now, after all of this,
I want you to ask you a question.

00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:07.720
Let's respond it for yourself.

00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:14.650
Are you ready to start incorporating
and thinking about accessibility

00:22:14.650 --> 00:22:16.680
in your future project?

00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:19.550
Start paying more attention
to that so all people,

00:22:19.550 --> 00:22:22.580
regardless of disability
can enjoy your products.

00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:29.210
If yes, great,
I'll be happy to help you with that.

00:22:29.210 --> 00:22:30.470
Please add me on LinkedIn.

00:22:31.970 --> 00:22:36.890
My contact details are in the
schedule or probably in the chat

00:22:36.890 --> 00:22:37.890
if someone wants to put it.

00:22:39.730 --> 00:22:43.610
I'm also a sticky code,
so if you need anything like that,

00:22:43.610 --> 00:22:46.040
let me know, and of course,
I'll be more than happy

00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:49.352
to do a manual testing
of your website

00:22:49.353 --> 00:22:52.240
or provide any advice that I can.

00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:53.490
Thank you very much.

00:22:53.490 --> 00:22:55.074
Andrija, the floor is yours now.

00:22:57.656 --> 00:22:59.359
>> ANDRIJA: Thanks, Lazar.

00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:00.950
Hey, guys.

00:23:00.950 --> 00:23:01.970
My name is Andrija.

00:23:03.030 --> 00:23:11.190
Lazar has just provided with
the answer to how accessibility

00:23:11.190 --> 00:23:15.100
and issues with accessibility
affect his daily life.

00:23:15.100 --> 00:23:18.310
Now I'm here to provide
you with the why.

00:23:19.870 --> 00:23:22.230
Why we overlook accessibility.

00:23:23.730 --> 00:23:31.450
Well, there are many reasons why
this happens, and it is specific set

00:23:31.450 --> 00:23:33.330
of circumstances.

00:23:33.330 --> 00:23:38.720
However, most common reasons
are limited budget and timeframe

00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:40.810
to complete the project.

00:23:40.810 --> 00:23:43.620
Generalize approach
to website design.

00:23:43.620 --> 00:23:48.270
Then the fact that accessibility
is a venue area that needs

00:23:48.270 --> 00:23:52.040
to be explored by developers
and the strict reliance

00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:56.290
on accessibility test tools.

00:23:56.290 --> 00:23:59.340
Let's talk about
budget and timeframe.

00:23:59.340 --> 00:24:03.710
This is sadly the most common
reason as each developer

00:24:03.710 --> 00:24:08.140
or digital agency strives for
that suite competitive edge.

00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:13.510
In itself,
surviving on the market stuff,

00:24:13.510 --> 00:24:17.380
especially if you do not
have many years of experience

00:24:17.380 --> 00:24:20.320
or reach portfolio to show off.

00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:24.380
This leads to compromises
in project valuation,

00:24:24.380 --> 00:24:28.220
overestimated or border
going unrealistic deadlines.

00:24:30.260 --> 00:24:35.090
Accessibility is never
mentioned in many of those cases

00:24:35.090 --> 00:24:39.480
as there is simply not enough
time, or the budget cannot cover

00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:41.510
even the basic
accessibility testing.

00:24:42.830 --> 00:24:48.040
Apart from that, many developers
struggle in selling the idea

00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:51.310
of an accessible website
to their clients.

00:24:51.310 --> 00:24:53.151
The poor time estimation

00:24:53.152 --> 00:24:56.910
or other factors can
easily create a time count

00:24:56.910 --> 00:24:59.070
from the project,
and delivering the project

00:24:59.070 --> 00:25:01.350
in time requires cutting corners.

00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:06.760
Of course, it is very easy to
get seduced by specific ratios

00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:09.460
of your customer and
focus on that in hopes

00:25:09.460 --> 00:25:11.740
that the creative elements
will be accessible.

00:25:12.890 --> 00:25:17.240
Basic user testing,
as you might have imagined,

00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:19.450
is very often skipped completely.

00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:25.189
How can we make sure that
accessibility is included

00:25:25.190 --> 00:25:25.830
in the project?

00:25:26.990 --> 00:25:29.790
By educating our clients.

00:25:29.790 --> 00:25:33.880
Show them the numbers,
local legislation tests, and benefits

00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:37.140
of an accessible website.

00:25:37.140 --> 00:25:41.560
This does require initial research
depending on client's business needs.

00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:45.200
However, a responsible
website will always say

00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:47.730
as if correct information
is presented to them.

00:25:49.990 --> 00:25:53.520
Don't forget that you are the
expert for the website design,

00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:56.640
and if you think about your
client in the longer run,

00:25:56.640 --> 00:26:01.030
most of your clients will
recognize and appreciate that.

00:26:01.030 --> 00:26:03.790
Now, let's say that you
didn't bother to check.

00:26:03.790 --> 00:26:06.740
You really needed this client,
and you did not pay attention

00:26:06.740 --> 00:26:07.780
to accessibility.

00:26:07.780 --> 00:26:13.430
With the legislation evolving and
making accessibility mandatory

00:26:13.430 --> 00:26:16.980
worldwide, you can get into
trouble with your client

00:26:16.980 --> 00:26:20.710
as they assumed that you
are already paying attention

00:26:20.710 --> 00:26:24.090
to accessibility,
and they can hold you responsible

00:26:24.090 --> 00:26:27.800
for revenue loss or
fines by authorities.

00:26:29.010 --> 00:26:33.590
Regardless of the current legislation
and whether they have a case

00:26:33.590 --> 00:26:35.520
on you or not,
probably, they don't.

00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:40.000
However, regardless of that,
you're not only losing that client

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.680
for good but also
gaining bad reputation.

00:26:44.050 --> 00:26:51.970
You know what they say, "Bad
reputation is a business killer."

00:26:56.450 --> 00:26:57.260
Damage is done.

00:26:57.260 --> 00:27:00.300
Let's say,
you are already working on a project

00:27:00.300 --> 00:27:03.760
and you have not allocated
any funds to using testing.

00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:08.430
Well, you can still test
your website on a zero budget

00:27:08.430 --> 00:27:10.450
and spend only a couple of hours.

00:27:10.450 --> 00:27:12.650
Yes, it won't be very good testing.

00:27:12.650 --> 00:27:18.720
However, you can focus on the basics,
get a helping hand from a friend.

00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:21.930
From that, you can get out with
a fully functional website,

00:27:21.930 --> 00:27:24.530
which is not fully accessible.

00:27:24.530 --> 00:27:28.200
However, that is not better than
having an inaccessible website

00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:31.080
that cannot serve
its basic purpose.

00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:37.020
That being said, let's talk
about the generalized approach

00:27:37.020 --> 00:27:38.020
to website design.

00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:41.080
This is probably the
second biggest piece.

00:27:42.350 --> 00:27:47.020
When we visualize the
website, our reflex is

00:27:47.020 --> 00:27:51.770
to first create a website
the way we would like to have

00:27:51.770 --> 00:27:54.990
if we were in the
business of our clients.

00:27:56.260 --> 00:27:59.370
Then we will focus
on majority of users

00:27:59.370 --> 00:28:03.150
and as you may have guessed,
majority of users will not use

00:28:03.150 --> 00:28:04.150
a screen reader.

00:28:04.780 --> 00:28:09.890
It is also common that web
accessibility is misinterpreted,

00:28:09.890 --> 00:28:15.810
confused with responsive design, or
not understood by developers at all.

00:28:15.810 --> 00:28:19.010
If you remember other story
in which he could not track

00:28:19.010 --> 00:28:22.770
a mandatory checkbox,
this situation happened

00:28:22.770 --> 00:28:27.120
due to the fact someone wanted to
create a fancy hooking track box

00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:32.690
using developments that are easier
to style than the input element.

00:28:32.690 --> 00:28:36.300
This small, so to
say, small oversight,

00:28:36.300 --> 00:28:41.780
basically denied any screen reader
users from becoming a client

00:28:41.780 --> 00:28:42.780
of this bank.

00:28:44.110 --> 00:28:49.140
It is essential to put some
more effort in understanding

00:28:49.140 --> 00:28:51.300
how people use the website.

00:28:51.300 --> 00:28:54.280
Assuming that they
have a helping hand

00:28:54.280 --> 00:28:56.980
or that they will
not use your website

00:28:56.980 --> 00:29:01.880
in the first place is a cardinal
scene of a website design.

00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:04.030
I cannot emphasize this enough.

00:29:04.030 --> 00:29:07.970
Do not try to reinvent the wheel.

00:29:07.970 --> 00:29:12.080
There is a reason why
input type checkbox exists,

00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:16.510
and you should use it even if
that means more time and effort

00:29:16.510 --> 00:29:21.010
to style this development or giving
up on the style concept at all.

00:29:22.230 --> 00:29:24.320
Find the middle ground
with your client.

00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:32.170
Let them know why a specific
design choice is not good.

00:29:32.170 --> 00:29:38.580
Next up, why is website
accessibility so intimidating?

00:29:38.580 --> 00:29:43.890
It is a brand new area to explore.

00:29:43.890 --> 00:29:46.040
As we talk about the
basics, the truth is

00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:49.840
that we are merely scratching the
surface of website accessibility.

00:29:53.570 --> 00:29:58.630
With so much different tools,
assistive technology that exists,

00:29:58.630 --> 00:30:05.290
and the different use case that
is a huge mountain to climb.

00:30:05.290 --> 00:30:11.630
Many people choose not to
climb, but instead to stick

00:30:11.630 --> 00:30:16.140
to old coding standards and
habits as this is an easy way,

00:30:16.140 --> 00:30:18.820
or at least so they think.

00:30:18.820 --> 00:30:22.970
I'm just going to put the contract
because I'm not responsible

00:30:22.970 --> 00:30:24.110
for accessibility.

00:30:24.110 --> 00:30:26.069
Then the clients need

00:30:26.069 --> 00:30:29.860
to hire specialist accessibility
testers developers.

00:30:29.860 --> 00:30:34.190
I'm not viable by all, et cetera.

00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:42.520
Now, although exploring a brand new
set of tools does look intimidating.

00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:46.875
Not even the top website
accessibility experts know

00:30:46.876 --> 00:30:48.550
all of these tools.

00:30:48.550 --> 00:30:52.850
As Socrates once said,
"I know that I know nothing."

00:30:53.940 --> 00:30:59.150
Start small with understanding how
your users behave, what they use.

00:30:59.150 --> 00:31:00.420
Test out this technology.

00:31:00.420 --> 00:31:02.060
Is it working properly?

00:31:02.060 --> 00:31:06.120
Find out where the traps and the
pitfalls on your website, fix them.

00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:09.850
Now why you have to fix
them, which tools exist,

00:31:09.850 --> 00:31:14.090
and where I can find them and
access them when I need them.

00:31:14.090 --> 00:31:16.940
From that point on, it's all
going step by step at the time.

00:31:18.410 --> 00:31:22.690
Some developers may say that
the effort does not pay out

00:31:22.690 --> 00:31:28.000
and that there will still be
a job for current experience

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:29.960
and the set of skills they have.

00:31:31.910 --> 00:31:34.700
My message to them,
if there are any of them,

00:31:34.700 --> 00:31:36.960
is that the very
moment you are unable

00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:40.430
to improve yourself is the
moment you should stop working

00:31:40.430 --> 00:31:41.430
as a website designer.

00:31:43.070 --> 00:31:45.450
If you think that it is
too late for you, note that

00:31:45.450 --> 00:31:49.580
just by making effort to learn
about website accessibility

00:31:49.580 --> 00:31:56.650
just by reasoning to this lecture,
you are getting one step ahead

00:31:56.650 --> 00:31:57.710
of most of your competitors.

00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:08.390
Now the final topic is about nuance
for accessibility test tools.

00:32:09.950 --> 00:32:13.080
One of the traps that is
probably the easiest to fall in.

00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:18.110
We need this false sense of
security, and by nature,

00:32:18.110 --> 00:32:23.030
we need to create checkboxes
and get the maximum scores.

00:32:23.030 --> 00:32:27.090
We can have perfect scores and have
a completely inaccessible website.

00:32:28.150 --> 00:32:32.520
Also, we can get this false sense
of security by just making sure

00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:36.960
that we reach ADA compliance
or another form of compliance

00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:38.890
with local legislation.

00:32:38.890 --> 00:32:41.084
Once again,
it is important to remember

00:32:41.085 --> 00:32:44.670
that there is a huge difference
between theory and practice.

00:32:44.670 --> 00:32:47.750
If we do not collect
feedback from end users,

00:32:47.750 --> 00:32:50.410
we cannot classify
specific website access.

00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:56.000
Now if you have ever worked
on website optimization,

00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:00.400
and I assume most of the
developers did, then you know

00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:04.640
that having a perfect optimization
score does not make a website pass.

00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:07.980
Accessibility tools can work.

00:33:09.030 --> 00:33:14.380
You need to know how they work,
so you could understand the results.

00:33:14.380 --> 00:33:18.940
Most importantly,
using feedback has no alternative.

00:33:20.700 --> 00:33:22.890
Okay, guys,
let's see this in practice.

00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:32.250
Now let me just open my browser so
that we could test out a website

00:33:32.250 --> 00:33:35.647
using a known accessibility tool.

00:33:35.647 --> 00:33:46.191
[pause ]

00:33:46.992 --> 00:33:48.250
Can everybody see my browser?

00:33:50.243 --> 00:33:50.753
Good.

00:34:03.070 --> 00:34:12.930
Now, we are going to see a
website of a local airport,

00:34:12.930 --> 00:34:20.800
which of course, once you
access, you can book your flight,

00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:21.830
reserve your tickets.

00:34:23.060 --> 00:34:26.270
In any case, Lazar specifically
told me for this website

00:34:26.270 --> 00:34:32.170
that this website is inaccessible
and that he had serious issues

00:34:32.170 --> 00:34:33.170
in booking his part.

00:34:34.580 --> 00:34:45.740
Now let's use a common accessibility
test tool such as Wave.

00:34:55.620 --> 00:34:58.650
We are going to test the
website with Wave tool.

00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:08.400
Oh interesting.

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:14.810
We can see that this
web has three errors.

00:35:17.160 --> 00:35:19.070
Let's try testing another website.

00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:34.260
Let's see a website that
Lazar told me that has lots

00:35:34.260 --> 00:35:39.610
of accessibility features and
that he can easily navigate.

00:35:57.110 --> 00:36:00.090
How many errors do you think
this website would have?

00:36:00.090 --> 00:36:01.200
Probably, zero, right?

00:36:02.780 --> 00:36:04.780
Wrong [chuckles]

00:36:04.780 --> 00:36:05.780
Can you see this?

00:36:06.580 --> 00:36:08.020
Let's now compare.

00:36:08.020 --> 00:36:12.242
We have three errors,
33 contrast errors,

00:36:12.243 --> 00:36:15.560
27 words, 29 feets, 18 elements.

00:36:19.332 --> 00:36:23.857
Look at this,
from this you could imagine

00:36:23.858 --> 00:36:28.670
that Air Serbia is more accessible
than Blind Health Project, a website

00:36:28.670 --> 00:36:32.090
which is perfectly accessible
for screen reader uses.

00:36:34.530 --> 00:36:39.540
Here is where I mentioned that
accessibility tools do what.

00:36:41.240 --> 00:36:47.710
First of all, not all of this
information refers to accessibility

00:36:47.710 --> 00:36:49.230
for screen reader users.

00:36:49.230 --> 00:36:54.850
It can refer to contest issues,
it can refer to dynamic content,

00:36:54.850 --> 00:36:56.550
which is blocking the view.

00:36:58.350 --> 00:37:01.640
It does not necessarily
target all users.

00:37:03.990 --> 00:37:10.400
Next of all,
do you see an issue here?

00:37:12.540 --> 00:37:13.990
What basically happened here?

00:37:17.010 --> 00:37:22.090
If you noticed when we initially
visited the Air Serbia website,

00:37:22.090 --> 00:37:26.590
a DDoS check five so that it
could verify that we're not good

00:37:26.590 --> 00:37:30.050
for using their website or
causing an attack on it.

00:37:32.640 --> 00:37:38.550
This check filed also when we tested
the website using the Wave tool.

00:37:38.550 --> 00:37:42.230
In a, let's say,
small-scale practice,

00:37:43.361 --> 00:37:45.060
you will see DDoS check filed

00:37:45.060 --> 00:37:48.860
when website has Cloudflare,
which is probably one

00:37:48.860 --> 00:37:52.710
of most famous features
of Cloudflare CDN.

00:37:55.040 --> 00:37:57.630
What happens with DDoS check files?

00:37:57.630 --> 00:38:05.480
Most of test tools are a big tricked,
and they cannot see entire content

00:38:05.480 --> 00:38:08.570
of the website, but trust the
window that shows the DDoS track.

00:38:09.950 --> 00:38:15.970
What then happens, DDoS track
will cover all the content,

00:38:15.970 --> 00:38:22.310
and accessibility tool will affect
the code just to the visible content,

00:38:22.310 --> 00:38:24.430
which is the DDoS track.

00:38:24.430 --> 00:38:28.580
You can't couple of words of text,
or in this case you have an error.

00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:36.290
In any case, you will have
very limited information,

00:38:36.290 --> 00:38:40.590
and this information is
not valued for testing.

00:38:40.590 --> 00:38:45.650
What you can do to test
a website properly is

00:38:45.650 --> 00:38:54.810
that there is also a Wave browsing
extension, which you can click

00:38:54.810 --> 00:38:57.420
and file once web
website is ordered.

00:38:58.600 --> 00:39:03.420
In that case you will get
obviously much different results.

00:39:08.730 --> 00:39:15.980
Now let's get back to the topic.

00:39:15.980 --> 00:39:19.580
It is important and
essential for you to know

00:39:19.580 --> 00:39:30.010
that us developers are empowered
to rationally use our knowledge,

00:39:30.393 --> 00:39:37.300
and we need to have integrity.

00:39:37.300 --> 00:39:41.940
We need to understand
that focusing on majority

00:39:41.940 --> 00:39:49.680
of users will make lots of
people have closed doors

00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:55.540
or have troubles, even using
the products that you created

00:39:55.540 --> 00:39:58.040
for ourselves or your clients.

00:39:58.040 --> 00:40:06.460
Now it is our duty together, spread
the world, and show to the world

00:40:06.460 --> 00:40:11.590
that we can step-by-step make
this world more accessible.

00:40:11.590 --> 00:40:12.590
Thank you.

00:40:18.550 --> 00:40:21.999
>> DANIELLE: Thank you so
much for all of that info.

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:25.740
As a reminder to people watching,
you can enter your questions

00:40:25.740 --> 00:40:28.640
in the Q&A tab next
to the Live stream.

00:40:31.850 --> 00:40:35.010
I think one of the
questions I had is

00:40:36.710 --> 00:40:43.850
what would make you report an
issue versus leaving a website

00:40:43.850 --> 00:40:44.800
and never coming back?

00:40:46.678 --> 00:40:48.510
>> LAZAR: It's probably for me.

00:40:48.510 --> 00:40:49.681
>> DANIELLE: Yes.

00:40:52.016 --> 00:40:53.309
>> LAZAR: I'll be honest with you.

00:40:55.990 --> 00:41:00.070
I never reported any ship
to the developers or company

00:41:01.110 --> 00:41:06.540
because according to my
experience with certain people

00:41:06.540 --> 00:41:12.780
who actually did the same,
there was no any change.

00:41:14.070 --> 00:41:16.330
It depends.

00:41:16.330 --> 00:41:22.070
Sometimes if the thing is critically
important for me, I then ask

00:41:22.070 --> 00:41:23.280
for a psyched help.

00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:28.190
For example, in this case
of opening a bank account,

00:41:28.190 --> 00:41:31.340
I could easily switch to
another bank, and that's it.

00:41:31.340 --> 00:41:36.990
Sometimes it's not that
easy to replace the vendor,

00:41:36.990 --> 00:41:40.600
so you must do things that you can.

00:41:42.840 --> 00:41:46.140
He actually had
some certain things.

00:41:46.140 --> 00:41:53.210
I actually did report the
accessibility issues but,

00:41:54.450 --> 00:41:57.970
on certain software,
it was not related to the web.

00:42:00.240 --> 00:42:03.310
I think I did it for
three or four times,

00:42:03.310 --> 00:42:08.600
and only once they
changed the thing.

00:42:09.830 --> 00:42:11.000
Actually, I told you.

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:15.066
Based on the importance
and significance,

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:19.450
I choose either to go on

00:42:19.450 --> 00:42:22.160
and ask for assistance
or choose to give up.

00:42:24.008 --> 00:42:24.840
>> DANIELLE: Makes sense.

00:42:26.270 --> 00:42:30.650
To either one of you, how do you
approach telling people about

00:42:30.650 --> 00:42:31.870
how to fix their websites?

00:42:31.870 --> 00:42:37.770
When you're auditing the
site or reviewing the site,

00:42:37.770 --> 00:42:39.560
how do you present
the info to them?

00:42:39.560 --> 00:42:43.700
Is it in a video of
you reviewing the site?

00:42:43.700 --> 00:42:45.960
Is it in some printed document?

00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:49.310
How do you present this info to
the people who you're auditing for

00:42:53.930 --> 00:42:54.850
if you do at all?

00:43:01.640 --> 00:43:04.500
>> LAZAR: I'll tell you
honestly, my idea is

00:43:04.500 --> 00:43:10.610
to become an accessibility tester and
to start a career as a consultant.

00:43:10.610 --> 00:43:11.610
Why not?

00:43:12.100 --> 00:43:14.880
I do provide those services.

00:43:14.880 --> 00:43:18.540
So far, I did it via Zoom
calls and then video.

00:43:19.640 --> 00:43:23.300
I most likely share the
screen and tell what's wrong

00:43:23.300 --> 00:43:24.460
and what should be fixed.

00:43:25.930 --> 00:43:30.950
This was the way I used to do
it, but if some people

00:43:30.950 --> 00:43:35.870
or clients have some different--
how to say, wishes, desires,

00:43:35.870 --> 00:43:39.910
so maybe they want to have
all documented or screen

00:43:39.910 --> 00:43:46.090
and audio recorded, I'll be more
than happy to provide this as well.

00:43:49.610 --> 00:43:51.820
>> ANDRIJA: I can only add to that.

00:43:53.170 --> 00:43:57.540
I'm obviously not providing
that service as a service.

00:43:57.540 --> 00:44:03.940
However,
if I need to help a developer

00:44:03.941 --> 00:44:06.240
make something more accessible,

00:44:06.240 --> 00:44:13.190
I will give him a basic set of
tools, and I will inspect the code,

00:44:13.190 --> 00:44:15.140
which is present on the website.

00:44:16.930 --> 00:44:21.840
Then I will create the list of
all the issues with the structure

00:44:21.840 --> 00:44:24.150
of the web website.

00:44:24.150 --> 00:44:30.140
Of course, this is just the
list of structural issues.

00:44:30.140 --> 00:44:35.150
This is not the actual
accessibility test of the website.

00:44:35.150 --> 00:44:39.830
I'm giving them indication, 'Hey,
guys, you are using wrong governments

00:44:39.830 --> 00:44:40.820
for this.

00:44:40.820 --> 00:44:43.280
You're basically
asking for trouble.

00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:44.960
Please use these elements instead."

00:44:44.960 --> 00:44:49.100
Or, "Please try this
solution or that source."

00:44:49.100 --> 00:44:50.354
That's my answer to that.

00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:58.580
>> DANIELLE: I think to leave
us with one final thought.

00:44:58.580 --> 00:45:01.810
You guys both had really
awesome takeaways,

00:45:01.810 --> 00:45:08.180
and there were so many things,
messages for developers and people

00:45:08.180 --> 00:45:10.170
who have their websites.

00:45:10.170 --> 00:45:12.620
If you had one thing
to say to somebody,

00:45:13.790 --> 00:45:18.700
if they didn't take away anything
at all, give them one thing

00:45:18.700 --> 00:45:22.170
from each of you,
what would that be?

00:45:31.929 --> 00:45:33.080
>> LAZAR: Andrija, maybe you can--

00:45:37.635 --> 00:45:43.070
>> ANDRIJA: If there was one thing
that I would say is basically,

00:45:43.070 --> 00:45:44.270
don't be afraid.

00:45:44.270 --> 00:45:50.380
Just learn, dive into the
topic, and realize

00:45:50.380 --> 00:45:53.440
that we have a great
responsibility in our hands.

00:45:54.840 --> 00:46:02.980
It is our mission to make sure
that online presence is accessible

00:46:02.980 --> 00:46:03.560
to anyone.

00:46:05.363 --> 00:46:07.910
>> LAZAR: I would say start small.

00:46:09.540 --> 00:46:12.560
Small steps are crucial here.

00:46:12.560 --> 00:46:17.490
You don't have to make the entire
website accessible at once,

00:46:17.490 --> 00:46:19.040
just tiny steps.

00:46:20.810 --> 00:46:24.200
Do whatever you can
little by little.

00:46:24.200 --> 00:46:27.590
Follow the latest trends,
dedicate yourself.

00:46:27.590 --> 00:46:29.240
It's not rocket science.

00:46:29.240 --> 00:46:30.240
It's not hard.

00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:31.822
[chuckles]

00:46:31.822 --> 00:46:37.070
Everything will be accessible
shortly, but please just start.

00:46:37.070 --> 00:46:39.420
That would be one word so start.

00:46:39.420 --> 00:46:40.340
>> DANIELLE: I love that.

00:46:40.340 --> 00:46:41.300
I love both of those.

00:46:41.300 --> 00:46:43.140
Those are so important.

00:46:43.140 --> 00:46:45.920
It looks like we have
a question submission.

00:46:47.280 --> 00:46:50.930
What is important to you when
doing an accessibility test?

00:46:50.930 --> 00:46:55.100
What should the people inquiring
for the test think about?

00:46:55.100 --> 00:46:57.400
I think you covered
this a little bit.

00:46:57.400 --> 00:47:00.320
When somebody's going into a test,
what should they be keeping in mind?

00:47:07.925 --> 00:47:11.670
>> LAZAR: I'm talking from a
screen reader user perspective.

00:47:11.670 --> 00:47:13.560
Headings are very important.

00:47:14.700 --> 00:47:18.940
All added fields should be labeled.

00:47:18.940 --> 00:47:25.119
Combo boxes,
checkboxes that all pictures,

00:47:25.120 --> 00:47:29.430
graphics all text is included

00:47:29.430 --> 00:47:31.170
to all pictures and images.

00:47:33.040 --> 00:47:34.400
Buttons.

00:47:34.400 --> 00:47:35.120
That's important.

00:47:35.120 --> 00:47:38.860
It depends on what the
site is presenting.

00:47:41.750 --> 00:47:47.160
Andrija sometimes said like, "Try to
imagine that your website is a book.

00:47:47.160 --> 00:47:49.350
It's like chapters.

00:47:49.350 --> 00:47:54.740
Do your best to make it readily
early available to all people

00:47:54.740 --> 00:47:56.930
so people can read it easily."

00:47:59.110 --> 00:48:03.816
>> ANDRIJA: I would just like
to add that the information

00:48:03.840 --> 00:48:06.650
that is presented to
a screen reader user

00:48:07.940 --> 00:48:13.380
if accessibility is not done right,
can very often be overwhelming.

00:48:15.450 --> 00:48:20.070
If a website is showing
an access of information

00:48:20.070 --> 00:48:23.490
to the screen reader
user, then the interaction

00:48:23.490 --> 00:48:24.960
with the website will be slow.

00:48:27.703 --> 00:48:32.792
By that, they will know
I had to spend more time

00:48:32.793 --> 00:48:34.710
to purchase this product.

00:48:34.710 --> 00:48:36.110
I could go to that store.

00:48:37.480 --> 00:48:40.970
The process would take five
minutes, 10 minutes.

00:48:42.630 --> 00:48:43.800
Time is of the essence.

00:48:45.360 --> 00:48:49.270
Try to focus on what's important.

00:48:49.270 --> 00:48:55.170
Whatever can be distracting should
not be read by a screen reader.

00:48:56.430 --> 00:49:02.130
You need to think about how
you will design a website.

00:49:03.690 --> 00:49:05.730
You need to focus on the basics.

00:49:05.730 --> 00:49:10.450
If website is able to
serve its basic function.

00:49:10.450 --> 00:49:15.320
If you can make a
purchase of the website,

00:49:16.380 --> 00:49:21.470
then the website serves
its basic purpose.

00:49:21.470 --> 00:49:26.010
Then you can focus on other things.

00:49:26.010 --> 00:49:30.230
If you cannot make a purpose, if
there is an issue that prevents it,

00:49:31.720 --> 00:49:36.660
you could have spent
months testing a website,

00:49:36.660 --> 00:49:40.640
making sure it is accessible,
but if it has that critical favor

00:49:40.640 --> 00:49:43.116
that screen reader user
cannot purchase it,

00:49:43.117 --> 00:49:45.310
basically,
all that testing is in way.

00:49:47.575 --> 00:49:49.940
>> DANIELLE: If it doesn't
work, then it can be as pretty

00:49:49.940 --> 00:49:52.650
as it can be,
but it won't do anything.

00:49:52.650 --> 00:49:54.470
>> ANDRIJA: Exactly.

00:49:54.470 --> 00:49:57.290
>> DANIELLE: Thank you both so
much, and thanks

00:49:57.290 --> 00:50:00.550
for attending this session
with Andrija and Lazar.

00:50:00.550 --> 00:50:03.560
You can continue the
conversation in the chat

00:50:03.560 --> 00:50:14.080
or on social media using
#WPA11Y day and #WPAD 2022.

00:50:14.080 --> 00:50:18.760
We also appreciate it if you go

00:50:18.760 --> 00:50:24.640
to provide anonymous feedback for
our speakers on their presentation.

00:50:24.640 --> 00:50:27.430
We're going to have you stay
tuned for accessibility testing

00:50:27.430 --> 00:50:30.240
in the CI/CD process.

00:50:31.650 --> 00:50:35.580
This current session is
the last one of this block.

00:50:35.580 --> 00:50:37.160
When you come back,
you're going to need

00:50:37.160 --> 00:50:40.460
to refresh the live stream page
to switch to the next stream.

00:50:41.620 --> 00:50:46.690
It's coming up at 9:00 AM
UTC and 4:00 AM Central.

00:50:46.690 --> 00:50:50.180
