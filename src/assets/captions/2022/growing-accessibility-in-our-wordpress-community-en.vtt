[silence]

00:00:30.731 --> 00:00:34.090
<v Abbas Jaffary>Welcome, everybody
to WordPress Accessibility Day.

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:35.670
My name is Abbas Jaffary.

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.400
I'm a mathematics teacher
and tutor and I focus

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.090
on getting mathematics
more accessible on the web.

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.150
Today, right now we have a
session, a panel discussion

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:48.830
called Growing Accessibility
in Our WordPress Community.

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:53.520
Our speakers are Sumner Davenport,
a specialty in Web Accessibility

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.280
at Sumner M Davenport
and Associates.

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.480
Alicia St. Rose,
the owner at WordPress with Heart.

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.490
Joe A Simpson Jr,
digital communications administrator

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:06.730
for the Los Angeles Metro.

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:10.040
Ron Amick, a web developer
with Lucky Cat Creative,

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.570
and Sally Thoun,
owner and head of US Partnerships

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.390
for Sa11y Gurl Digital Accessibility
and Marketing, AAAtraq.

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.010
I want to welcome all of
our speakers, and I'd like

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:25.490
to welcome everybody to add questions
in the Q&A tab in slideshow,

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.580
and the panelists will answer
them throughout the session.

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.620
Please use the ideas section
to chat with other attendees.

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:36.180
Welcome everyone and with that,
I will turn it over to our panelists.

00:01:38.732 --> 00:01:39.540
<v Joe Simpson> What is community?

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.110
For those of us in the WordPress
community, community is family,

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:56.470
an environment for others
to learn and grow, a place

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:58.640
where we celebrate
everyone's achievements.

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:01.500
I'm going to change the
presentation's title

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.230
from Growing WordPress
Accessibility in our Community

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:08.260
to what it should be.

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.560
Her story, growing WordPress
accessibility in your community.

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:22.680
<v Meryl Evans> That's how I learn.

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.350
That's how I learn about you.

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:25.710
That's how I connect with you.

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:27.740
That's how I met with you.

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:33.330
Video calls and these meetups
were a much more effective way

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.130
for me to be a part
of the community.

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:39.580
That's going to help
me, it gave me that

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:43.620
when I was just ramping trying
to figure out what's real.

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:49.030
Now, I am a tactical marketing
consultant and speaker.

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:56.260
It was one of the things
that propelled me.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:01.510
It was the perfect storm at work
and she was one of those things.

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:06.540
Because I love how she thinks
about accessibility as a whole

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.130
and not just specific parts.

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:10.740
That's what I try to do.

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:14.460
I don't just focus on passion
and making sure the deaf

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:16.740
and hard-of-hearing
people can access them.

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:22.210
I want everybody to have access just
like Sumner, we share that in common.

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:26.180
What I love about her
is she shares her story.

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:31.080
It's one of the ways that I
share a lot and I will credit her

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:32.990
because it's such a powerful story.

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:41.790
So many times, I don't have
disabled people in my audience,

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:45.170
I don't need to worry
about accessibility right?

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.890
She tells a story about how a
client she was working with him

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:55.320
on the colors of a website
and he picked colors

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:58.640
that were not very accessible.

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.830
She said, "Why don't we
take it around the office

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:03.460
and get everybody's
thoughts on them?"

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:04.820
<v Joe> Oh that was a great story.

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:07.050
<v Meryl> Yes,
you remember that story?

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:12.220
Then she takes it to the
client's partner's office,

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:16.400
and the partner says, "Don't
bother showing me, I'm colorblind."

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:21.420
That just blows my mind because
the guy didn't even know

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:25.180
that the partner was color-blind
and he couldn't locate

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.950
the important accessibility.

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:33.130
The important people you
know may have disabilities

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:35.790
and you just don't know them.

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:39.160
Those many disabilities
are not apparent.

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:44.440
Yes, you are most likely going
to have people with disabilities

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:48.180
in your audience and maybe we'll
come right next door with you.

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:50.800
Okay.

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:54.220
I never made videos for many years.

00:04:54.220 --> 00:05:00.590
I am a macro tech career,
and I knew the importance of video,

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:05.350
and I didn't make a video for you
because I know I was blunt out,

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:08.010
still, I have an accent
that comes with it.

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:12.020
I just didn't know how people
would receive my accent

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:15.220
because I understand if someone
would struggle with that

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:17.540
or it doesn't sound good.

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:19.640
I'm realistic.

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:21.030
I understand.

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:24.140
When I started making videos
that worked with captions.

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:26.280
People were wonderful about it.

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:32.040
Then that app that you were
banned was my second ban

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:36.300
that you the first one was the year
before, but it was a small one.

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:39.850
That was the first pro
class that I taught.

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:48.160
The fact that Sumner invited me
to pack a bag made me feel good

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:54.470
because it showed she liked
my speaking, she saw value

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:56.360
in what I had to offer.

00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:00.690
That was the start of my
speaking career pretty much.

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:06.780
Her inviting me was just the
first step and then pretty soon,

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:08.550
I was getting more invitation.

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:14.660
Now I've done a TEDx Talk and I
don't think that would have happened

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:19.740
without those little nudges along
the way, like Sumner inviting me

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:20.740
to her group.

00:06:27.949 --> 00:06:28.902
<v Paul> Yes, I'm Paul.

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:33.410
I'm a graduate student
doing research.

00:06:36.026 --> 00:06:37.513
My research actually focused

00:06:37.513 --> 00:06:43.450
on accessibility doing
computer research, basically.

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:49.880
My major is computer science
and my cousin is doing

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:54.390
his software engineering so we're
basically trying to do research

00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:57.425
on how to build tools

00:06:57.425 --> 00:07:03.240
to automatically detect accessibility
issues in web applications.

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:12.510
I met Sumner last year,
during the AIR Competition.

00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:17.790
I joined AIR last minute,
and it was at 9:13.

00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:22.970
Then, we were working
before kind of short-handed.

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:27.110
We had Sumner as a mentor.

00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:31.070
She's really powerful.

00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:36.690
She was our mentor for the thing.

00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:47.770
One thing that I remember the most
is we didn't overreach, either.

00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:52.490
Visual stream readers
would work on our site

00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:58.650
and there's something there
that they never struck in yours,

00:07:58.650 --> 00:08:02.480
they get in my head,
I'm always like Sumner mentioned

00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:06.030
how media just put forth
differences, depending

00:08:06.030 --> 00:08:08.810
on the environment
user environment.

00:08:08.810 --> 00:08:11.710
I was like, "Wow,
that kind of setup.

00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:17.350
You wouldn't know unless
you VP on it for a while."

00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:20.320
Now we like the high-level stuff.

00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:23.180
She's like a girl with a
logo for implementation.

00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:30.560
As well, I remember one time we were
implementing this navigation bar

00:08:31.610 --> 00:08:35.280
on the top of the website,
and there's a search button.

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:41.813
There's a search spot and
we're excited to talk about how

00:08:41.813 --> 00:08:42.756
to label it.

00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:50.270
She just pulls out that exact
WPC like, "Here's an example

00:08:50.270 --> 00:08:52.310
of how you can do it."

00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:54.440
Yes, there's no
limit, like you said.

00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:59.500
<v Jennifer> Hi, I'm Jennifer
and I have long black hair.

00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:02.500
I want to believe I
have these diverse eyes.

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:06.430
I'm wearing a red t-shirt
with a purple pull over

00:09:06.430 --> 00:09:07.860
and my background is blurred.

00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:09.350
How did I meet Sumner?

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:15.250
Definitely, the very first WordCamp
Santa Clarita Valley organized

00:09:15.250 --> 00:09:16.250
by you, Joe.

00:09:18.250 --> 00:09:23.160
I was so new to making websites,
I'm still relatively new.

00:09:24.310 --> 00:09:28.200
To the WordPress Community WordCamp,
that was my very first WordCamp.

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:30.760
I had met you like two weeks
before and you invited me

00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:32.450
and I was like, "What is this?

00:09:32.450 --> 00:09:34.240
This is awesome."

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:39.940
I had not heard about
web accessibility at all.

00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:41.750
I was so dang new.

00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:44.970
I really lucked in attending that.

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:50.560
I know that as a woman of color,
as somebody with neuro divergence

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:54.950
who experiences and organizes
information differently than a lot

00:09:54.950 --> 00:10:01.060
of people I know the feeling
of being excluded or not

00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:07.950
being designed for, with needing
to adapt myself to be able

00:10:07.950 --> 00:10:08.950
to participate.

00:10:09.950 --> 00:10:16.370
That really affected me and just
wanted me to learn more about

00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:18.100
how this type of inclusion.

00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:23.300
I love the way Sumner presented.

00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:27.880
She broke things down, made
things really easy to understand,

00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:33.320
and also at some of her
presentations there were components

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:35.170
where we could bring
what she was sharing.

00:10:35.170 --> 00:10:39.340
We could test our own websites
and enact fixes to them.

00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:45.090
That made learning about
accessibility really empowering.

00:10:45.090 --> 00:10:47.520
I think for about a year
after that WordCamp,

00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:53.170
whenever Sumner was speaking at a
WordPress meetup in the LA area,

00:10:53.170 --> 00:10:55.260
I would get in the car and drive.

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:59.650
I remember there was a WordPress
out of Santa Clarita Valley,

00:10:59.650 --> 00:11:03.610
and a bunch of us were pretty
fired up about what we'd learned.

00:11:03.610 --> 00:11:08.390
Somehow and I think Ron
Amick was definitely there,

00:11:08.390 --> 00:11:13.960
and it was another woman,
and by the time Joe

00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:18.760
and Sumner were walking back to
their cars and somehow we got Sumner

00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:26.290
to agree to run a meet-up with us
about WordPress and accessibility.

00:11:26.290 --> 00:11:30.470
I think we were the first ones at
2019, or at least the first ones

00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:31.400
that I know about.

00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:35.710
In 2020, we had our first
meetup in the Los Angeles area

00:11:35.710 --> 00:11:37.660
at a Panera Bread.

00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:44.200
There was definitely interest and
then COVID forced all to go online.

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:47.440
So then we ended up having
a worldwide community

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:53.910
of WordPress Accessibility
learners, and from all levels,

00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:57.430
like super beginners like me to
people who have been developing

00:11:57.430 --> 00:11:59.980
for a while like Alicia St.

00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:07.030
Rose, and of course Ron Amick.

00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:11.710
Sumner brought in such incredible
speakers and educators,

00:12:13.530 --> 00:12:19.020
we would address one topic and
then learn from their perspective

00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:22.880
and also have components where we
actually brought that work learning

00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:26.340
into our own website to see
this flourishing how many people

00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:32.120
that Sumner has
inspired and mentored.

00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:38.430
I feel really lucky to be in
the community in this way.

00:12:38.430 --> 00:12:43.200
Thank you Sumner for your
tireless education and advocacy,

00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:47.050
we feel really blessed to
have you in our community.

00:12:53.173 --> 00:12:56.110
<v Sally Thoun> I was mentioning
to one of my girlfriends

00:12:56.110 --> 00:13:00.020
who has a digital marketing
agency as well about accessibility

00:13:00.020 --> 00:13:01.990
and she said she was
going to start selling it.

00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:04.980
I'm like, "Oh,
how are you going to do that?"

00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:07.490
Because I knew she didn't really
know much, and she was going

00:13:07.490 --> 00:13:10.920
to sell an overlay, and I was
like, "Oh my goodness."

00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:12.330
I was still too new.

00:13:12.330 --> 00:13:15.040
So I went back to
Sumner and she armed me

00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:19.900
with all the positive ammunition
that I needed to educate my friend,

00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:25.350
Karen, on the real way to sell
accessibility and not with shortcuts,

00:13:25.350 --> 00:13:31.590
and Karen trusted me, believed in
me, canceled her account,

00:13:31.590 --> 00:13:36.430
and when I had posted that in our
Slack group, Sumner said to me

00:13:36.430 --> 00:13:39.560
that you truly are a real
accessibility champion.

00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:43.370
It just touched me.

00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:56.980
<v Ron Amick> In that chaos in
the churn that has been happening,

00:13:56.980 --> 00:14:01.980
there is Sumner as the calm
that holds up the roof,

00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:11.140
the calm and the storm the reasonable
voice, and she's consistent

00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:17.030
and she never lets down her fire.

00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:21.340
She's always got the fire burning
for making accessibility happen,

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:28.220
she has to control herself
sometimes because she gets

00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:31.910
a little too emotional
in some cases.

00:14:34.890 --> 00:14:39.470
With regard to overlays and
overlay companies in particular.

00:14:42.670 --> 00:14:50.620
She is an amazing influence over
so many a huge range of developers,

00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:53.970
designers, and users of
WordPress and beyond WordPress.

00:14:55.980 --> 00:15:00.300
My professional work with her
has been as a co-developer

00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:04.070
of an accessibility
meetup, which began

00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:11.650
as a WordPress San Fernando
Valley meetup in 2020 at the dawn

00:15:11.650 --> 00:15:15.390
of the COVID problems.

00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:23.970
We only had one in-person
meetup and it was a great series

00:15:23.970 --> 00:15:25.120
that was all Sumner.

00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:30.470
Sumner thought, "Oh,
let's find someone who's blind."

00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:33.210
Because everyone thinks that's
the first thing people think

00:15:33.210 --> 00:15:40.330
of is blind people, and we got
the amazing Anthony Vasquez

00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:42.760
and he came in.

00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:52.360
From there we went on to every
other major area of accessibility,

00:15:55.550 --> 00:16:02.250
and I was along in the front-row
seat to learn from her.

00:16:08.878 --> 00:16:11.636
<v Alicia St. Rose> It went online,
obviously all the other ones

00:16:11.637 --> 00:16:16.290
during COVID, and I believe it might
have been maybe the third meetup,

00:16:16.290 --> 00:16:22.200
it felt like it was in March or
April, that I had the meetup,

00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:26.780
and one woman showed up and I
believe she was the only person

00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:29.070
that showed up that night because
I was just getting it rolling.

00:16:30.110 --> 00:16:35.030
This beautiful redhead that shows
up, and she is like--

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:38.780
I know she means business
because the way she's answering

00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:42.650
and talking is just
really, really serious

00:16:42.650 --> 00:16:45.090
and passionate about
this accessibility thing.

00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:52.830
I had been exposed to
accessibility and in my viewpoint,

00:16:52.830 --> 00:16:55.350
it was only for
people who were blind.

00:16:55.350 --> 00:16:58.610
I think most people have that
misconception that it's for people

00:16:58.610 --> 00:17:01.720
who can't see the web,
but there's so much more to it.

00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:07.120
That night, my basic stuff
was, "Make sure people can read

00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:10.560
what's on the website,
like your text and everything."

00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:14.710
She started talking about
what I called overlays,

00:17:14.710 --> 00:17:17.530
which I had never actually
heard that term used before.

00:17:20.230 --> 00:17:24.570
When she kept describing and
talking about this, I realized

00:17:24.570 --> 00:17:29.500
that I had secretly unbeknownst to
my client, put one on his website

00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:33.220
and I thought it was the coolest
thing ever, and I was just like,

00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:37.190
"Oh my God, this thing slides out and
people can do whatever they want."

00:17:37.190 --> 00:17:41.170
As she's talking about it, saying
that when that thing slides out

00:17:41.170 --> 00:17:46.190
in a lot of cases, not all
100%, but a lot of cases,

00:17:46.190 --> 00:17:51.310
in most cases, it actually gets in
the way and it flags down people

00:17:51.310 --> 00:17:55.410
to maybe look more at your website
to see if it's really accessible

00:17:55.410 --> 00:17:59.780
without that thing, because
really it should be without it.

00:17:59.780 --> 00:18:04.910
While she's talking about this,
I sneaked away and literally logged

00:18:04.910 --> 00:18:09.330
into my client's site and
I was like deactivate.

00:18:09.330 --> 00:18:12.870
I deleted that thing,
and that was the first

00:18:12.870 --> 00:18:16.190
and last overlay I ever put on
a website, and I am so thankful

00:18:16.190 --> 00:18:21.690
that Sumner was there to
point me in that direction,

00:18:21.690 --> 00:18:27.510
and in the midst of that, I started
realizing there was really more

00:18:27.510 --> 00:18:33.740
to this than a putting
some plugin on, also more

00:18:33.740 --> 00:18:37.050
to, you can't see the website.

00:18:37.050 --> 00:18:44.470
I'm the person that if I
know that there's now an area

00:18:44.470 --> 00:18:49.330
that is important and it actually
will make other people's lives better

00:18:49.330 --> 00:18:54.690
and I have the opportunity
to do that, then I'm all in.

00:18:54.690 --> 00:18:58.640
That night was really the night
where it turned around for me,

00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:01.100
and it was really due
to Sumner Davenport.

00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:02.430
It really was.

00:19:02.430 --> 00:19:06.890
Sumner Davenport,
you are probably one

00:19:06.890 --> 00:19:10.020
of the most influential
people I've ever come across

00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:11.650
in this WordPress community.

00:19:11.650 --> 00:19:18.510
You have literally pivoted the way
that I work and develop websites,

00:19:18.510 --> 00:19:22.020
and it's not about the
coding or the geeky part,

00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:27.840
it's about having my heart opened
to people who have diff-abilities.

00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:33.540
That's the word I want to use
because there's no disadvantage

00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:36.560
to people with abilities
that are different.

00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:41.950
I just wanted to make sure that
everything that I can provide

00:19:41.950 --> 00:19:46.470
on the web is open to anyone's
ability no matter where they are

00:19:46.470 --> 00:19:47.230
on the spectrum.

00:19:47.230 --> 00:19:51.400
I want to thank you so
wholeheartedly for that night

00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:58.510
when a moment a light bulb went
on and it has only gotten brighter

00:19:58.510 --> 00:19:59.540
and it will never dim.

00:19:59.540 --> 00:20:00.770
I want to thank you so much.

00:20:00.770 --> 00:20:03.010
I love you, and you are a
dear friend of mine now.

00:20:05.438 --> 00:20:06.240
<v Joe> Wow.

00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:09.780
Sumner is so incredible.

00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:13.090
Now, you can see why she's
meant so much to our community

00:20:13.090 --> 00:20:14.380
in terms of accessibility.

00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:17.290
Here are some other things
that we were working on

00:20:17.290 --> 00:20:19.890
in the past five
years as a community.

00:20:19.890 --> 00:20:24.930
We had two teams participate in
the Knowbility AIR competition

00:20:24.930 --> 00:20:29.150
where we built client
sites for nonprofits.

00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:33.290
The incredible thing about that
competition was that we had to work

00:20:33.290 --> 00:20:38.340
with WCAG guidelines and apply them
to specific areas of our website,

00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:39.340
which was pretty awesome.

00:20:40.790 --> 00:20:46.640
As mentioned at the top, we celebrate
everything that our community does.

00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:49.310
We're all connected on social media,
and whenever something happens,

00:20:49.310 --> 00:20:55.810
whenever we speak or get a new
job, or get some training,

00:20:55.810 --> 00:20:58.090
we share it with each other
and we congratulate each other.

00:21:00.210 --> 00:21:05.190
Also, in the lead-up to WordPress
Accessibility Day, two years ago,

00:21:05.190 --> 00:21:08.540
we did a mega meetup where we
had speakers in and simulated

00:21:08.540 --> 00:21:11.690
what people would get on
WordPress Accessibility Day.

00:21:11.690 --> 00:21:15.300
We were one of the first and
only WordCamps to have not one,

00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:22.960
two, or three speakers as most
camps do, but we had 16 speakers

00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:26.430
in a dedicated track on both
days at WordCamp Santa Clarita,

00:21:26.430 --> 00:21:27.430
which was a first.

00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:33.310
Go to a meetup.

00:21:33.310 --> 00:21:39.070
You can go to the IAAP page and
the events tab and find a number

00:21:39.070 --> 00:21:42.080
of different meetups
focusing on accessibility,

00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:46.170
not just WordPress Accessibility,
but general accessibility topics

00:21:46.170 --> 00:21:47.190
all across the country.

00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:55.140
Here are also some resources
on how to contribute

00:21:55.140 --> 00:21:58.940
to WordPress Accessibility on
the Make WordPress channel.

00:21:58.940 --> 00:22:02.520
Just click on the accessibility
box and you'll find out about

00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:09.530
when the next meeting is, the next
bug scrub, and how to get involved.

00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:15.410
Now, time for our panel.

00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:21.460
Alicia St. Rose, Ron Amick,
Sally Thoun, and Sumner Davenport.

00:22:30.170 --> 00:22:32.160
You don't have to see
the whole staircase.

00:22:33.170 --> 00:22:34.860
Just take the first step.

00:22:35.940 --> 00:22:40.010
It was a typical California winter
evening and I was driving down

00:22:40.010 --> 00:22:41.430
to West Hill to see a speaker.

00:22:43.430 --> 00:22:46.950
I had heard that there was this
incredible accessibility speaker

00:22:46.950 --> 00:22:52.130
and for our very first WordCamp Santa
Clarita, as a former toastmaster,

00:22:52.130 --> 00:22:54.520
I was always on the
lookout for great speakers.

00:22:56.310 --> 00:22:57.630
The evening was incredible.

00:22:58.890 --> 00:23:03.400
There was this dynamic speaker,
so dynamic that the person next

00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:06.470
to me turned and punched
me in the shoulder.

00:23:06.470 --> 00:23:09.810
She said, "Ugh,
accessibility makes me so angry."

00:23:11.310 --> 00:23:12.640
That's Sumner for you.

00:23:14.610 --> 00:23:17.580
Her words are so impactful,
they make you want to act.

00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:24.970
In today's panel, I'm joined
by some of my closest friends

00:23:24.970 --> 00:23:27.550
who over the past five years,
we've done some incredible things

00:23:27.550 --> 00:23:28.350
in Santa Clarita.

00:23:28.350 --> 00:23:33.210
My hope is that when you take
in this panel when you interact

00:23:33.210 --> 00:23:35.970
with this panel, you'll leave
here today and you'll want

00:23:35.970 --> 00:23:39.890
to take that first step and take
accessibility into your work life.

00:23:42.100 --> 00:23:46.770
With that, I'm going to turn it
over to each of our panelists.

00:23:46.770 --> 00:23:50.680
First off, let's talk with Alicia.

00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:54.750
You mentioned Sumner's
impact on you.

00:23:54.750 --> 00:23:57.450
Why don't you talk a little
bit about how you've taken

00:23:57.450 --> 00:23:59.790
some of her teachings
out into your work?

00:23:59.790 --> 00:24:02.820
I know you mentioned about
taking off the overlay.

00:24:02.820 --> 00:24:06.650
There's another story where you
worked with the software manufacturer

00:24:06.650 --> 00:24:08.514
and did something pretty awesome,

00:24:11.217 --> 00:24:12.952
<v Alicia> Which
one was this story?

00:24:12.952 --> 00:24:14.420
[laughter]

00:24:14.420 --> 00:24:15.090
[crosstalk]

00:24:15.090 --> 00:24:19.320
<v Joe> I know you made a
suggestion on the chat board

00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:20.360
to make a change with-- [crosstalk]

00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:21.360
<v Alicia> Oh, got you.

00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:23.240
Yes.

00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:27.730
During the AIR rally, we were making
a website-- It was a competition

00:24:27.730 --> 00:24:30.690
to make a website as
accessible as possible.

00:24:32.350 --> 00:24:35.740
Someone on this panel has won first
place, but it was not our team.

00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:37.977
[laughs]

00:24:38.270 --> 00:24:39.270
Shout out to Sally.

00:24:40.270 --> 00:24:46.750
We used a generate press theme
for the basis that we were going

00:24:46.750 --> 00:24:49.580
to build in this
custom WordPress site.

00:24:49.580 --> 00:24:51.250
Occasionally,
I would come across something

00:24:51.250 --> 00:24:54.390
that I couldn't really
access or I didn't know

00:24:54.390 --> 00:24:57.730
how I could make it accessible
as per the guidelines

00:24:57.730 --> 00:25:00.970
that I was learning during this
rally, which is an amazing way

00:25:00.970 --> 00:25:04.619
to have some fun and
also learn accessibility

00:25:04.620 --> 00:25:06.840
almost like a crash course.

00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:10.820
Every time that I would mention
these things on their forum,

00:25:10.820 --> 00:25:13.560
I would get a response
back, "Thank you so much."

00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:16.290
In one case, they even said
they were going to add this

00:25:16.290 --> 00:25:19.770
to the documentation on how
to find the ways to do this,

00:25:19.770 --> 00:25:21.910
but they were so amenable to it.

00:25:21.910 --> 00:25:27.730
Actually, that experience
compels me to reward the people

00:25:27.730 --> 00:25:29.570
who are doing it right.

00:25:29.570 --> 00:25:32.340
There are a lot of companies
out there who care about this,

00:25:32.340 --> 00:25:36.500
and you won't know that
until you engage with them

00:25:36.500 --> 00:25:40.290
and show them something that
maybe they didn't know about.

00:25:40.290 --> 00:25:45.800
Then you'll realize that what you
don't know can't be held against you.

00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:49.280
I don't want to say it's your
responsibility to bring things

00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:53.590
to people's attention,
but it's definitely a movement

00:25:53.590 --> 00:25:56.622
in expanding this whole thing.

00:25:58.089 --> 00:25:59.280
<v Joe> Awesome.

00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:01.290
Now, I'll turn to Ron next.

00:26:01.290 --> 00:26:06.710
I know there's a story of a
famous meeting in a parking lot

00:26:06.710 --> 00:26:08.130
that turned into a meetup.

00:26:08.130 --> 00:26:12.530
Why don't you expound on, Jennifer
talked a little bit about it,

00:26:12.530 --> 00:26:17.160
how Sumner had impacted you
so much so that you decided

00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:19.480
to start a meetup on accessibility?

00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:24.240
<v Ron> It was actually
Jennifer among the three of us

00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:29.910
that were promulgating
this movement.

00:26:29.910 --> 00:26:32.040
It was Jennifer more than anyone.

00:26:33.130 --> 00:26:39.240
She turned to me and she had
been speaking with another lady

00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:43.960
who I've forgotten the name
of, I'm sorry to say.

00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:47.330
We looked over at the other--
It wasn't in the parking lot,

00:26:47.330 --> 00:26:50.960
my recollection was at the
end of your meetup, Joe.

00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:53.580
We looked over at Sumner, and she
was putting her things together

00:26:53.580 --> 00:26:57.190
on the other side of the room
and then we made our move.

00:26:57.190 --> 00:27:01.820
[laughter]

00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:05.557
I don't know why she
would be receptive

00:27:05.558 --> 00:27:10.380
to three strangers coming up to her
and saying, "Hey, would you like

00:27:10.380 --> 00:27:19.540
to spend 40 hours a month putting
a meet-up together?" She was.

00:27:19.540 --> 00:27:28.110
Sumner, as fierce an advocate as
she is for all these good things

00:27:28.110 --> 00:27:34.310
that have been mentioned is very
open and nothing phases her.

00:27:34.310 --> 00:27:42.130
She's accessible,
she's got the gift.

00:27:42.130 --> 00:27:44.760
We just went from there.

00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:51.400
It turned out, not only was she
amenable, but she was just fantastic

00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:52.320
to work with.

00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:56.950
She's on time, she's
articulate, she's so organized.

00:27:56.950 --> 00:27:58.450
She knows everything in the world.

00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:05.000
She doesn't wear it like a
lot of people in Hollywood do.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:07.530
She's a force.

00:28:07.530 --> 00:28:09.130
She's really a force of nature.

00:28:10.629 --> 00:28:12.220
<v Joe> Awesome.

00:28:12.220 --> 00:28:16.680
Sally, I'm going to turn to you
now because Alicia mentioned

00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:20.660
that someone on the team won that
wasn't technically on the team.

00:28:20.660 --> 00:28:24.560
You're our ringer because even
though you're probably the newest

00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:28.830
to the group, you've achieved
some incredible things in speaking

00:28:28.830 --> 00:28:30.620
as well as winning competitions.

00:28:30.620 --> 00:28:32.750
Why don't you talk a little
bit about that, but first,

00:28:32.750 --> 00:28:35.860
talk a little bit about how Sumner
entered the picture with you

00:28:37.050 --> 00:28:40.110
and how it ended up with
you speaking at WordCamp US.

00:28:41.943 --> 00:28:44.810
<v Sally> First of
all, hi, everyone.

00:28:44.810 --> 00:28:48.700
Get connected into a WordPress
Accessibility community

00:28:48.700 --> 00:28:51.770
because it's been the best
thing that I've ever done.

00:28:51.770 --> 00:28:54.700
These people aren't
just associates.

00:28:54.700 --> 00:28:57.000
They're really dear friends now.

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:00.420
I first met Sumner on August
8th, 2020

00:29:00.420 --> 00:29:05.410
when some of the northern Los
Angeles meetups got together

00:29:05.410 --> 00:29:07.440
and did up mega
accessibility meetup.

00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:15.670
I was hooked and I was so impressed
and just wanted to learn more.

00:29:15.670 --> 00:29:21.000
Sumner's just always there via email,
and Slack, if you have a question.

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:22.450
I'm very new to this.

00:29:22.450 --> 00:29:24.920
I've been doing digital
marketing for a while.

00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:27.450
I heard about accessibility
a few years ago.

00:29:27.450 --> 00:29:29.460
Asked my developers about it.

00:29:29.460 --> 00:29:32.480
They said it wasn't
important, wasn't necessary,

00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:34.340
but something stuck with me.

00:29:34.340 --> 00:29:38.450
On that day, my journey began
and I've attended everything.

00:29:38.450 --> 00:29:42.350
I think I've been to 120
meetups in the last two years,

00:29:42.350 --> 00:29:45.720
and I just jumped in and
volunteered where I could.

00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:49.180
I call Joe my guiding light,
he guided me where to go.

00:29:49.180 --> 00:29:54.890
WordPress Accessibility Day
2020, I wrote the blogs

00:29:54.890 --> 00:29:58.900
for the sponsors,
helped at LAX 2020 WordCamp,

00:29:58.900 --> 00:30:03.490
and then Joe did the WordCamp
Santa Clarita where I was invited

00:30:03.490 --> 00:30:04.470
to be an organizer.

00:30:04.470 --> 00:30:05.230
That was awesome.

00:30:05.230 --> 00:30:08.600
A speaker backed out last
minute and they asked me to talk

00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:12.020
about my journey and their
support and encouragement.

00:30:12.020 --> 00:30:16.190
Sumner spent hours with me
going over my presentation,

00:30:16.190 --> 00:30:17.310
helping me record it.

00:30:17.310 --> 00:30:19.770
She was just so encouraging.

00:30:19.770 --> 00:30:23.190
Then after that,
other speaking engagements came up

00:30:23.190 --> 00:30:26.670
and I'm not a developer,
I'm not a public speaker,

00:30:26.670 --> 00:30:32.000
but I wanted to just motivate people
to start their accessibility journey

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:35.620
as everyone here has and in
the accessibility community

00:30:35.620 --> 00:30:36.920
and that's what I speak about.

00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:38.620
Just take that first step.

00:30:38.620 --> 00:30:42.730
A lot of the resources shared
come from everyone in this group

00:30:42.730 --> 00:30:48.830
and I decided to apply for US
WordCamp 2022, even though I was told

00:30:48.830 --> 00:30:50.620
that first-time speakers
aren't accepted.

00:30:51.800 --> 00:30:55.980
I was accepted as a backup and
then someone had to back out.

00:30:55.980 --> 00:30:58.828
That was an amazing
experience getting

00:30:58.829 --> 00:31:01.310
to meet Alicia and Joe in person.

00:31:01.310 --> 00:31:04.550
I still can't wait to meet
Sumner and Ron and Jennifer,

00:31:04.550 --> 00:31:07.610
though I feel like I just
know you guys so well

00:31:07.610 --> 00:31:13.760
and here we are two years later at
WordPress accessibility Day 2022

00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:14.810
with you.

00:31:14.810 --> 00:31:18.240
When you follow your heart,
amazing things happen.

00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:22.680
Accessibility isn't overwhelming,
find your people to help you

00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:27.760
and support you and mentor you and
you can help make a difference.

00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:31.040
I sold my first accessible
website two weeks ago.

00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:32.760
I'm so excited.

00:31:32.760 --> 00:31:36.580
I'm working with a company
now, a nonprofit who paid a lot

00:31:36.580 --> 00:31:40.840
of money for the website and
their developers told them

00:31:40.841 --> 00:31:44.609
it was accessible because
it was built on WordPress,

00:31:44.610 --> 00:31:47.240
even though WordPress
is accessible,

00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:53.360
you still have to make additions to
it and their site is not accessible.

00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:58.810
I encourage everyone just this,
we want to include everyone

00:31:58.810 --> 00:32:00.360
and this is how we do it.

00:32:01.686 --> 00:32:02.060
<v Joe> Yes.

00:32:02.060 --> 00:32:06.010
What's so incredible and what I
really want to stress to the audience

00:32:06.010 --> 00:32:09.270
that's looking in today is that
we've all taken the message

00:32:09.270 --> 00:32:12.880
and we've all carried it off in
different directions and done a lot

00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:19.160
of different things but Sumner,
thanks so much again for allowing me

00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:22.090
to do this to embarrass
you in front of the world,

00:32:22.090 --> 00:32:26.450
but this thing,
your praises how would you say

00:32:26.450 --> 00:32:29.280
or what would you say is next
in terms of our community?

00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:32.300
Our community's done a lot of
growing in the last five years.

00:32:32.300 --> 00:32:35.320
Where would you like to see it go
or what would you like to share

00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:38.770
with the audience that's listing
in today in terms of learning

00:32:38.770 --> 00:32:39.940
or growing their community?

00:32:39.940 --> 00:32:41.450
In terms of learning accessibility.

00:32:45.796 --> 00:32:49.300
<v Sumner Davenport> You expect
me to talk after all that?

00:32:49.301 --> 00:32:50.200
[laughter]

00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:52.850
<v Joe> When the video was
playing, I was getting choked up

00:32:52.850 --> 00:32:54.982
because I just remember
when everybody was talking,

00:32:54.983 --> 00:32:57.720
there was a point when
everybody got emotional

00:32:57.721 --> 00:32:59.700
because we care so much about you

00:32:59.700 --> 00:33:03.760
and you've impacted us in
so many different ways.

00:33:05.150 --> 00:33:05.610
<v Sumner> Thank you.

00:33:05.610 --> 00:33:10.990
The feelings are mutual because
I feel that when you get involved

00:33:10.990 --> 00:33:14.563
with accessibility
for the right reasons,

00:33:15.527 --> 00:33:17.200
it is an emotional connection.

00:33:18.260 --> 00:33:24.440
I'll find my voice
here in a second.

00:33:25.450 --> 00:33:31.700
Everyone that I have had the
pleasure of speaking with,

00:33:31.700 --> 00:33:34.660
networking with, and interacting
with in these last couple

00:33:34.660 --> 00:33:40.470
of years has empowered me and
has fueled my desire to continue.

00:33:41.930 --> 00:33:47.630
Accessibility is very personal
to me and it's my passion

00:33:47.630 --> 00:33:52.580
that I know sometimes my red
hair personality gets in the way

00:33:52.580 --> 00:33:57.970
and I have to chill for a second
that maybe I'm moving too fast.

00:33:57.970 --> 00:34:00.254
Yet there's people like those here

00:34:00.255 --> 00:34:05.290
that are traveling the same speed
I am to get the message out.

00:34:05.290 --> 00:34:07.430
My suggestion is to get involved.

00:34:08.470 --> 00:34:14.030
Find the community in your
area, whether it's virtual

00:34:14.030 --> 00:34:18.910
or whether it is in real
life, even if it's only

00:34:18.910 --> 00:34:25.380
when one person shows up,
connect and move forward.

00:34:25.380 --> 00:34:29.530
If you're already working with
accessibility, find other people

00:34:29.530 --> 00:34:30.340
to work with.

00:34:30.340 --> 00:34:40.190
One of the great things that I found
when working with the AIR Project

00:34:40.190 --> 00:34:45.060
and working with Ron and
Jennifer is working with a team

00:34:45.060 --> 00:34:49.710
of people that have the same
focus and the same mission,

00:34:49.710 --> 00:34:54.820
it's exciting, it's empowering,
it will give you the fuel you need

00:34:54.820 --> 00:35:00.340
to keep going and there are a
lot of people that are great

00:35:00.340 --> 00:35:04.840
as a web designer working solo.

00:35:04.840 --> 00:35:10.530
I think my thought and feelings
are that when we find other people

00:35:10.530 --> 00:35:13.850
to work and play with on
this accessibility journey,

00:35:13.850 --> 00:35:15.870
it does make it more fun.

00:35:15.870 --> 00:35:18.250
It makes it easier and
we can reach farther.

00:35:21.120 --> 00:35:24.888
If I'm working by
myself on a website,

00:35:24.889 --> 00:35:26.690
that's one, but if I'm working

00:35:26.690 --> 00:35:30.530
with a team of people and we
each put in our area of expertise

00:35:30.530 --> 00:35:34.530
and our strength and maybe
we're working on 6 at a time

00:35:34.530 --> 00:35:38.930
or 12 at a time, that means more
websites are becoming accessible

00:35:38.930 --> 00:35:40.670
in a sooner amount of time.

00:35:43.375 --> 00:35:47.700
<v Joe> Awesome and I know,
I purposely didn't share

00:35:47.700 --> 00:35:52.530
what I'm doing because, I'm a private
person, but behind the scenes,

00:35:52.530 --> 00:35:54.612
just to share with the
audience, because again,

00:35:54.613 --> 00:35:55.740
what I really want people

00:35:55.740 --> 00:35:59.290
to do is whatever you feel
like your expression is

00:35:59.290 --> 00:36:03.460
or whatever you feel like you can
do in terms of impacting the world

00:36:03.460 --> 00:36:07.490
in terms of your
accessibility message, do it.

00:36:07.490 --> 00:36:11.270
Don't feel like if it's not
standard, don't do it.

00:36:11.270 --> 00:36:13.610
Just act, just do something.

00:36:13.610 --> 00:36:21.400
I know for me, I love to share
people that I find interesting

00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:22.760
with others in the community.

00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:26.860
I love to organize events in the
community and like I mentioned

00:36:26.860 --> 00:36:29.030
at the top, when I saw
Sumner, I was like,

00:36:29.030 --> 00:36:31.490
"People have got to
hear Sumner's message."

00:36:32.550 --> 00:36:37.890
From that point going from
WordCamps, this past year I went

00:36:37.890 --> 00:36:41.830
to WordCamp US as a team captain
and a story I wanted to share

00:36:41.830 --> 00:36:43.680
with the audience,
which was pretty awesome.

00:36:43.680 --> 00:36:48.320
Unfortunately, someone at WordCamp US
had a bad accessibility experience,

00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:52.900
and this time around I wanted
to make sure that I was

00:36:52.900 --> 00:36:55.460
on the team at the very beginning.

00:36:55.460 --> 00:36:58.960
When they toured possible
venues, I would be there.

00:36:58.960 --> 00:37:02.300
I also put together a venue
accessibility checklist

00:37:02.300 --> 00:37:05.340
and I wouldn't have done this stuff
if I wouldn't have been encouraged

00:37:05.340 --> 00:37:09.320
or empowered to by just being around
Sumner for the past five years.

00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:12.050
Again, whatever you think
you're doing, for instance,

00:37:12.050 --> 00:37:16.760
I'm not a developer, but I'm on
the make WordPress accessible team

00:37:16.760 --> 00:37:19.990
and I'm just contributing in any
way I can because I just want

00:37:19.990 --> 00:37:22.570
to be around and continue
to learn and grow.

00:37:22.570 --> 00:37:26.140
Again, I encourage you,
go to your local meetup,

00:37:26.140 --> 00:37:29.700
attend to the make
meetings on Fridays.

00:37:29.700 --> 00:37:33.700
Anything you can do to learn
is something that's going

00:37:33.700 --> 00:37:35.650
to make an impact on your audience.

00:37:35.650 --> 00:37:40.480
I loved Meryl's story about,
she was sharing your story Sumner

00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:45.010
about the two business partners,
one of which was colorblind.

00:37:45.010 --> 00:37:49.240
He was working along aside a
partner who couldn't care less

00:37:49.240 --> 00:37:51.940
about that or didn't know
about it and didn't want

00:37:51.940 --> 00:37:54.320
to change his designs
to be more inclusive.

00:37:55.930 --> 00:38:00.930
Alicia, I've been chatting for a
while, just what would you like

00:38:00.930 --> 00:38:04.920
to share with folks walk watching
in terms of their journey

00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:08.100
as developers in terms
of the work they do

00:38:08.100 --> 00:38:11.050
in terms of making it accessible,
or what's the best way

00:38:11.050 --> 00:38:13.220
that you would, or what
advice would you give to them?

00:38:14.620 --> 00:38:15.620
<v Alicia> Oh, okay.

00:38:16.720 --> 00:38:19.110
It's fun to learn this stuff.

00:38:19.110 --> 00:38:20.570
It is really fun.

00:38:20.570 --> 00:38:22.367
At first,
it seems really overwhelming

00:38:22.367 --> 00:38:26.160
and you just have to start
where you are.

00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:28.440
A lot of times it's Googling.

00:38:30.120 --> 00:38:34.934
The most important thing
is to actually witness

00:38:34.935 --> 00:38:38.337
or find documentation
or demonstrations

00:38:38.338 --> 00:38:41.910
of people with
disabilities using the web

00:38:41.910 --> 00:38:45.680
and how they use their assisted
technology because then you start

00:38:45.680 --> 00:38:52.430
to think from the technology's
viewpoint because this has been said

00:38:52.430 --> 00:38:54.750
in some of the other sessions.

00:38:54.750 --> 00:38:56.900
A lot of times people will just
have, "Read more.

00:38:56.900 --> 00:38:57.570
Read more.

00:38:57.570 --> 00:38:59.260
Click here for links."

00:39:01.350 --> 00:39:04.580
With some assisted technologies,
they pull the links out

00:39:04.580 --> 00:39:07.550
and just put them on the sidebar
so they can just scan those.

00:39:07.550 --> 00:39:11.620
If you don't have more
than click here, read more,

00:39:11.620 --> 00:39:13.870
then they have no idea
what the context is.

00:39:13.870 --> 00:39:19.320
Actually, you put more context
around every piece of the site,

00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:23.561
every piece of the layout,
or the piece of this feature

00:39:23.561 --> 00:39:24.230
that's going in.

00:39:24.230 --> 00:39:25.810
What if this stood alone?

00:39:27.580 --> 00:39:32.760
I can't even remember,
but there was a situation--

00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:36.680
Oh, it was just organizing
some Dropbox folders.

00:39:36.680 --> 00:39:38.490
It comes into everything.

00:39:38.490 --> 00:39:41.080
We were organizing them by
year, but inside each folder,

00:39:41.080 --> 00:39:44.250
we used the same titles that
we'd have used in other years.

00:39:44.250 --> 00:39:47.080
I said, "No, what if one of
those folders is separate

00:39:47.080 --> 00:39:50.230
without the context
of its parent folder?

00:39:50.230 --> 00:39:53.850
Let's put the year in front of
every folder in the folder too."

00:39:55.560 --> 00:39:57.610
Your whole world
starts to change like,

00:39:57.610 --> 00:40:06.710
"We can make this better
organized for everybody."

00:40:06.710 --> 00:40:11.150
Also, there's an edX course that
I would suggest that everyone

00:40:13.750 --> 00:40:17.050
just checks that out because
like what has also been said

00:40:17.050 --> 00:40:19.370
in a lot of sessions is a
lot of us thought it was just

00:40:19.370 --> 00:40:22.180
for blind people that we
were doing this accessibility

00:40:22.180 --> 00:40:28.230
but that's probably, 1 out of 50
different disabilities that are

00:40:28.230 --> 00:40:29.490
being affected by the internet.

00:40:29.490 --> 00:40:30.490
[laughs]

00:40:30.820 --> 00:40:34.660
That course, the edX
course, is really good.

00:40:34.660 --> 00:40:39.510
I guess Joe will supply
that resource link.

00:40:39.510 --> 00:40:41.580
<v Joe> The other story
and it just came to mind

00:40:41.580 --> 00:40:45.100
while you were talking, and for
the folks that are out there,

00:40:45.100 --> 00:40:51.140
our group, we have our own
Slack channel, and we share wins

00:40:51.140 --> 00:40:52.810
with each other.

00:40:52.810 --> 00:40:55.300
There was a story that went
around about ActiveCampaign

00:40:55.300 --> 00:40:57.210
and someone reached out to them.

00:40:57.210 --> 00:40:58.900
<v Alicia> Yes,
that was another one.

00:40:58.900 --> 00:41:01.600
I was noticing that I couldn't
tap to the submit button.

00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:04.560
I was like, "Oh, that's bad."

00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:10.450
Then I told them about it, and
the support girl wrote back to me,

00:41:10.450 --> 00:41:12.690
"I'm sending this
straight to the top.

00:41:12.690 --> 00:41:14.580
It's got attention ASAP on it."

00:41:14.580 --> 00:41:16.320
I'm like, "Oh, cool."

00:41:16.320 --> 00:41:18.776
I just tested it again and
it seems to be working.

00:41:19.632 --> 00:41:20.112
<v Joe> Awesome.

00:41:20.112 --> 00:41:22.013
<v Alicia> [crosstalk]

00:41:22.013 --> 00:41:23.120
ActiveCampaign.

00:41:23.120 --> 00:41:26.120
<v Joe> You can make an impact just
by reaching out to these folks.

00:41:26.120 --> 00:41:29.130
I think one thing that's really
powerful about what you were talking

00:41:29.130 --> 00:41:32.880
about today is that these
people want to make changes,

00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:35.920
but they may not know that they
need to so by you reaching out,

00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:38.130
you're that conduit
to make it happen.

00:41:38.130 --> 00:41:39.950
For the group,
I wanted to toss this one out.

00:41:39.950 --> 00:41:41.030
What's next?

00:41:41.030 --> 00:41:44.420
What do you think as a
community would help us grow

00:41:44.420 --> 00:41:48.560
or what do you see as a challenge
or an issue that you want

00:41:48.560 --> 00:41:49.790
to share with the audience?

00:41:49.790 --> 00:41:52.250
At this point, anyone could
jump in and just [crosstalk].

00:41:52.250 --> 00:41:54.090
<v Alicia> I'll just
be really quick.

00:41:54.090 --> 00:41:55.580
Exposure.

00:41:55.580 --> 00:42:00.390
You don't have to know the code or
tech stuff, but, if you can write

00:42:00.390 --> 00:42:03.080
or if you have a blog,
just tell a story.

00:42:03.080 --> 00:42:05.210
A story about someone you know
trying to use the internet

00:42:06.690 --> 00:42:11.760
and have them talk about it or
write about how you discovered

00:42:11.760 --> 00:42:16.030
how to use ARIA label "polite"
so the slider goes through

00:42:16.030 --> 00:42:18.410
and it doesn't interrupt
someone in the screen reader

00:42:18.410 --> 00:42:20.080
while reading another
part of the site.

00:42:20.080 --> 00:42:22.550
Just anything that you know
about accessibility, make it fun

00:42:22.550 --> 00:42:24.880
and knowledgeable so that
it starts to be a thing

00:42:24.880 --> 00:42:26.700
that people run across
almost all the time.

00:42:28.710 --> 00:42:29.460
<v Joe> Sally?

00:42:29.460 --> 00:42:30.281
Ron?

00:42:32.261 --> 00:42:38.170
<v Ron> I could just encourage any
developers to wake up about this.

00:42:38.170 --> 00:42:43.040
It's something I wasn't focused on
at all for-- I've been doing this

00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:45.540
for maybe 23 years or so, 24 years.

00:42:47.130 --> 00:42:56.020
I put in text in all my images but
I was doing it completely wrong

00:42:56.020 --> 00:42:59.630
and out of ignorance and probably
for SEO as much as anything else.

00:43:02.340 --> 00:43:05.140
It's really, really important
and it's really, really dumb.

00:43:05.140 --> 00:43:08.900
It's just dumb not
to go this route.

00:43:08.900 --> 00:43:10.670
You're missing.

00:43:10.670 --> 00:43:18.160
You're excluding a huge swath of all
possible viewers of your material.

00:43:18.160 --> 00:43:23.930
For those with e-commerce
sites, you're excluding gigantic

00:43:23.930 --> 00:43:24.950
commercial opportunity.

00:43:26.710 --> 00:43:29.500
This work raises all boats.

00:43:29.500 --> 00:43:30.800
It's been shown.

00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:34.190
This is something in
Sumner's presentations.

00:43:34.190 --> 00:43:38.670
She shows you the curb cuts
and streets that were once

00:43:38.670 --> 00:43:44.390
just for wheelchair folks that
help all of us and there are many,

00:43:44.390 --> 00:43:47.140
many examples like that.

00:43:47.140 --> 00:43:54.030
It's completely insane that 90%
of websites do not help people

00:43:54.030 --> 00:43:55.030
with disabilities.

00:43:56.580 --> 00:44:01.080
At the same time, the list of
people with disabilities is growing.

00:44:02.690 --> 00:44:03.690
It's completely crazy.

00:44:05.170 --> 00:44:08.040
We just have to get to
work and we need to talk.

00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:11.260
Like Alicia said, we need to share.

00:44:11.260 --> 00:44:17.870
We who are doing it, need to talk
about it and share the techniques.

00:44:19.957 --> 00:44:20.830
<v Joe> All right.

00:44:20.830 --> 00:44:25.420
Sally, before we turn it over to
the Sumner, any thoughts you want

00:44:25.420 --> 00:44:26.450
to add at this point?

00:44:27.743 --> 00:44:30.950
<v Sally> With the virtual world
now, there are so many opportunities

00:44:30.950 --> 00:44:32.500
to learn and join.

00:44:34.280 --> 00:44:37.590
Amber Heinz has a Facebook
group, so if you're stuck,

00:44:37.590 --> 00:44:40.490
you can always get
answers in there.

00:44:40.490 --> 00:44:45.110
I was going to plug Sumner's
meetup resuming in 2023,

00:44:45.110 --> 00:44:48.940
but I'm going to let her do that
because you'll learn a lot there

00:44:48.940 --> 00:44:53.820
as well and actually get to practice
too because you can take the courses,

00:44:53.820 --> 00:44:58.720
but you need to practice
it to really understand it

00:44:58.720 --> 00:45:04.730
and her WordPress meetup does
that and just attend them.

00:45:04.730 --> 00:45:08.637
Everyone is so welcoming
and accessibility benefits

00:45:08.638 --> 00:45:12.610
not just those living with
different abilities, but all of us.

00:45:12.610 --> 00:45:16.300
You look at the curb cuts that were
initially meant for wheelchairs,

00:45:16.300 --> 00:45:17.630
everyone uses them now.

00:45:18.740 --> 00:45:21.910
Every time I use something
of convenience, it goes,

00:45:21.910 --> 00:45:26.870
"Oh, that had been created
for people that were living

00:45:26.870 --> 00:45:29.630
with a disability and
now we all enjoy it too."

00:45:29.630 --> 00:45:33.200
It's just the common goal just
to make the web accessible

00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:37.990
for all abilities and,
it's just the greatest feeling

00:45:37.990 --> 00:45:40.071
when you contribute to that.

00:45:40.071 --> 00:45:41.239
<v Joe> Awesome.

00:45:42.029 --> 00:45:44.690
Sumner,
we have about three minutes left.

00:45:44.690 --> 00:45:47.580
I want to give it to you to
do whatever you want with it,

00:45:47.580 --> 00:45:51.810
because again, for folks
watching someone could step

00:45:51.810 --> 00:45:55.420
into your community and make
an incredible difference.

00:45:55.420 --> 00:45:58.600
Like I said, I was hoping to make
a difference in my community,

00:45:58.600 --> 00:46:01.910
but meeting Sumner took it in
a whole different direction

00:46:01.910 --> 00:46:03.420
that I couldn't imagine.

00:46:03.420 --> 00:46:07.980
Sumner, thank you and what would
you like to leave the audience

00:46:07.980 --> 00:46:08.980
with today?

00:46:11.569 --> 00:46:15.940
<v Sumner> I'm thrilled
that we have so many people

00:46:15.940 --> 00:46:18.690
that have an interest
in accessibility.

00:46:18.690 --> 00:46:24.010
The more people that are interested,
the more we're going to accomplish.

00:46:24.010 --> 00:46:26.700
I would like to encourage
people to learn more.

00:46:26.700 --> 00:46:31.200
We have a lot of people now
more than we've had in the past

00:46:31.200 --> 00:46:33.940
that are speaking up and
saying, "The reason is

00:46:33.940 --> 00:46:35.280
to make something accessible.

00:46:35.280 --> 00:46:36.840
We need fixers.

00:46:36.840 --> 00:46:40.260
We need people that will fix a
website natively, correctly."

00:46:42.860 --> 00:46:45.550
It's a wonderful
opportunity to do that.

00:46:45.550 --> 00:46:49.630
At the same time,
we also want to make sure

00:46:49.630 --> 00:46:51.360
that we keep networking
with each other.

00:46:51.360 --> 00:46:53.300
We keep supporting each other.

00:46:53.300 --> 00:46:55.200
We keep reaching out.

00:46:55.200 --> 00:46:59.370
Like it was mentioned, it's not
my meetup, it's Rons and Jennifers

00:46:59.370 --> 00:47:03.050
and mine collectively, and it's
our community meetup for WordPress

00:47:03.050 --> 00:47:06.430
and accessibility but our
objective was lets teach

00:47:06.430 --> 00:47:08.910
and then let put it in practice.

00:47:08.910 --> 00:47:11.640
When you learn something,
put it in practice,

00:47:11.640 --> 00:47:15.670
learn how to do it really
well, and get involved.

00:47:15.670 --> 00:47:18.890
Joe mentioned make that WordPress.

00:47:18.890 --> 00:47:22.070
Earlier today, I know there was
a conversation about captions.

00:47:22.070 --> 00:47:27.090
Go to WordPress TV, find a
video, one that doesn't have

00:47:27.090 --> 00:47:30.870
a caption file yet,
and learn how to do correct captions

00:47:30.870 --> 00:47:33.570
and contribute to the
community by doing that.

00:47:33.570 --> 00:47:38.210
You will learn so much and you
might get hooked and you might want

00:47:38.210 --> 00:47:40.170
to just keep doing it.

00:47:40.170 --> 00:47:45.190
The big takeaway is get involved,
stay involved, hang around

00:47:45.190 --> 00:47:48.050
with great people like
this, and it becomes fun.

00:47:49.570 --> 00:47:52.170
Joe Thank you so much, Sumner.

00:47:52.170 --> 00:47:55.960
Again, you've met our family,
make sure to reach out to us

00:47:55.960 --> 00:47:58.850
if you have any questions,
and we can encourage you

00:47:58.850 --> 00:48:03.710
and help you grow your community
and grow the accessibility

00:48:03.710 --> 00:48:04.910
of WordPress.

00:48:04.910 --> 00:48:07.410
Thanks for sharing your day
with us and have a great event.

00:48:07.410 --> 00:48:19.797
[pause]

00:48:19.797 --> 00:48:21.960
<v Abbas> Thank you everybody
for attending this session

00:48:21.960 --> 00:48:26.350
with Sumner Davenport, Alicia St.
Rose, Joe A. Simpson Jr.

00:48:26.350 --> 00:48:29.140

00:48:29.140 --> 00:48:33.070
You can continue the conversation
in our chat or on social media.

00:48:33.070 --> 00:48:40.430
We ask that you use the hashtag

00:49:05.500 --> 00:49:09.610
Meeting WCAG 2 without
rebuilding from scratch.

00:49:09.610 --> 00:49:13.840
That's presented by Michael Ziemak,
the project manager at Cut2Code.

00:49:13.840 --> 00:49:16.950
