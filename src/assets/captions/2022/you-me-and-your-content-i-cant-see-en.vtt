00:00:29.997 --> 00:00:33.390
HOST: Next talk in
this session is You, Me,

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.540
and Your Content I Can't See.

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.660
Presented by Amy Carney.

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:42.890
Amy is an accessibility specialist
and web developer at Digilou.

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.280
There will be no Q&A
during this lightning round

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.090
but please use the ideas section
to Chat with other attendees.

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.880
Amy is here in the Chat and can
answer your questions there.

00:00:57.037 --> 00:01:02.000
AMY CARNEY: I'm Amy Carney and
I'm an independent web designer

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.880
and developer and
accessibility consultant.

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.210
In my talk You, Me, and Your
Content I Can't See, I want to share

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.370
with you about my disability.

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:16.890
How we customize my devices and
what barriers I've encountered

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.520
on the web and suggestions
on how you can help.

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.920
So, I was born visually impaired.

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.220
I choose that label for
myself because it was the one

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.625
that I was given in childhood

00:01:31.625 --> 00:01:34.390
and it's the one best
[unintelligible 01:37]

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.590
how I fit this visual world.

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:40.800
I'm not blind.

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.390
Legally and medically.

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.930
I don't qualify as legally
blind or even low vision.

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.090
But I can easily get a doctor's
note when I feel accommodations

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:51.090
are necessary.

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.290
I've never lost vision.

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.360
I've been given what
I've been given.

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.130
If anything, I've been
given more but it's fragile.

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:02.550
I rely on my glasses.

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:09.570
My thick lenses are a daily reminder
of the two worlds I live in.

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:11.650
Abled and disabled.

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.600
My glasses are my core assistive
technology you could say.

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.780
They keep my foot in
the world visual world

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.670
and maintain the
illusion that I'm abled.

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:26.380
Rather than going to the medical
specifics, I’d much rather describe

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.270
what my vision is like.

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:30.110
One eye is foggy.

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:31.590
I can't read with it.

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.300
I can't even distinguish
details with it.

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.130
Color and movement are
definitely my allies.

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:40.480
It really throws a wrench into my
depth perception and allows people

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:41.780
to sneak up on me on that side.

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:47.820
My other eye‘ s perception filled
isn't limited by my glasses.

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:51.080
Everything outside
of my lens is foggy.

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.880
Even with the lens, I don't have a
usable vision for the entire lens

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.200
because I have a bifocals.

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:01.870
A reading lens and a distance
lens [unintelligible 03:05]

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:07.760
for that space and when it tapers
off, so the prescription tapes off

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.360
for the magnification
strength I need.

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:18.020
So truly, I look through a small
focal point in my lens for clarity

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:19.020
and focus.

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.630
Thanks to surgeries and how my
anatomy is, I'm light-sensitive.

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.610
So bright light environments
can give me headaches.

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:34.680
To add to it, my eyes move
back and forth involuntarily.

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.570
They're trying to gather as
much visual information around

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:42.960
as possible but ironically that
can make focusing on things tricky.

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:51.640
I rely heavily on color,
contrast and movement.

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:57.670
With my clear eye to be able
to see as well as my foggy eye.

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:02.760
In the off-line world, sound and
touch are critical for understanding

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:03.830
what I'm seeing.

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:09.500
So, how do I as a visually
impaired person survive

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.410
in such a visually heavy world?

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:14.270
I join tech.

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:16.520
Computers accommodating to
me without me having to ask.

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:22.060
At a hardware level,
I can use bigger monitors.

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:25.330
I use devices that have the
accessibility options that I need,

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:26.330
which I'll discuss soon.

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:31.230
I allow my devices to
talk to each other.

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:33.340
So, thank you very
much Apple ecosystem.

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:38.230
At a system level,
I can enlarge the text size.

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:41.000
I can change the color scheme
whether it be high contrast mode

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.450
which my preference is yellow
on block or I can do dark mode.

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:49.610
I decreased the screen
resolution to make things bigger.

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:51.480
I make icons bigger.

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:54.640
I magnify the full screen.

00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:01.150
I show text on hover like
a tool tip when I hover.

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:05.250
run my mouse pointer over
something like an image or text.

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:09.390
It will show the text in larger
print or even show me the alt text

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:10.390
of an image.

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:14.270
I have text spoken aloud
to me by the computer.

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:15.480
It's not a screen reader.

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:19.390
It's just a speak feature to do
whether a paragraph or a whole page.

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:26.160
I enlarge my mouse cursor size and
also customize it so it's yellow

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.980
to contrast on my dark mode Black.

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:31.780
I navigate by keyboard.

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:35.320
I have a keyboard and mouse user.

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:37.050
I use the keyboard
as much as possible

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:40.410
because there is a certain
tactileness to it and I can know

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:45.520
where I'm at but I use mouse
just because that's how things

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.170
are more easily reachable.

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:49.070
It really just depends
on the context.

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:52.260
But I know a whole lot of
shortcuts for my keyboard just

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:53.490
to make things easier for me.

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:59.160
For notifications, I receive
alerts through sound and flashing.

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:03.040
So, sometimes I can catch the
notification coming up at the corner

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:04.940
of my screen or above my screen.

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:09.100
For my laptop, I prefer sound
to go off so I know it's there.

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:12.730
When I have things magnified,
my screen will flash,

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:15.280
wants to let me know
I got a notification.

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:18.632
Additionally, I increase contrast

00:06:18.633 --> 00:06:21.430
with my system just
a little bit enough

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:22.960
to make things stand
out a little more.

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:26.930
At a browser level, I can Zoom in.

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:35.630
To be clear, I really only
Zoom and about 115-130% max

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:40.350
because I have a lot of things
changed already at the system level.

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:43.370
So I’ll Zoom in just a little
bit more on the browser.

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:47.030
I often switched to reader mode.

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:50.040
Especially for blogs
in a long articles.

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:53.430
I'm a Firefox user on my
laptop which has reader mode

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:56.230
and allows me to use
white text on black.

00:06:56.230 --> 00:07:00.640
It also has an audio feature
that will read text aloud to me.

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:05.030
On my iPhone, I have Safari as my
browser and that has a reader mode

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:06.760
as well and lets me
do the same thing.

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:12.560
Additionally, the browser I
consider the search text tool

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:15.290
as an accessibility tool for me.

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:19.340
I can press control F and
then I can quickly find

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:21.174
the information I'm
looking for especially

00:07:21.174 --> 00:07:22.590
on articles I've read before

00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:26.640
and it doesn't have to be a
tedious task to be able to find

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:27.640
what I read.

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:33.070
So, what prevents me from
reading your content?

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:39.150
Well, when things are fixed
on the screen, a nav bar,

00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:43.780
a footer or God forbid if
both fixed on the screen,

00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:46.420
it narrows down my reading filled.

00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:49.050
Think about how you read things.

00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:51.640
You’re really skimming aren’t you.

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:54.010
Your eyes kind of skip
around in a pattern.

00:07:54.010 --> 00:07:55.980
You're looking for keywords.

00:07:55.980 --> 00:07:58.740
You don't just slowly read text.

00:07:59.950 --> 00:08:03.140
And with that in mind,
sometimes I'm limited to three lines

00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:05.030
at a time on my laptop.

00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:07.230
And that's a 16-inch screen.

00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:12.460
So that can get very fatiguing to
be able to read a minimal amount

00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:16.860
of text at a time when I'm not
even enlarging it more than 115%,

00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:17.860
it's ridiculous.

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:22.990
Ellipsis, hidden
content, the three dots.

00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:27.970
People like to hide content because
they like their neat little cards

00:08:27.970 --> 00:08:31.130
or boxes of information
with fixed width and height

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:37.201
and often times that
information isn't available

00:08:37.202 --> 00:08:39.650
beyond those three dots.

00:08:39.650 --> 00:08:43.250
There is no link to go
to read more elsewhere.

00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:44.250
There's not a pop-up.

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:46.480
It doesn't expand.

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:47.590
It's just gone.

00:08:48.690 --> 00:08:51.160
And that's terrible
when I enlarge my text.

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:54.310
The more I have my text enlarged,
whether it's at system level

00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:57.370
or browser level,
more content disappears.

00:08:57.370 --> 00:08:59.180
And I can't ever get to it.

00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:00.180
Is a true blocker.

00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:06.530
Other problems that come along with
fixed width and height for boxes

00:09:06.530 --> 00:09:13.820
and cards and such even half bars
sometimes is that content will tend

00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:15.020
to overlap.

00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:20.030
It's not allowing text to
push the container size

00:09:20.030 --> 00:09:23.660
and so when it starts overlapping
it makes things unreadable.

00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:26.790
I see this a lot in nav bars
too because people think it has

00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:27.840
to be a certain size.

00:09:30.967 --> 00:09:37.926
On that note, mobile apps in
particular that don't adapt

00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:40.930
from portrait to landscape.

00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:46.560
When I like to read longer text,
I like to go into landscape mode

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:48.310
where there's more
information to read.

00:09:48.310 --> 00:09:52.290
So it creates a better flow,
more words per line for me.

00:09:52.290 --> 00:09:54.110
Despite my text size.

00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:57.870
And when I don't have a landscape
option the reading feels very choppy.

00:09:59.110 --> 00:10:00.940
Sometimes things will
start to overlap.

00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:06.650
Bright, white backgrounds,
that stark white

00:10:06.650 --> 00:10:12.110
in feeding text can be
really hard when you dampen

00:10:12.110 --> 00:10:15.750
that a little bit it helps
but bright, bright whites.

00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:19.220
Especially when I'm functioning off
of dark mode, it can be very jarring.

00:10:20.990 --> 00:10:22.880
Small unscalable text.

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:28.670
It's astounding to me
in 2022 that people are

00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:32.750
still creating font size
with pixels when it needs

00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:36.120
to be more flexible than that
and respect people settings

00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:37.470
with more relative units.

00:10:38.830 --> 00:10:41.370
For contrast,
that's still a big one.

00:10:41.370 --> 00:10:45.680
This whole gray text on
white is really tough.

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:49.990
And I've seen a lot where borders
and things aren't enough contrast

00:10:49.990 --> 00:10:53.480
so even when I increase my
contrast, they kinda fade away.

00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:55.790
So I can't see where
my input boxes at.

00:10:56.870 --> 00:10:57.870
It's weird.

00:10:59.170 --> 00:11:01.250
Very confusing because I
can't find the input box.

00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:05.430
And lastly, overlays.

00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:06.630
Any type of overlay.

00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:12.510
Back to top links that are
fixed at the bottom oftentimes

00:11:12.510 --> 00:11:14.670
those will cover up
part of the text.

00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:19.500
Chat box bubbles, video ads
because those actually tend

00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:20.770
to cover up my whole content.

00:11:22.650 --> 00:11:26.240
Social media links when
those are fixed to the side.

00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:30.010
They will literally cover
a chunk of the paragraph.

00:11:30.010 --> 00:11:32.530
That I can't read the paragraph
even though I'm scrolling through

00:11:32.530 --> 00:11:33.530
because they're stacked.

00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:38.870
And then accessibility widgets
that are supposed to be helpful

00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:41.240
but they are counterproductive.

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:45.700
I've tried experimenting
with those to see

00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:48.900
if increasing text
size would be good.

00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:52.190
But instead it ends up
smashing things together

00:11:52.190 --> 00:11:55.200
because the layout
doesn't really flow.

00:11:57.130 --> 00:12:02.040
The contrast doesn't always work
out because it's not thought out

00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:05.610
and so sometimes links will
not have a good contrast color

00:12:05.610 --> 00:12:10.640
even though regular text might have
the white or the yellow on Black.

00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:16.000
So, those kinds of things aren't very
helpful to someone like me at all.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.220
Just let me use what I'm doing with
my system and my browser settings.

00:12:22.390 --> 00:12:25.340
So, despite this long list
of things you're probably

00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:28.760
either feeling overwhelmed by how can
I tackle these each of these things.

00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:34.270
But I want to encourage you not
to overthink it what you need

00:12:34.270 --> 00:12:35.360
to do for this.

00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:37.740
I've shared these details
about my experiences,

00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:41.850
my disability problems I've
had to help you understand

00:12:41.850 --> 00:12:46.080
that I don't fit into a neatly
wrapped visually disabled box.

00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:49.700
But each bullet point I've
shared shouldn't be addressed

00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:52.570
as an entire checklist of
things for you to go through.

00:12:53.990 --> 00:12:55.850
I want to encourage you
that if you're following

00:12:55.850 --> 00:12:59.900
the Web content accessibility
guidelines WCAG.

00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:04.160
You're actually going to fulfill
my wish list of things that I like

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:08.510
to see better about the web because
they advocate for me in that way.

00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:11.710
So here's what I want.

00:13:11.710 --> 00:13:14.200
I want text that scalable.

00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:18.700
Relative units not fixed units,
I want colors that respect

00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:22.720
might skim preferences,
if you have taken the time

00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:25.400
to create a dark mode
theme, that's wonderful.

00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:26.580
I appreciate that.

00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:31.210
But if I'm using Windows high
contrast mode, I want to be able

00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:32.440
to see outlines in SPT's.

00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:36.780
It's amazing how many times those
things disappear if I switch over

00:13:36.780 --> 00:13:38.190
to Windows high contrast mode.

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:46.030
I'd also like to see light
backgrounds that don't overwhelm

00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:48.000
or fatigue me or
give me a headache.

00:13:50.540 --> 00:13:54.740
I want strong color contrast
between the text doing borders,

00:13:54.740 --> 00:13:56.430
outlines, background.

00:13:58.140 --> 00:14:05.910
I appreciate that people try to
be, meet criteria for the 4.5

00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:09.940
to one but sometimes I need it to
pop a little bit more especially

00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:15.200
with the way I do my custom
settings on my machines.

00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:18.470
So if you can make it pop a little
bit more, I'd like to see that.

00:14:19.650 --> 00:14:22.220
I need a reader mode compatibility.

00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:27.880
WordPress themes often are reader
mode compatible so I can go

00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:33.810
to somebody's WordPress blog
and I'll be able to toggle over

00:14:33.810 --> 00:14:38.560
to reader mode but there's still
quite a few news websites out there

00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:43.490
and other people's blogs that I'm
still stuck with their choices

00:14:43.490 --> 00:14:44.550
and not my choices.

00:14:46.270 --> 00:14:49.960
Flexible layouts I need
things to expand and reflow

00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:51.730
when my text is bigger.

00:14:51.730 --> 00:14:54.970
Regardless of what I’ve chosen
for my systems resolution

00:14:54.970 --> 00:14:55.970
and take settings.

00:14:57.190 --> 00:15:00.520
I want to be able
to read the content.

00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:02.540
I want it to not
overlap or disappear.

00:15:04.910 --> 00:15:07.960
Next, I need a strong
visible focus indicators.

00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:12.140
So as I'm a heavy keyboard
user, I want to be able to see

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:15.980
where my focus is that especially
when I'm filling out a form

00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:20.570
or even see where the link is
if I'm tabbing through something

00:15:20.570 --> 00:15:22.450
that has a lot of links
or the navigation.

00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:26.440
I need decent white space.

00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:28.780
Some visual breathing
room on the page.

00:15:28.780 --> 00:15:31.780
You know,
not too tight but not too sparse.

00:15:31.780 --> 00:15:32.810
I need a little bit of room.

00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:41.840
I also would like to see all mobile
apps be able to use landscape

00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:42.910
and portrait.

00:15:42.910 --> 00:15:44.270
That's the right thing to do.

00:15:44.270 --> 00:15:46.270
Because I need that
on a lot of things.

00:15:46.270 --> 00:15:51.080
I cannot see any reason
immediately of why there would

00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:55.710
only be portrait view for any app.

00:15:55.710 --> 00:16:00.150
As I mentioned earlier,
please no sticky objects on the page.

00:16:00.150 --> 00:16:04.960
Get rid of that Chat
box that pops up.

00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:11.190
Open it up somewhere else or have
the round button somewhere else

00:16:11.190 --> 00:16:14.340
that I can just get to may
be in the navigation bar.

00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:18.410
Stop sticky navigation, I promise
you I can find your navigation

00:16:18.410 --> 00:16:21.020
and I have a keyboard
shortcut for that.

00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:22.500
I can find what I need.

00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:25.480
So please stop sticking things
in the way of the content

00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:26.600
that you want me to read.

00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:31.530
And lastly,
don't use accessibility overlays.

00:16:31.530 --> 00:16:34.050
They are completely useless to me.

00:16:34.050 --> 00:16:37.260
They are counterproductive
and they usually don't work.

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:40.360
They work against the
settings that I already have.

00:16:42.870 --> 00:16:45.730
So, that's all I've
got to share today.

00:16:45.730 --> 00:16:47.580
I hope you found it useful.

00:16:47.580 --> 00:16:50.270
If you have questions,
you can find me on Twitter.

00:16:50.270 --> 00:17:03.322
I'm very active on there
@click2carney or on Github @digilou.

00:17:03.990 --> 00:17:06.230
If you're curious about
how I started out learning

00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:12.532
about web accessibility check
out my blog at 100daysofa11Ycom.

00:17:12.533 --> 00:17:13.873
Thanks for listening.

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:18.060
I hope you'll join me in making
a better web for everyone.
