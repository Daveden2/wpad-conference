00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:31.480
>> DANIELLE ZARCARO: Hello.

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:35.430
Welcome to WordPress Accessibility
Day my name is Danielle

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.040
and I am the founder
of Overnight Website

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.960
and Kinetic Iris web
development studio.

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.110
Thank you for joining us for
Accessibility is a partnership

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.890
that requires communication
with Maxwell Ivey.

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.090
Max has transformed himself
from a totally blind,

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:56.370
failed carnival owner to a
respected amusement equipment broker

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.970
and is known as The Blind Blogger.

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:04.290
He has written four books, been
interviewed on over 350 podcasts.

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.160
Started teaching people how to be
great guests, began booking people

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:12.250
on shows, and eventually
started his own podcast called

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:14.180
What's Your Excuse?

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.790
Please feel free to add your
questions in the Q&A tab next

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.840
to the video and we'll answer
them at the end of the session

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.260
and use the ideas section to
chat with other attendees.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:26.480
Max, take it away.

00:01:28.288 --> 00:01:30.300
>> MAXWELL IVEY: I appreciate
the opportunity to speak

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:34.450
to my community that being the
WordPress users and developers

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.380
so thank you for this.

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:41.690
I want to let people know that
while we want the internet

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:44.040
to be 100% accessible.

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.870
I'm not here to slap your hands
or scare you that you're going

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:52.620
to get sued, I'm here to
encourage you to see accessibility

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:55.390
as something that has a value to
you, to your business,

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.120
to your profitability,
to your competitive advantage.

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.410
Also that you don't
have to do this at all

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:07.270
because I've realized that creating
accessibility on a website is hard

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.680
for your information because I think
it's relevant to this conversation.

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:18.220
When I first got online in 2007 I
did not have access to WordPress

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.270
so I had to teach
myself how to code HTML.

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.130
I had to write Java and
I had to find people

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:27.180
who would loan me Java and PHP
code to put it in my website

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.100
to make it do things I wasn't
capable of making it do

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.120
and I did that for five years.

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.280
I've got a lot of built-up
horrible code in my background

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.250
that will all eventually be
updated to not only be pretty code

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:41.150
but be accessible.

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.280
I understand what it is
to be a website owner,

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.250
to be a small business owner,
to have limited skills, ability,

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:48.560
talent, or money.

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.780
Then to have somebody come
along and go "Wait a minute,

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:55.390
your website isn't accessible
you need to make it accessible."

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.990
I just want you all to know that
I understand where you're at

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:01.200
and I'm going to do my best
to make you feel better

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.900
about the process and
challenge you and encourage you

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.130
to take action towards
making your products

00:03:07.131 --> 00:03:08.650
and services more accessible.

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:16.500
First, it isn't easy if we just take
accessibility for screenreader users

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.380
and that's not even the entire
visually impaired community

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.120
that will use a website.

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.060
If we just go to screen reader
users and I'm doing that

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.340
because that's my area of
experience, if we just go there

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.940
we have two different
operating systems.

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.910
We have Windows and Mac which I'm
sure y'all are both aware of that.

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:39.660
Within those two operating
systems, you may have

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:42.200
two different screen
reader options.

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.510
For Mac you have voiceover.

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.850
If you create a program
or website for iOS devices

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:53.440
which is Mac's mobile option,
then you have a whole other standards

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.560
or rules that you have to code
by to make your app accessible.

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:00.470
You look at Windows, you have
Microsoft, and with Microsoft,

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:03.160
you have JAWS for Windows or NVDA.

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:07.530
These are all screen readers
for people who have no vision

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:11.160
or very little or at least have
so little that they have to depend

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:12.860
on a text-to-speech option.

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:19.230
Once you get past Microsoft
you also have Android

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:23.910
and Android is now doing much
better with their talk-back app

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:27.800
to where it is becoming accessible
at least with site assistance

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.560
during setup on quite a few things.

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.690
For the Android device,
Android is coming along

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:35.850
so you've got all these
different platforms.

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:39.090
In addition to that, you have
different levels of visual acuity,

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:44.250
somebody that has a high
level of vision may only need

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:49.040
some small amount of screen
reader accessibility.

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:53.930
Somebody who has a real need
for total screen reader use

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:55.990
may have cited assistance.

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:01.180
Then even beyond the technology
you have available to you

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:04.790
and your ability you
have comfort level.

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:09.340
Depending on the training you
have received with your devices

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:11.930
or the training you have never
received with your devices

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:15.183
that's going to
affect how comfortable

00:05:15.184 --> 00:05:17.260
you are trying certain types
of things.

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:21.670
Or trying to figure things
out as opposed to requesting

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:25.560
or even demanding that accessibility
be addressed more fully.

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:31.420
Then you have to
remember that even people

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:35.330
that have the same visual acuity
and the same disease we are all

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:36.330
still human beings.

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:39.400
We are all still individuals
who happen to have vision loss.

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:44.450
You could give two people with
the exact same circumstances,

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:48.060
the exact same question and they
would find two different ways

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:49.370
to arrive at the answer.

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:51.420
I just want to wait.

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:53.550
Now I understand
that this is not easy

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:57.240
but just because it is challenging
doesn't mean that we don't do it

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:59.490
or that we can't do it.

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:04.370
Because it is challenging it gives
us the opportunity to stand out

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:07.310
until everybody else on the
internet decides to come along

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:08.660
and make their websites accessible.

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:12.120
By the way,
I do want to applaud WordPress

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:17.310
because WordPress has done a lot in
the area of making their platform

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:20.020
and the apps that play on
their platform accessible.

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:26.830
I have had very little real problems
with anything from WordPress

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:28.750
for the last three years.

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:31.220
I want to applaud WordPress
for their investment

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:34.530
because not only do they spend
a lot of time on the backend,

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:37.910
they address this with people
who want to create plugins.

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:41.600
They address this at every WordCamp
session they've had for who knows

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:46.360
how long now so you want
to give them their props.

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:49.610
Just because it's difficult,
because a lot of people don't do it,

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:51.150
it gives you a way to stand out.

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:57.760
Think about this, there are roughly
one billion people in the world

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:00.330
that have a disability,
I think it's probably about 300,

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:03.980
350 million of those have
a vision loss disability.

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:05.640
We're talking about
a pretty big pool

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:06.980
and I'm sure you've
already heard those numbers

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:09.510
but here's a number I
believe you haven't heard.

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:15.160
Only 3% of websites on the
internet are accessible

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:18.530
to the agreed-upon
standards for access.

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:22.340
That means that if you
become one of those companies

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:28.030
that has that level of access
that makes people like me,

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:30.550
people with autism, deaf
people, people in wheelchairs

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:33.830
with motor issues you make
us feel welcome we want

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:35.120
to spend our money with you.

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:39.740
I am quite often spending time
talking to your business owners

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:45.490
about how as a rule the disability
community is very brand loyal.

00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:47.990
We will stick with companies
that invest to show us

00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:50.720
that they appreciate our
business and want us to be part

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:52.844
of the solutions to
make their products

00:07:52.845 --> 00:07:55.510
or services more user-friendly
for us.

00:07:55.510 --> 00:07:58.260
We will tell our friends and
our neighbors and our coworkers

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.230
and our social media networks.

00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:02.670
If we find something really
good we'll even tell our enemies

00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:07.670
about it because we just
want to advocate, we want

00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:12.530
to help each other deal with
our accessibility issues.

00:08:13.890 --> 00:08:17.170
If you think about it by making
your product more accessibility,

00:08:17.170 --> 00:08:20.610
making your website more
available, you're gaining

00:08:20.610 --> 00:08:24.840
an entire marketing department,
thousands of people who won't have

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:28.690
to be paid a dime to tell
people how good you are.

00:08:28.690 --> 00:08:32.980
It is hard but there's a definite
return on the investment.

00:08:34.590 --> 00:08:38.400
I said in my title that I was
going to talk about a partnership,

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:42.660
I personally believe and it's
been proven out my own life

00:08:42.660 --> 00:08:48.080
for years now that we can only
get so far with compliance.

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:53.040
Even if we had a perfect set of
standards, even if they were adopted

00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:57.960
on a global level, even if we had
perfect enforcement of those laws.

00:08:57.960 --> 00:08:59.700
That would only get us so
far because there would

00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:02.580
still be a certain number of
people who would either find a way

00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:07.580
to avoid the law or who would
do just the bare minimum

00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:09.620
to avoid being
penalized by the law.

00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:13.040
I personally believe it's
a lot at least a good part

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:17.600
of this means saying
hello this is who I am,

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:20.310
these are my needs I
would really appreciate

00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:23.380
if you could make
this thing accessible.

00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:26.000
I want to share a couple
of examples with you

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.820
of experiences I've
had with companies.

00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:30.800
A couple of them pretty
large companies actually

00:09:32.210 --> 00:09:36.160
just so y'all know I don't get
any trouble with WordPress.

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:39.390
I do not have affiliate links for
these people, I'm not getting paid

00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:42.150
by these people, I just mentioned
them because they're part

00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:43.560
of the example.

00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:46.690
I think that if people
didn't know who I was talking

00:09:46.690 --> 00:09:50.350
about the argument
wouldn't make sense.

00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:54.140
As a blind person that's been
online, that's had a website

00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:56.430
for over 15 years now.

00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:01.690
I have been in a lot of situations
where I just didn't have a way

00:10:01.690 --> 00:10:04.060
to make it do what I wanted to.

00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:06.300
That continues up to today.

00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:10.600
What I usually do is if I go
to a company and I'm going

00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:13.590
to use their product or service,
I'm going to spend a lot of time

00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:15.030
on their website.

00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:17.180
I go and find the
customer service person

00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:19.920
or the technical support person,
and I send them an email,

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:22.290
and I say, "Hey, I'm Max Ivey.

00:10:22.290 --> 00:10:23.600
I'm totally blind.

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:25.030
People know me as
The Blind Blogger.

00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:33.790
I have a website and a podcast, and
I'm planning on using your offering.

00:10:33.790 --> 00:10:37.150
I don't expect to have
problems with it, but if I do,

00:10:37.150 --> 00:10:39.310
I would like you to know who I
am, because I would hate

00:10:39.310 --> 00:10:43.570
for my first message to
you to be me submitting one

00:10:43.570 --> 00:10:46.010
of those tickets saying
that you've got a problem.

00:10:47.090 --> 00:10:50.360
That's where I usually start
and as a result, I've had a lot

00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:55.870
of great conversations with people
on that side of the company,

00:10:55.870 --> 00:10:58.070
and I think a lot of it
is because I reached out

00:10:58.070 --> 00:11:01.420
to them before I had a problem,
and the conversation started off

00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:02.350
as friendly.

00:11:02.350 --> 00:11:06.590
Of course, I understand if
there are people watching

00:11:06.590 --> 00:11:09.420
who would take the alternate
side of that position,

00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:14.460
but I really do believe we have
to help them, and they have

00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:18.120
to help us and we can't do
that unless we communicate

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:21.110
and collaborate and work as
partners or at least try to.

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:27.080
About six years ago,
I joined a platform called Nepris,

00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:33.890
which is a free online e-learning
platform that connects teachers

00:11:33.890 --> 00:11:38.870
with professionals, experts in
order that they can come on Zoom

00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:43.600
or other virtual platforms and give
talks to these teachers' classes.

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:48.210
I heard about it and thought that
sounded cool so I filled out the form

00:11:48.210 --> 00:11:51.310
to join the website,
only to find out that very little

00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:53.190
of the website was accessible.

00:11:53.190 --> 00:11:58.310
I sent them an email and explained
my problem and of course,

00:11:58.310 --> 00:12:00.650
the first problem was,
I could not create a profile.

00:12:00.650 --> 00:12:04.190
I couldn't tell people who I
was, what my background was,

00:12:04.190 --> 00:12:07.340
or what my favorite
topics to speak on were.

00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:10.470
Without that, they would have
no way to know if they wanted

00:12:10.470 --> 00:12:12.950
to select me to speak
to their kids or not.

00:12:14.670 --> 00:12:16.920
They scheduled a Zoom call with me.

00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:19.690
We spent about 30 minutes
discussing my background

00:12:19.690 --> 00:12:21.870
and what I wanted to speak about.

00:12:21.870 --> 00:12:26.370
They created a profile and
email document, sent it to me.

00:12:26.370 --> 00:12:30.270
I reviewed it, made a few corrections
to it, sent it back to them.

00:12:30.270 --> 00:12:31.270
We got that up.

00:12:32.350 --> 00:12:35.490
They put the categories,
I want to speak to.

00:12:35.490 --> 00:12:42.840
I was just so thrilled in 2018
when I finally got my first class

00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:44.190
for booking.

00:12:44.190 --> 00:12:49.390
They wanted somebody to speak
to a group of kindergarteners

00:12:49.390 --> 00:12:53.170
and first-grade students with
special needs in Chicago.

00:12:53.170 --> 00:12:54.280
I get the link.

00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:55.670
I click the button.

00:12:55.670 --> 00:12:57.260
I can't click the button.

00:12:57.260 --> 00:13:01.860
I reached back out to him and
go, "Hey," they asked me

00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:03.270
which time slot I wanted.

00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:06.790
They scheduled it,
and they also told me,

00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:09.010
"Mr. Ivey, when you get
ready to give this talk,

00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:14.880
we're going to send you an email
with a direct link to the similiar."

00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:18.870
The reason for that is having
a website where you deal

00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:20.150
with lots of young people.

00:13:20.150 --> 00:13:24.420
There are privacy issues, they can't
run Zoom just in Zoom they have

00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:28.420
to run it within a secure
platform on the back end.

00:13:28.420 --> 00:13:29.260
They sent me the link.

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:30.220
I logged on.

00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:32.200
I had a great conversation
with the tech person

00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:36.320
for 15 minutes before I talk
and had a wonderful talk

00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:38.750
with the school kids in Chicago.

00:13:39.930 --> 00:13:43.900
I felt just amazing after I finished
that talk and I was thinking,

00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:47.110
if I just got mad and
went off and said,

00:13:47.110 --> 00:13:48.740
"No, I'm not going
to worry about this,

00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:52.110
or if I had decided this isn't
important enough to me to want

00:13:52.110 --> 00:13:55.410
to be part of it,
then I wouldn't have done it."

00:13:55.410 --> 00:13:59.540
As a result, I've given over half
a dozen talks on the platform.

00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:02.550
I've talked to school kids
from elementary school

00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:04.900
to high school all
over the country.

00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:08.390
I even recently received
an award from them

00:14:08.390 --> 00:14:11.560
for the talks I've given
and all of that stuff.

00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:15.870
Now that I'm working at being a
speaker, all that stuff comes back

00:14:15.870 --> 00:14:19.290
to me now where I can
say, "Hey, I spoke

00:14:19.290 --> 00:14:20.680
to all these different
school kids."

00:14:22.710 --> 00:14:25.760
Without letting these people
know what my problem was

00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:28.000
and giving them an opportunity
to fix it, I would have been able

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:29.460
to use the platform.

00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:33.230
Now on the other side, though,
is while we were doing it

00:14:33.230 --> 00:14:36.180
through what people would
call a hacker workaround,

00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:39.500
they had their people working on the
back end to make it more accessible.

00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:44.300
Now there is a single part of their
platform that isn't accessible.

00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:48.350
They did just merge with another
company called Pathful so perhaps

00:14:48.350 --> 00:14:51.480
as they merge the two systems,
there'll be a few hiccups,

00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:56.410
but they understand my needs and
the needs of other people like me.

00:14:56.410 --> 00:14:57.834
The other thing that's
been really cool

00:14:57.834 --> 00:15:01.370
is they have started an initiative

00:15:01.370 --> 00:15:04.498
to really invest in including
more people with disabilities

00:15:04.499 --> 00:15:05.540
on both ends.

00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:09.380
They want more schools for the
blind and other institutions

00:15:09.380 --> 00:15:12.745
that have young people with
disabilities to be able

00:15:12.745 --> 00:15:15.590
to have access
to these classroom lectures.

00:15:15.590 --> 00:15:19.400
They also want to find more people
with disabilities to give talks

00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:22.300
because they realize there
are literally thousands of us

00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:24.769
that have expertise,
that have experience,

00:15:24.769 --> 00:15:28.728
that have lived experience that
could help teach these kids,

00:15:28.728 --> 00:15:31.170
and they value that.

00:15:32.064 --> 00:15:36.630
That was my first experience
with Deborah's, and like I said,

00:15:36.630 --> 00:15:42.220
it took a lot of communication,
understanding communication,

00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:43.790
and they've gotten there.

00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:45.340
Now I'd say they're
probably one example.

00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:52.750
Another experience I had was
with a company called PodMatch,

00:15:52.750 --> 00:15:57.150
which is a place where people can
find podcasts that want to book them

00:15:57.150 --> 00:16:00.850
on their shows and it runs
through artificial intelligence.

00:16:00.850 --> 00:16:04.290
When I first started using
it, it had two issues.

00:16:04.290 --> 00:16:07.770
The first issue was unlabeled
buttons and unlabeled links.

00:16:07.770 --> 00:16:12.570
We've all been there where you
end up having to count links

00:16:12.570 --> 00:16:15.530
just like you would count
steps back in the old TV shows

00:16:15.530 --> 00:16:19.090
or movies in order to figure
out, if I press this link,

00:16:19.090 --> 00:16:20.240
I get this page.

00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:26.130
In this case, I had actually met the
owner before he started the company

00:16:26.130 --> 00:16:27.680
and we had been friends.

00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:31.440
I reached out to him and I
said, "This is a real problem,"

00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:32.810
and we talked about it.

00:16:33.870 --> 00:16:36.550
Even though his company has
been growing really rapidly,

00:16:36.550 --> 00:16:39.120
he's been working hard
to get the tech people

00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:43.720
to make more accessibility
improvements and also to fix

00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:46.190
some of the stuff that
was already there.

00:16:46.190 --> 00:16:49.530
The other part of dealing with
him is I learned a new expression,

00:16:49.530 --> 00:16:51.960
I learned about something
called workflow.

00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:55.260
I'm sure a lot of you are familiar
with this but maybe aren't.

00:16:55.260 --> 00:17:01.180
The thing is, sometimes a problem
with a website is accessibility,

00:17:01.180 --> 00:17:04.610
but sometimes a problem
with the website is workflow

00:17:04.610 --> 00:17:09.080
because the person who
designed it doesn't understand

00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:12.850
how a visually impaired
person navigates a website

00:17:12.850 --> 00:17:17.043
or they don't understand what a
logical process would look like

00:17:17.044 --> 00:17:18.440
to you.

00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:25.880
In this case, he has a system,
a series of buttons that you push

00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:29.760
in order to book a conversation
with somebody on the website.

00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:33.230
I could never find the
button that I needed,

00:17:33.230 --> 00:17:37.870
but I finally noticed that
near that button was a button,

00:17:37.870 --> 00:17:41.030
or I never found the button,
but I noticed there was a button

00:17:41.030 --> 00:17:43.860
that said Schedule Appointment.

00:17:43.860 --> 00:17:46.980
I clicked that button,
and after I clicked that button,

00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:51.490
another button popped up
that said request connection

00:17:51.490 --> 00:17:55.840
or accept connection, which was
the first step in the process

00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:56.840
of booking an interview.

00:17:58.490 --> 00:18:02.190
As somebody on that side,
on the developer side

00:18:02.190 --> 00:18:05.100
of building this website,
they didn't understand

00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:07.590
that didn't make sense to
me as a screen reader user

00:18:07.590 --> 00:18:10.500
because of how I navigate websites.

00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:11.850
I've had to explain that to him.

00:18:11.850 --> 00:18:15.200
I've also talked to him about
how not having the option

00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:18.650
to click a mouse button is
very troubling for people

00:18:18.650 --> 00:18:21.810
with screen reader users
and that if you're going

00:18:21.810 --> 00:18:27.510
to use mouse clicks, there really
has to be a keyboard command option

00:18:27.510 --> 00:18:28.620
that's an equivalent to it.

00:18:28.620 --> 00:18:32.300
They have to be made available
in a way where I can go somewhere

00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:35.000
and get a list of all those
keyboard commands so that

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.430
when I visit your site,
my experience is friendly and fun

00:18:38.430 --> 00:18:42.880
and I can focus on meeting
people and making the connections

00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:45.740
and booking the interviews,
as opposed to, oh, man,

00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:47.840
what I do next on this website?

00:18:50.570 --> 00:18:54.480
He did take some of my
suggestions and they're continuing

00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:59.150
to invest in the website and
upgrade the accessibility.

00:18:59.150 --> 00:19:02.780
It's just that they are a small
team but that's one of the reasons

00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:05.680
why I'm impressed by them because
we all know there are lots

00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:09.350
of websites being run by huge
companies that are not accessible.

00:19:09.350 --> 00:19:11.110
All we have to do is look
at the headlines to see

00:19:11.110 --> 00:19:13.640
some of the companies that
have been sued for lack

00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:14.860
of Internet accessibility.

00:19:15.990 --> 00:19:19.190
Then the third example I want
to share with you all was

00:19:19.190 --> 00:19:22.510
with the organization
Podcast Movement.

00:19:22.510 --> 00:19:27.680
They run a very prestigious
national conference on podcasting,

00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:31.950
something I wanted to attend
and actually wanted to speak at

00:19:31.950 --> 00:19:35.210
but when I visited the
website and went to the form,

00:19:35.210 --> 00:19:37.310
the form was not accessible.

00:19:37.310 --> 00:19:41.420
There were selection boxes,
but they weren't the kind

00:19:41.420 --> 00:19:43.940
that my screen reader
could navigate easily.

00:19:43.940 --> 00:19:48.750
I couldn't select something
and have it stay where I put it

00:19:48.750 --> 00:19:54.680
and then press Enter or the control
on it and have it select the item.

00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:58.620
I was very disappointed because the
deadline was coming up to apply.

00:19:58.620 --> 00:20:01.440
I reached out to them,
I explained my problem

00:20:02.590 --> 00:20:06.580
and they had somebody export the
application to a Google Docs form.

00:20:07.610 --> 00:20:11.220
Of course, I had to explain to
them, "Hey, Google Docs isn't

00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:13.180
a whole lot more accessible
than your website."

00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:20.870
I was able to export the Google
Docs file to a text file.

00:20:20.870 --> 00:20:24.123
I was able to enter
all my information

00:20:24.123 --> 00:20:27.360
and send it to him in that file.

00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:28.710
He navigated it.

00:20:28.710 --> 00:20:31.080
Entered all my stuff into
the form on the website.

00:20:32.210 --> 00:20:36.750
He also helped me update it so
that I could include my photos

00:20:36.750 --> 00:20:40.400
and my links and the fact
that I want to give a keynote

00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:45.560
if the opportunity comes up for me
to give a keynote plus my workshop.

00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:49.830
The really cool thing about
these guys is they want me

00:20:49.830 --> 00:20:52.640
to let people know that
they did not intentionally,

00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:55.820
try to exclude people
with disabilities.

00:20:55.820 --> 00:20:58.880
They just did not realize
what they were doing.

00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:02.230
I find that quite a lot when I talked
to people about their websites.

00:21:02.230 --> 00:21:05.610
They did not know,
but they did promise me that

00:21:05.610 --> 00:21:09.690
by the next time they have a
call for speakers or a call

00:21:09.690 --> 00:21:13.820
for any type of opportunity,
they will have an accessible form.

00:21:13.820 --> 00:21:16.480
They asked me for my advice and
I told them, "Keep it simple.

00:21:17.550 --> 00:21:20.720
Use a Google form and leverage
the work they've already done

00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:23.930
on accessibility because I've
never run across a Google form

00:21:23.930 --> 00:21:24.930
I couldn't complete."

00:21:25.770 --> 00:21:30.660
These are three examples where
it wasn't because I said,

00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:32.650
"You have to do this, or else."

00:21:32.650 --> 00:21:34.460
I didn't threaten to sue them.

00:21:34.460 --> 00:21:37.170
I didn't threaten to go on
social media and call them out.

00:21:37.170 --> 00:21:40.990
I just said, "Hey, I would really
like to be part of your company

00:21:40.990 --> 00:21:44.920
and use your website and
these are my problems.

00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:48.790
Could you help me?" We
were able to get that done.

00:21:48.790 --> 00:21:55.280
Now, like I say,
it does require that both sides want

00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:58.840
to communicate and collaborate,
and there are going to be times

00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:03.080
where the website owner
basically just blows you off.

00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:04.170
They do ignore you.

00:22:04.170 --> 00:22:05.170
They don't pay attention.

00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:09.320
Sadly, when that happens, then you
have to fall back on compliance.

00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:14.450
My daddy taught me that more
often than not, I can get

00:22:14.450 --> 00:22:19.600
what I want with a smile,
a handshake, and asking nicely

00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:22.620
than I can by telling
people they're a big meaning

00:22:22.620 --> 00:22:24.940
and if they don't do it or
they better do it or else.

00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:29.450
That leads me to something
I have also found out

00:22:29.450 --> 00:22:35.050
from the companies I've spoken with
over the last few months is I like

00:22:35.050 --> 00:22:38.380
to ask people, do you have
any visually impaired people

00:22:38.381 --> 00:22:41.990
using your website
or using your product or service?

00:22:41.990 --> 00:22:45.500
In the last two months,
I've had four conversations

00:22:45.500 --> 00:22:49.540
with that particular question and
every single time the answer is,

00:22:49.540 --> 00:22:50.960
we don't know.

00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:54.020
Then I have to ask them,
"Why don't you know?" Of course,

00:22:54.020 --> 00:22:57.060
I don't say it mean like that,
but I do have to ask them.

00:22:57.060 --> 00:23:02.110
Their answer is always the
same Because no one living

00:23:02.110 --> 00:23:06.550
with vision loss or any other
type of disability ever tells us

00:23:06.550 --> 00:23:07.760
that they're using our product.

00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:11.490
They never go, "Hey, I'm here
and your product is great, or,

00:23:11.490 --> 00:23:15.050
I'm here and your
product is horrible."

00:23:15.050 --> 00:23:17.520
People that I've talked
to say we just don't hear

00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:19.140
from the visually impaired users.

00:23:19.140 --> 00:23:24.020
I would be willing to bet that
that's probably the same for users

00:23:24.020 --> 00:23:26.060
of all types of disabilities.

00:23:26.060 --> 00:23:28.970
Now, I understand that
deciding whether or not

00:23:28.970 --> 00:23:31.770
to tell people you have a
disability is a personal matter.

00:23:31.770 --> 00:23:34.900
I'm not going to say everybody
should do it the way I do it.

00:23:34.900 --> 00:23:40.850
I will say it works the way I do it
and I spend a lot less time cursing

00:23:40.850 --> 00:23:44.620
and pulling up my hair than
I would have otherwise.

00:23:44.620 --> 00:23:48.640
I understand that a lot of
people just want to be able

00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:52.620
to be treated like everybody else
as if they don't have a disability.

00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:53.620
I understand that.

00:23:54.580 --> 00:24:00.160
In this case, though,
I am trying to get things moving.

00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:02.680
I'm trying to get things
to become more accessible.

00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:06.580
I'm really trying to get the
developers on the platform

00:24:06.580 --> 00:24:10.750
and outside the platform
to decide that they want

00:24:10.750 --> 00:24:14.140
to make their websites
accessible and that's fine.

00:24:14.140 --> 00:24:16.780
If it's because they're
scared, that's fine.

00:24:16.780 --> 00:24:19.430
If it's because they have a
real true desire, that's fine.

00:24:19.430 --> 00:24:22.640
If it's because they realize they
can make more money, that's fine.

00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:25.620
I'm just trying to do my part
here to make it easier on them

00:24:25.620 --> 00:24:27.880
because this is hard
and this is scary.

00:24:30.260 --> 00:24:34.850
I've been working with
people, trying to get them

00:24:34.850 --> 00:24:40.850
to make their websites more
accessible based on what I know.

00:24:42.260 --> 00:24:45.400
If you own a company,
you probably are asking yourself,

00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:51.340
what if I don't have the ability
to connect with somebody like Max?

00:24:52.430 --> 00:24:58.420
How do I create this partnership
so that I actually create

00:24:58.420 --> 00:25:01.110
an accessible website
from the beginning

00:25:02.210 --> 00:25:08.010
so that the whole development
process, from the idea to the design

00:25:08.010 --> 00:25:11.180
to the construction,
to the distribution, to the growth

00:25:11.180 --> 00:25:15.830
and updating everything along
that path is up, is accessible

00:25:15.830 --> 00:25:17.660
or updated so that it is?

00:25:17.660 --> 00:25:19.080
How do you do that?

00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:21.380
There are quite a few
places you can go.

00:25:21.380 --> 00:25:26.360
For starters, there are plugins
and other automated overlays

00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:30.520
that you can install on your
website that will offer some level

00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:32.140
of accessibility.

00:25:32.140 --> 00:25:34.610
I'm not going to say that
those things are wrong

00:25:34.611 --> 00:25:35.920
or that they're horrible.

00:25:37.380 --> 00:25:39.810
There are some that are better
than others but if you're going

00:25:39.810 --> 00:25:46.930
to use automation,
please try to find one that is built

00:25:46.930 --> 00:25:52.080
by people that have disabilities
but they have a team,

00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:54.030
or they at least have
a community of people

00:25:54.030 --> 00:25:57.500
where they can know what
the most usual problems are

00:25:57.500 --> 00:26:00.740
and they can adapt for them,
they can develop for them,

00:26:00.740 --> 00:26:03.360
they can figure out how
to update your website.

00:26:04.730 --> 00:26:10.970
If at all possible, an overlay or
a plugin that includes human review

00:26:10.970 --> 00:26:17.360
along with the automated
reviews and updates.

00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:18.470
That's one way you can do it.

00:26:18.470 --> 00:26:24.770
That's easy, that's anonymous,
or at least a closed system

00:26:24.770 --> 00:26:27.010
where only a certain group of
people are going to know about it.

00:26:27.010 --> 00:26:31.650
The other thing you can do
is, while we are scattered,

00:26:31.650 --> 00:26:36.030
and there are lots of us,
there are various advocacy groups

00:26:36.030 --> 00:26:39.790
in the country that have people.

00:26:39.790 --> 00:26:43.470
Some places it's a team,
some places its email list,

00:26:43.470 --> 00:26:45.280
but they have people
that you can reach out

00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:47.639
to who can give you feedback

00:26:47.639 --> 00:26:49.730
on whether or not your
website is accessible.

00:26:50.950 --> 00:26:54.730
I would recommend groups,
I'm not going to mention the group

00:26:54.730 --> 00:27:01.880
by name because I don't really
want to start any disagreements

00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:07.670
over which websites I mentioned
and if I leave somebody out.

00:27:07.670 --> 00:27:10.260
You can do a Google search
and you can find those groups

00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:13.070
that can help you see if your
website or product is accessible

00:27:13.070 --> 00:27:15.180
and give you ideas
on how to fix it.

00:27:15.180 --> 00:27:18.680
The next thing you can do is
you can create a team in-house.

00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:22.560
It doesn't have to be a huge team,
it does have to be a paid team.

00:27:24.610 --> 00:27:27.090
As for what you would pay
them, I'll leave that up to you

00:27:27.090 --> 00:27:30.490
and them to negotiate but it would
be great if you had an internal team

00:27:30.490 --> 00:27:33.250
of people representing
multiple disabilities

00:27:33.250 --> 00:27:36.140
who could give you regular
feedback on what you're developing

00:27:36.140 --> 00:27:37.990
and how accessible it is or is not.

00:27:39.140 --> 00:27:41.891
Also give you their
opinions on workflow,

00:27:41.892 --> 00:27:43.790
on does the way you interact

00:27:43.790 --> 00:27:46.830
with the website make sense
in addition to accessibility?

00:27:46.830 --> 00:27:49.760
Because as I mentioned earlier,
those are two separate things,

00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:54.350
but they're both a big part
of whether somebody can enjoy

00:27:54.350 --> 00:27:55.350
using your website.

00:27:57.090 --> 00:28:00.990
In addition to that,
make it easy for people

00:28:00.990 --> 00:28:04.670
to contact your technical
support and your developer team.

00:28:04.670 --> 00:28:08.850
I understand that you don't want
those people getting hundreds

00:28:08.850 --> 00:28:13.320
or thousands of emails,
but possibly a place

00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:20.640
where the emails you do get can
be curated into a bullet list

00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:24.520
of the most common concerns and
then passed on to developers.

00:28:25.690 --> 00:28:27.360
Reach out to individual users.

00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:31.850
If you are on the internet, you can
see people that are doing great work.

00:28:31.850 --> 00:28:35.760
You just have to Google The Blind
Blogger or What's Your Excuse?

00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:37.220
You're going to find Max Ivey.

00:28:37.220 --> 00:28:41.690
There are lots of other very talented
creators who have disabilities,

00:28:41.690 --> 00:28:46.760
podcasters, authors, speakers,
YouTubers, Instagrammers.

00:28:48.050 --> 00:28:52.470
You can easily find people with
disabilities and you can invite them

00:28:52.470 --> 00:28:53.720
to give you their opinion.

00:28:55.050 --> 00:28:58.490
Perhaps you all can work out
some affiliate arrangement

00:28:58.490 --> 00:29:00.990
or an endorsement
schedule or something

00:29:00.990 --> 00:29:04.020
to where both sides get
something out of it.

00:29:04.020 --> 00:29:07.420
Try to find ways for people
like me to contact you

00:29:07.420 --> 00:29:12.670
so we can share our concerns
and consider reaching out

00:29:12.670 --> 00:29:15.270
to people like me, like many
of the people that are going

00:29:15.270 --> 00:29:19.470
to speak during this accessibility
day and going, "Hey, we would love

00:29:19.470 --> 00:29:21.100
for you to give us your input.

00:29:21.100 --> 00:29:23.420
By the way, I just had an idea."

00:29:23.420 --> 00:29:28.200
Go to the list of speakers and
just take down all of our names

00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:31.250
and those who aren't
interested can say no.

00:29:31.250 --> 00:29:33.720
Those who aren't interested
can send me a message offline

00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:35.910
and tell me thanks but no thanks.

00:29:35.910 --> 00:29:37.510
I hope I didn't just
make somebody mad.

00:29:37.510 --> 00:29:41.380
When ideas like that occur to
me, I generally speak them.

00:29:41.380 --> 00:29:43.630
There are lots of people
speaking at this event

00:29:43.630 --> 00:29:46.470
who would be perfect for
you to ask for our help,

00:29:46.470 --> 00:29:49.050
to make your products more
accessible and to avoid,

00:29:50.300 --> 00:29:53.460
breaking things in a way
that creates hard feelings

00:29:53.460 --> 00:29:56.680
and makes it hard for you to
put it back the way it was.

00:29:56.680 --> 00:30:01.380
Again, make it easy for
people to connect with you.

00:30:02.450 --> 00:30:06.800
Make it so that we don't
have to own the product.

00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:10.800
We don't have to have a subscription,
we don't have to have spent money.

00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:12.530
Just make it so we
can reach out and go,

00:30:12.530 --> 00:30:15.810
"Hey, I didn't even get
past the signup screen

00:30:15.810 --> 00:30:20.320
and I already had trouble or I signed
up but I'm not enjoying my use.

00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:22.480
Is it possible you could
address this, this, and this?"

00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:25.420
Make it easy for us
to connect with you.

00:30:25.420 --> 00:30:28.930
On my website the last
thing I want anybody to do

00:30:28.930 --> 00:30:32.920
if they're thinking about hiring a
public speaker or hiring a publicist,

00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:35.260
the last thing I want anybody
to have to do is to have

00:30:35.260 --> 00:30:38.820
to dig to find my email
address or my contact form.

00:30:38.820 --> 00:30:40.800
I want them to be able
to find me right away.

00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:45.620
As a business owner considering
how valuable accessibility can be

00:30:45.620 --> 00:30:50.010
to you, I wish more would think
I don't want to make it hard

00:30:50.010 --> 00:30:52.010
for people with
disabilities to let me know

00:30:52.010 --> 00:30:53.180
that we could make this better.

00:30:55.460 --> 00:31:00.930
Advocacy groups, internal staffs
reaching out to influencers

00:31:00.930 --> 00:31:03.930
or other people asking your staff
member if they know any people

00:31:03.930 --> 00:31:05.950
with disabilities they
can introduce you to.

00:31:07.150 --> 00:31:10.760
Attending events like this where
you can meet people and decide,

00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:13.940
"Hey, I'd like to know that person
and have them be part of our team."

00:31:13.940 --> 00:31:15.760
That's all great stuff.

00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:21.370
If you build it and you
maintain it with accessibility,

00:31:21.370 --> 00:31:23.910
then it takes a lot less
work once you get started.

00:31:25.570 --> 00:31:28.640
I really hope that this
is making sense to y'all

00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:32.780
and y'all are realizing that we
can make our stuff accessible

00:31:32.780 --> 00:31:34.370
if we want to.

00:31:34.370 --> 00:31:37.410
Then if we decide to do
it, we have the potential

00:31:37.410 --> 00:31:41.430
to reach new audiences that
are going to stay with us

00:31:41.430 --> 00:31:44.100
as long as we continue to
make them feel welcome.

00:31:44.100 --> 00:31:49.450
I hope that does help you some
and really it is a partnership.

00:31:50.820 --> 00:31:54.440
I could not do what I do
without WordPress doing

00:31:54.440 --> 00:31:57.140
what they've done over
the last 11 or 12 years.

00:31:57.140 --> 00:32:03.950
I think this is their 12th year
now because while I could use one

00:32:03.950 --> 00:32:08.860
of the other content management
system websites, none of them are

00:32:08.860 --> 00:32:12.310
as much fun to use as WordPress.

00:32:12.310 --> 00:32:16.610
If you notice there I said fun
because I don't like to have to think

00:32:16.610 --> 00:32:20.290
about what I need to do next
in order to update my website

00:32:20.290 --> 00:32:22.700
or create a new blog
post or upload a video.

00:32:22.700 --> 00:32:27.230
I would like to be able to go
step, step, step without having

00:32:27.230 --> 00:32:28.400
to think about it at all.

00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:32.440
I just want you to think about it.

00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:38.820
I don't expect you all to do it
but I really hope that you do.

00:32:39.990 --> 00:32:44.230
After hearing me speak you
decide, I would like to try

00:32:44.230 --> 00:32:49.090
to make my website more
accessible, then I'd like to hear

00:32:49.090 --> 00:32:50.980
what you do to make that happen.

00:32:52.590 --> 00:32:55.900
Be more than happy to
provide any advice opinions

00:32:55.900 --> 00:32:58.820
or suggestions I can to
anybody that sincerely wants

00:32:58.820 --> 00:33:01.580
to make their stuff better
and make it more inclusive.

00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:10.550
Whether you're a big
company, a small company,

00:33:10.550 --> 00:33:13.480
sole entrepreneur
there are always ways

00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:18.600
to accomplish the difficult things
and accessibility is no different

00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:21.570
than trying to
locate new customers.

00:33:21.570 --> 00:33:26.240
Coming up with an elevator pitch,
building an e-commerce store,

00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:28.450
or any of the other stuff we
have to do in order to try

00:33:28.450 --> 00:33:29.450
to make money online.

00:33:33.430 --> 00:33:37.430
If I have time, I would like
to share just one more example

00:33:37.430 --> 00:33:39.390
because it comes from
a very small company.

00:33:40.470 --> 00:33:43.390
It comes from a company called
Less Annoying CRM which stands

00:33:43.390 --> 00:33:46.220
for client relationship management.

00:33:46.220 --> 00:33:48.930
I'm very big on business
through creating

00:33:48.930 --> 00:33:52.370
and maintaining relationships
as opposed to selling.

00:33:52.370 --> 00:33:55.260
I send out a lot of emails
and make a lot of phone calls

00:33:55.260 --> 00:33:58.180
and it's hard to keep track
of everything I've done.

00:33:58.180 --> 00:34:00.890
I've looked for accessible
programs and couldn't find one

00:34:00.890 --> 00:34:03.000
and it turned out
that they offer one.

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:05.920
It's very friendly,
very accessible.

00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:10.470
The thing is this company
only has 19 employees

00:34:10.470 --> 00:34:13.390
yet their product competes with
Salesforce that has thousands

00:34:13.390 --> 00:34:14.940
of employees.

00:34:14.940 --> 00:34:17.020
This company only makes $3 million.

00:34:17.020 --> 00:34:18.910
I'm fixing to say only
makes $3 million a year

00:34:18.910 --> 00:34:23.320
or grosses $3 million a year
which I'm told is less than 1%

00:34:23.320 --> 00:34:24.540
of what Salesforce makes.

00:34:26.210 --> 00:34:29.750
Their website is clean,
it's uncluttered, it's friendly.

00:34:30.770 --> 00:34:33.780
Even though they have to use
a drag and drop they went out

00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:37.840
and found an accessible drag
and drop to include in the part

00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:41.680
of the website where you create your
workflows for your own internal use.

00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:44.200
It can be done.

00:34:45.170 --> 00:34:48.840
Please don't let the size of your
company, please don't let your lack

00:34:48.840 --> 00:34:53.000
of ability or skills be
an excuse to keep you

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:55.230
from making your
website accessible.

00:34:55.230 --> 00:34:59.475
Just remember, the more fun
it is used the more people

00:34:59.476 --> 00:35:00.890
that will use it.

00:35:00.890 --> 00:35:05.640
The more people with disabilities
believe we are included

00:35:05.640 --> 00:35:08.070
the more money you have
the potential to make.

00:35:08.070 --> 00:35:12.611
Since I'm hearing voices in my
background that means I'm through.

00:35:12.611 --> 00:35:13.974
>> DANIELLE: You got
about five minutes left

00:35:13.975 --> 00:35:15.710
if you still had more to say.

00:35:16.188 --> 00:35:17.619
>> MAXWELL: No, I think I'm good.

00:35:19.351 --> 00:35:21.820
My speaking coach always
says Max if you get to

00:35:21.820 --> 00:35:24.310
where you think you're
through then stop

00:35:24.310 --> 00:35:27.310
and give them a few more
minutes of question and answer.

00:35:27.310 --> 00:35:29.990
>> DANIELLE: That's
valuable advice for sure.

00:35:29.990 --> 00:35:33.632
I kept having questions to ask you
and then you kept answering them.

00:35:33.632 --> 00:35:34.210
[laughter]

00:35:34.210 --> 00:35:35.970
It was an excellent presentation.

00:35:37.002 --> 00:35:37.630
>> MAXWELL: Thank you.

00:35:37.630 --> 00:35:39.160
I was really concerned about it.

00:35:39.160 --> 00:35:41.310
I have had these
conversations with a lot

00:35:41.310 --> 00:35:43.940
of people over the last few
years but this is the first time

00:35:43.940 --> 00:35:48.220
I've given this talk and I
will say that I was nervous

00:35:48.220 --> 00:35:50.450
because there are people who
wouldn't believe me if I did

00:35:50.450 --> 00:35:54.770
but I was at least concerned
that I was giving a talk

00:35:54.770 --> 00:35:57.720
for the first time to an
audience I really care about

00:35:57.720 --> 00:35:59.960
and really wanted to do well for.

00:35:59.960 --> 00:36:02.400
>> DANIELLE: You can tell.

00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:05.620
We do have one question
so far that came in.

00:36:05.620 --> 00:36:09.580
They said I love your approach that
you help website owners do better

00:36:09.580 --> 00:36:13.190
with a smile and a
handshake but will you share

00:36:13.190 --> 00:36:16.460
what is the single most frustrating
thing that you encounter

00:36:16.460 --> 00:36:20.720
on websites and what would be
a better experience for you?

00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:23.330
>> MAXWELL: I appreciate that because
that sounds like that's coming

00:36:23.330 --> 00:36:28.010
from a developer or a website
owner who wants to know.

00:36:29.820 --> 00:36:33.610
I would say the most aggravating
thing that happens to me is

00:36:33.610 --> 00:36:38.250
when I go to a website to fill
out a lot of form and the forms

00:36:38.250 --> 00:36:42.780
either aren't labeled or
the label is off to the side

00:36:42.780 --> 00:36:44.770
and it isn't connected
to the field.

00:36:45.810 --> 00:36:48.570
Just to explain this for
somebody who isn't really sure

00:36:48.570 --> 00:36:49.750
what I'm talking about here.

00:36:49.750 --> 00:36:52.500
When you use the screen
reader, your general ways

00:36:52.500 --> 00:36:56.360
of navigating the screen
are tab and shift-tab.

00:36:56.360 --> 00:37:00.190
In a perfect world,
a form would announce the field

00:37:00.190 --> 00:37:05.270
along with any instructions for
that field as you come to it.

00:37:05.270 --> 00:37:09.420
If I press tab and the first field
wants my first name it should say,

00:37:09.420 --> 00:37:12.290
first name but quite
often it doesn't.

00:37:12.290 --> 00:37:15.760
It'll just say edit or blank
or empty or something along

00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:18.580
and I will have to use my
arrow keys and go word by word

00:37:18.580 --> 00:37:23.430
or line by line to find where I
need to put the information in.

00:37:24.710 --> 00:37:28.190
If you're using a form be
sure to test your form.

00:37:28.190 --> 00:37:32.050
Have somebody who uses a screen
reader, test it for you make sure

00:37:32.050 --> 00:37:33.590
that it's not just accessible.

00:37:33.590 --> 00:37:36.050
As I said earlier there could
be things that are accessible

00:37:36.050 --> 00:37:40.230
that are not workable that
have poor workflow designs.

00:37:40.230 --> 00:37:44.370
If you're using a form habit tested
send it to somebody and ask them

00:37:44.370 --> 00:37:45.780
if they'll fill it in
for you and tell them

00:37:45.780 --> 00:37:47.960
if they do you'll give them a
social media shoutout or something

00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:49.300
to make it worth their while.

00:37:50.669 --> 00:37:52.190
>> DANIELLE: A
little discount code.

00:37:52.190 --> 00:37:53.050
>> MAXWELL: There you go.

00:37:53.050 --> 00:37:55.340
A discount code exactly.

00:37:56.590 --> 00:37:58.390
Beyond that just to
finish off the thought

00:37:58.390 --> 00:38:01.660
about forms the other thing
that just really ticks me off

00:38:01.660 --> 00:38:04.690
and I don't get mad
about much is if I manage

00:38:04.690 --> 00:38:07.360
to make my way to the
end of the form, and then

00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:11.130
for some reason the way they
have coded the submit button,

00:38:11.130 --> 00:38:12.670
I cannot press it.

00:38:12.670 --> 00:38:14.580
I can't tell you how
aggravating it is

00:38:14.580 --> 00:38:17.000
and the longer the form
is the madder I get.

00:38:18.897 --> 00:38:20.465
You've been there too, yes?

00:38:20.465 --> 00:38:22.200
>> DANIELLE: Yes.

00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:25.850
I am a web developer so
I test very many forms

00:38:25.850 --> 00:38:28.220
and I do not enjoy it at all.

00:38:29.260 --> 00:38:32.420
>> MAXWELL: That's one of
the worst and especially

00:38:32.420 --> 00:38:36.430
because you're already invested
and it's also the worst

00:38:36.430 --> 00:38:39.340
for the website developer
because think about it this way.

00:38:39.340 --> 00:38:44.070
If I spend that time and get
to the end and I do reach out

00:38:44.070 --> 00:38:48.090
to you which there is no
guarantee I will reach out to you

00:38:48.090 --> 00:38:52.830
and if I do there's no guarantee
I won't use some negative language

00:38:52.830 --> 00:38:53.830
let's say.

00:38:54.730 --> 00:38:57.140
Think about it from
this point of view

00:38:57.140 --> 00:39:01.390
of your folks wouldn't it be easier
for your folks to get an email

00:39:01.390 --> 00:39:05.490
from somebody that wasn't already
wound up over an issue like this?

00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:11.520
It's in your best interest to test
the website form or anything else

00:39:11.520 --> 00:39:15.330
on your website because
you eliminate aggravation.

00:39:15.330 --> 00:39:17.300
You avoid hurt feelings.

00:39:17.300 --> 00:39:22.520
Trust me if any of you have watched
any of these police incidents

00:39:22.520 --> 00:39:24.640
that escalate quite
often they escalate

00:39:24.640 --> 00:39:26.760
because the people
involved are already upset.

00:39:28.690 --> 00:39:34.970
As a webmaster, we really want to
try to avoid making people upset

00:39:34.970 --> 00:39:37.620
without thinking about
it or for no good reason.

00:39:37.620 --> 00:39:42.190
I'd really have to be convinced
what their good reason would be

00:39:42.190 --> 00:39:43.600
to break something like the form.

00:39:45.230 --> 00:39:48.870
You're basically just saving
your team a bunch of aggravation.

00:39:48.870 --> 00:39:50.630
You may even be protecting.

00:39:50.630 --> 00:39:53.820
Actually, you could even
be protecting your brand

00:39:53.820 --> 00:39:59.240
by avoiding things like broken
forms and missing alt tags and links

00:39:59.240 --> 00:40:02.110
that I don't know are there because
they have no alt information.

00:40:02.110 --> 00:40:05.970
My screen reader can't find
the link so these things,

00:40:05.970 --> 00:40:09.320
they're small things
individually, but they add up.

00:40:09.320 --> 00:40:13.970
They're cabled up,
they show disrespect, and the more

00:40:13.970 --> 00:40:18.410
of them there are on your website,
your blog, your podcast player,

00:40:18.410 --> 00:40:22.970
et cetera, the more likely it is that
your tech support people are going

00:40:22.970 --> 00:40:25.290
to get a phone call or
they're going to get an email

00:40:25.290 --> 00:40:28.380
and they're going to walk away from
their computer and throw something

00:40:28.380 --> 00:40:31.290
or go to the break room and
get coffee because it's like,

00:40:31.290 --> 00:40:32.563
"Man, what did I do?"

00:40:32.563 --> 00:40:36.601
>> DANIELLE: [laughs]

00:40:36.601 --> 00:40:38.290
No, that's a great point.

00:40:38.290 --> 00:40:41.750
I'm really curious how
certain things would perform,

00:40:41.750 --> 00:40:46.720
like Save As You Go and other
things if you're having trouble

00:40:46.720 --> 00:40:51.000
with this form thing, I wonder
how those can be implemented

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:53.440
to aid rather than interrupt too.

00:40:53.440 --> 00:40:57.230
>> MAXWELL: I love Save As You Go,
but there are a couple of issues

00:40:57.230 --> 00:40:58.550
with it for a screen reader user.

00:40:58.550 --> 00:41:04.310
One is I need to have a way
of knowing that it's in play

00:41:04.310 --> 00:41:08.820
and a way to know when was
the last time it updated

00:41:08.820 --> 00:41:12.420
because quite often with
those Save As You Go things,

00:41:12.420 --> 00:41:15.109
they don't report to the
notifications settings

00:41:15.109 --> 00:41:17.909
on my screen reader to tell me
that something just popped up

00:41:17.909 --> 00:41:19.460
on the screen.

00:41:19.460 --> 00:41:25.270
Knowing that it's being saved or
having the last saved time marker

00:41:25.270 --> 00:41:28.990
that most of them use next to
the submit button would be,

00:41:28.990 --> 00:41:30.140
are very helpful things.

00:41:30.140 --> 00:41:32.910
Just make it easy for me to
know if it's being saved or not

00:41:32.910 --> 00:41:36.610
and then be able to find the place
on the screen where I can see

00:41:36.610 --> 00:41:38.330
how long ago did it save it.

00:41:39.610 --> 00:41:42.220
Another thing that's really
good, and this is, in addition,

00:41:42.220 --> 00:41:45.400
to Save As You Go
is-- I can't tell you

00:41:45.400 --> 00:41:49.670
how many times I fill out a form
and I don't get an error message

00:41:49.670 --> 00:41:54.240
and I press submit, everything
goes, but it never tells me

00:41:54.240 --> 00:41:55.380
that I was successful.

00:41:55.380 --> 00:41:56.670
It doesn't say thank you.

00:41:56.670 --> 00:41:58.770
It doesn't say your
submission was received.

00:41:58.770 --> 00:41:59.940
It doesn't say, nothing.

00:42:01.360 --> 00:42:04.680
Sometimes I can go to the URL
and at the end of the URL,

00:42:04.680 --> 00:42:07.490
you can see where
the URL has changed

00:42:07.490 --> 00:42:11.800
because your submission went through
but most of the time you can't.

00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:16.320
If they don't send you a
confirmation email, because a lot

00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:19.840
of them don't automatically do
that, and a lot of them don't have

00:42:19.840 --> 00:42:24.750
that check box to select,
to have a copy set to yourself.

00:42:24.750 --> 00:42:28.430
If you don't know that it's done
you have two choices, you can

00:42:28.430 --> 00:42:30.510
either sit there and wait.

00:42:30.510 --> 00:42:33.150
You can try entering
the information again.

00:42:33.150 --> 00:42:35.310
You can get mad and leave.

00:42:35.310 --> 00:42:38.820
There really aren't good
outcomes for the other person

00:42:38.820 --> 00:42:41.890
if I don't know what I'm
doing based on the information

00:42:41.890 --> 00:42:44.870
that I can find on the screen and
of course, with a screen reader

00:42:44.870 --> 00:42:48.399
that is text characters,
that is images

00:42:48.399 --> 00:42:50.200
that have been assigned alt text,

00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:54.200
those are buttons that have been
assigned alt text, those are links

00:42:54.200 --> 00:42:58.290
that have been actually given
names instead of an unnamed link.

00:43:00.500 --> 00:43:07.040
I love Save As especially on
websites like I'm part of SpeakerHub,

00:43:07.040 --> 00:43:10.610
which is a great site for finding
opportunities to give talks.

00:43:10.610 --> 00:43:13.620
In fact, that's how I found that
you all were holding this event.

00:43:13.620 --> 00:43:17.940
It's a really cool place but their
Save As is one of those things.

00:43:17.940 --> 00:43:21.970
Half the time I end up and
I've talked to them about this,

00:43:21.970 --> 00:43:25.870
but they're based in another country
but half the time after I'm through,

00:43:25.870 --> 00:43:28.940
I send them an email, I go,
"Hey, I just did this, and this.

00:43:28.940 --> 00:43:30.200
Did it actually get done?

00:43:30.200 --> 00:43:31.110
Because I can't tell."

00:43:32.076 --> 00:43:33.940
>> DANIELLE: Having good
support is important.

00:43:35.510 --> 00:43:40.610
We have a quick question and then we
have another more in-depth question.

00:43:40.610 --> 00:43:42.720
We're going to try to
get through them quick.

00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:48.050
We have what Screen Reader technology
do you use most often and why?

00:43:48.050 --> 00:43:49.300
That's our first.

00:43:49.300 --> 00:43:54.010
>> MAXWELL: It depends on what
I'm trying to do because my Mac

00:43:54.010 --> 00:43:57.110
and my iOS devices display
things differently.

00:43:57.110 --> 00:44:01.640
In some cases it'll work good on the
Mac, but not on the iPad or iPhone.

00:44:01.640 --> 00:44:05.810
In other cases, it'll work good
on the iPhone but not on the Mac.

00:44:05.810 --> 00:44:09.360
Generally, social media works
better on my iOS devices,

00:44:09.360 --> 00:44:13.270
and generally, more complicated
websites work better on my desktop.

00:44:15.370 --> 00:44:19.210
Thanks to Computers for the Blind,
I also have a Windows computer

00:44:19.210 --> 00:44:20.530
that I use.

00:44:20.530 --> 00:44:25.910
I'm using it actually right now
because Stream Yard doesn't play well

00:44:25.910 --> 00:44:26.831
with my Mac.

00:44:26.831 --> 00:44:27.720
>> DANIELLE: Got it.

00:44:28.533 --> 00:44:29.620
>> MAXWELL: Sorry about the answer.

00:44:29.620 --> 00:44:30.190
It was a little.

00:44:30.190 --> 00:44:32.470
>> DANIELLE: I wonder
if Windows works better

00:44:32.470 --> 00:44:35.830
for government sites since
they're usually more outdated.

00:44:35.830 --> 00:44:38.240
>> MAXWELL: I try to stay
off of government sites,

00:44:38.240 --> 00:44:39.700
but I think you're onto something

00:44:39.700 --> 00:44:41.720
>> DANIELLE: [laughs]

00:44:41.720 --> 00:44:46.960
Our next question is do you
use the classic editor plugin

00:44:46.960 --> 00:44:49.910
in WordPress or the block
editor to write posts?

00:44:49.910 --> 00:44:53.230
If there was a list of top things
you would like to see fixed

00:44:53.230 --> 00:44:56.040
in the admin,
what would be on that list?

00:44:56.040 --> 00:44:59.440
>> MAXWELL: I'm going to start by
saying something that may appear

00:44:59.440 --> 00:45:02.280
to be negative about
WordPress, but it's honest.

00:45:02.280 --> 00:45:05.720
That's my number one
guiding principle.

00:45:05.720 --> 00:45:08.430
I was not happy when
Gutenberg came around

00:45:08.430 --> 00:45:11.270
and we started adding all
this block editor stuff.

00:45:11.270 --> 00:45:15.520
I do run the classic
editor on my websites.

00:45:15.520 --> 00:45:19.630
Unfortunately, one of my websites
is been out there so long

00:45:19.630 --> 00:45:22.713
that even when I run
the classic editor,

00:45:22.714 --> 00:45:25.120
the block stuff still shows up.

00:45:25.120 --> 00:45:27.860
I have figured out how to
navigate the block stuff.

00:45:27.860 --> 00:45:34.250
I don't mind having to use the move
block up and move block down buttons.

00:45:34.250 --> 00:45:40.730
I've even figured out that if I
stop using double-line returns,

00:45:40.730 --> 00:45:45.730
then it'll stop adding paragraphs
when I where I don't want them.

00:45:45.730 --> 00:45:48.890
In general, I'm very happy that
they added the option of going back

00:45:48.890 --> 00:45:50.610
to the classic editor.

00:45:50.610 --> 00:45:54.080
I think for most people
that are running a one-page

00:45:54.080 --> 00:45:58.020
or less than five-page website
through their WordPress account,

00:45:58.020 --> 00:46:02.750
that classic editor is the
best simplest way to do it.

00:46:02.750 --> 00:46:05.310
Of course, you have to decide
on what plugins you're going

00:46:05.310 --> 00:46:07.120
to use beyond the classic editor.

00:46:08.520 --> 00:46:12.270
I'm still very happy with
WordPress because trust me,

00:46:12.270 --> 00:46:17.580
I coded my own code for seven
years and I still have nightmares.

00:46:17.580 --> 00:46:20.210
I'm very happy with WordPress.

00:46:20.210 --> 00:46:22.830
>> DANIELLE: You're optimistic
in the direction it's taking.

00:46:22.830 --> 00:46:26.510
If there were stuff that you
want to see fixed, what would be

00:46:26.510 --> 00:46:27.510
on that list?

00:46:28.260 --> 00:46:36.240
>> MAXWELL: I would say maybe
limiting or decreasing the number

00:46:36.240 --> 00:46:39.600
of items on the same
screen together.

00:46:39.600 --> 00:46:41.310
I find that one of the
things that bothers me

00:46:41.310 --> 00:46:44.970
as a screen reader user is
when I have too many options

00:46:44.970 --> 00:46:47.520
on the same screen together.

00:46:47.520 --> 00:46:51.240
For example,
when I open my WordPress dashboard,

00:46:51.240 --> 00:46:55.420
there's always the thanks
for using WordPress.

00:46:57.090 --> 00:47:00.650
There's stuff off to the top
left and the bottom right.

00:47:00.650 --> 00:47:07.100
I don't have a need to see as
I'm editing a post or a page.

00:47:07.100 --> 00:47:10.200
I'm thinking if there was a
way maybe a classic editor

00:47:10.200 --> 00:47:16.690
where I could press a key
command to just show me the stuff

00:47:16.690 --> 00:47:21.140
that's in play for what I'm doing,
I think that would be really cool

00:47:21.140 --> 00:47:24.210
because when you're using a screen
reader, the more objects there are

00:47:24.210 --> 00:47:27.550
on the screen, the longer it
takes you to find what you want

00:47:27.550 --> 00:47:32.100
to find and the longer it takes
you to navigate back and forth

00:47:32.100 --> 00:47:33.430
between those things.

00:47:33.430 --> 00:47:36.730
For example, I have a podcast.

00:47:36.730 --> 00:47:40.730
I produce a podcast and I've
helped other people start podcasts.

00:47:40.730 --> 00:47:45.200
I have the power press player
from blueberry.com installed

00:47:45.201 --> 00:47:46.690
on my websites.

00:47:46.690 --> 00:47:47.390
It works great.

00:47:47.390 --> 00:47:50.650
It's very accessible both on the
back end and when people come

00:47:50.650 --> 00:47:52.610
to listen to the podcast.

00:47:52.610 --> 00:48:00.040
I have to go from the, let's
see, upper third all the way down

00:48:00.040 --> 00:48:02.840
to near the bottom,
and I have to go back

00:48:02.840 --> 00:48:07.030
and forth and back and forth in
order to get the file uploaded

00:48:07.030 --> 00:48:12.330
to Blueberry the URL
from their site verified.

00:48:12.330 --> 00:48:13.880
It's just one of those things.

00:48:13.880 --> 00:48:16.930
If there was less real
estate to navigate,

00:48:16.930 --> 00:48:19.290
that would be a big
improvement in my opinion.

00:48:19.290 --> 00:48:22.280
>> DANIELLE: Back to that workflow
that you were talking about,

00:48:22.280 --> 00:48:25.390
if you do things in order,
put it in the order on the screen

00:48:25.390 --> 00:48:27.040
so you don't have to keep
going back and forth like that.

00:48:29.909 --> 00:48:31.370
>> MAXWELL: Yes.

00:48:31.370 --> 00:48:33.310
>> DANIELLE: We have a
quick follow-up question.

00:48:33.310 --> 00:48:35.220
We have about two minutes left.

00:48:35.220 --> 00:48:39.340
Regarding the screen reader
technology, are you using JAWS, NVDA,

00:48:39.340 --> 00:48:42.300
or the built-in operating
system accessibility tools?

00:48:42.300 --> 00:48:45.440
Now for Mac,
that question is a little different

00:48:45.440 --> 00:48:49.500
because they have different
programs, but are you using something

00:48:49.500 --> 00:48:51.960
that you installed,
or are you using built-in stuff?

00:48:53.415 --> 00:48:57.650
>> MAXWELL: I'm using voiceover
on my Mac, iPhone, iPad,

00:48:57.650 --> 00:48:59.366
which those are built in,

00:48:59.367 --> 00:49:02.730
but I personally think
we gloss over the amount

00:49:02.730 --> 00:49:07.200
of time you invest in configuring
the accessibility options

00:49:07.200 --> 00:49:08.650
to your particular taste.

00:49:10.110 --> 00:49:13.270
Then of course on the Windows
computer, I have played a round

00:49:13.270 --> 00:49:14.520
with Narrator.

00:49:14.520 --> 00:49:16.410
I haven't really been
all that happy with it.

00:49:16.410 --> 00:49:21.750
I think it's because I'm old school,
it hasn't really done anything

00:49:21.750 --> 00:49:22.770
for me.

00:49:22.770 --> 00:49:24.340
I have yet to try NVDA.

00:49:24.340 --> 00:49:29.350
I use JAWS for Windows
and I find it pretty good.

00:49:29.350 --> 00:49:35.200
It's just that sometimes
and this is a Windows thing

00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:37.630
more than a JAWS thing actually,
sometimes it just seems like

00:49:37.630 --> 00:49:41.930
my stuff is always updating
when I don't want it to update.

00:49:43.280 --> 00:49:44.340
>> DANIELLE: Awesome.

00:49:44.340 --> 00:49:48.250
Thank you so much for all
of the information you gave.

00:49:48.250 --> 00:49:50.610
It is all so great.

00:49:50.610 --> 00:49:57.400
Thank you for your perspective
and definitely check out the bio

00:49:57.400 --> 00:50:00.390
that has all of your info
to read more about you.

00:50:00.390 --> 00:50:04.510
It sounds like you have such a
fascinating story and I can't wait

00:50:04.510 --> 00:50:05.380
to read more about you.

00:50:05.380 --> 00:50:06.337
[laughs]

00:50:06.337 --> 00:50:06.690
>> MAXWELL: Thank you.

00:50:06.690 --> 00:50:09.700
I look forward to that,
and when you visit the website

00:50:09.700 --> 00:50:13.480
please send me a message
or send me an email.

00:50:13.480 --> 00:50:15.570
It's just in case
anybody else wants it,

00:50:15.570 --> 00:50:19.880
it's justask@theblindblogger.net
is where people can get me.

00:50:19.880 --> 00:50:23.580
I love having conversations
as I tell people all the time,

00:50:23.580 --> 00:50:26.690
you don't have to want to buy
something from me, you don't have

00:50:26.690 --> 00:50:27.650
to want to book me.

00:50:27.650 --> 00:50:29.780
You don't have to need
to hire me to talk to me

00:50:31.420 --> 00:50:34.160
because I find it quite often,
those friendly conversations

00:50:34.160 --> 00:50:36.910
with no destination turn
out to be the best things.

00:50:36.910 --> 00:50:37.740
>> DANIELLE: Love it.

00:50:37.740 --> 00:50:42.190
Thank you so much and thank you for
attending this session with Max Ivey.

00:50:42.190 --> 00:50:44.800
You can continue the
conversation in the chat

00:50:44.800 --> 00:50:55.619
or on social media using
#WPA11yDay and #WPAD2022.

00:50:55.619 --> 00:50:59.930
