00:00:31.302 --> 00:00:35.450
AMBER HINDS: Hello, and welcome
to WordPress Accessibility Day.

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:37.450
My name is Amber Hinds.

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:40.940
I'm one of the lead organizers
of WordPress Accessibility Day,

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.600
and the CEO of a company
called Equalize Digital.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.400
This session is a lightning round.

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.740
We’re going to have three short
talks that have all been prerecorded.

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:54.040
Our first talk will be
coming from Nick McClure

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.160
and is a Dissertation
Progress Report.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.280
He will be talking about
accessible online content for blind

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.890
and visually impaired users.

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.880
Nick was born and raised in Georgia
and learned American Sign Language

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.850
in high school and has a
bachelor’s of arts in interpreting.

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:16.140
He has been working for about 11
years as a sign language interpreter.

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:21.530
I do believe that Nick...
OK... there is no... sorry.

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:27.150
There is no Q&A for this session...
live Q&A, but we do have

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.220
some of our speakers available,
and I totally lost that in the chat

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:32.290
and I'm sorry [chuckle]

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:32.926
you all.

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:40.460
Feel free to chat in the
conversations and Nick is here.

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.450
Thank you, Joe, behind the
scenes, for keeping me on track.

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:48.850
Nick is here and can answer any
questions in the ideas section

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:49.630
in the chat.

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:56.190
NICK MCCLURE: Hi, everyone.

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:59.030
My name is Nick McClure, and I'm
thrilled to be here with you today.

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:00.030
Thanks for having me.

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:02.390
I'm excited to share with
you just a little bit

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.320
about what I've been
learning about accessibility.

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.760
I'm a nationally certified
sign language interpreter

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.960
and doctoral student pursuing
a degree in instructional

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:15.490
and performance technology; though,
my career the last 15 years has been

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:18.330
as an interpreter and
interpreting professor,

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.150
my dissertation is focusing on
accessibility in a different domain.

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.500
My dissertation is about
how organizations can create

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.110
and share accessible content for
the blind and visually impaired.

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.520
My doctorate program has taught
me how to look at systems

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.300
and look for ways to
improve those systems

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.770
by identifying a problem,
analyzing the environmental

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:41.430
and organizational data, analyzing
the gap between the two sets

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.990
of data, and picking the best
solution based on the data

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:46.970
to help close the gap
and solve the problem.

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.810
This approach to systems
thinking and improvement avoids

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.840
throwing random solutions at a
problem hoping something will work.

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.030
The systems approach to
problem-solving looks at data

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.580
and lets the data
lead the decision.

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:05.170
I want to unpack that just a little
bit as it relates to my dissertation.

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:09.520
Identify that within my
organization content being posted

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:13.260
on our internal communication system
was not accessible to the blind

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:14.260
and visually impaired staff.

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:21.000
This includes pictures,
PDFs, links, gifs, and memes.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.540
Some examples of this may be
in our lost and found channel

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:26.860
where someone may post a
picture in a comment that reads,

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:30.060
Hey, I found these sunglasses
outside in the parking lot.

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.060
Let me know if they’re yours.

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:36.280
The image that's attached
may not be accessible

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:40.520
if the content creator doesn't add
all text or describe the sunglasses

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:42.470
in the body of the text.

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:46.340
Another example I found is a
person created a PDF and posted it

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.320
with the following text, Come
join us for a fun time this Friday

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:51.990
at the Community Conference.

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:54.980
Refer to the PDF below
for more details.

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:58.100
Again, someone using a
screen reader may not be able

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:01.710
to access the PDF if it's not
made assessable and miss out

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:03.000
on the details of the conference.

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:07.580
Research about accessibility
shows that people who are blind

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:10.990
and visually impaired use
workarounds such as asking people

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:13.970
in a shared office space
what the images are.

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:17.480
I find this is the most common
fix within my organization,

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:20.070
but I believe that people should
have the most direct access

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:21.070
to information.

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:24.270
Another interesting topic
in the research suggested

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:27.460
that content should not just
be accessible, but usable

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:31.200
and that by knowing who
the content is created

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:33.700
for will help create the
right type of content.

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:38.450
I mentioned organizational and
environmental analyses earlier.

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:42.290
The organizational
analysis is looking into

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:45.990
what the organization stands
for as described in the policy,

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:50.290
mission, vision, values,
and strategic planning.

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:52.790
I combed through these
documents and was able

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:56.450
to identify that my organization
strives for accessibility for all.

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:00.540
The environmental analysis looks
at what is actually happening

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:03.850
within the organization,
and I found through surveys

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:06.290
and just chatting with people
that a lot of staff think

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:10.210
that making accessible content
is important, but they don't know

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:11.210
how to do it.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.380
My job as a doctoral student
is to work with administration

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:18.170
to pick an intervention
or set of interventions

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:20.680
to help close the gap
between what's happening

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:22.940
and what the
organization strives for.

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:24.890
That's currently where
we are right now.

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:28.600
We are working together to figure
out what interventions will make sure

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:31.490
that all staff will know how
to create accessible content.

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:35.530
The cool thing is that once
people learn how to make

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:39.050
and create accessible content
in one system, they can transfer

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:42.000
that skill to other platforms
and systems, and more

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.170
and more people will be able to
access more and more content.

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:49.610
I'm on track to graduate next
summer, and while I'm looking forward

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:53.000
to that day, I’m enjoying the
process of learning as much as I can

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.230
about others, myself,
and accessibility.

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:58.480
I don't have all of the
answers, but I am passionate

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:00.360
about what I am doing
and look forward to see

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:02.310
how others are impacted.

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:04.090
Thanks for having me
today, and I look forward

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:07.470
to the other talks during
WordPress Accessibility Day 2022.
