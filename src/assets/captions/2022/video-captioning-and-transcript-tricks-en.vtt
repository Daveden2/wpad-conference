<v Host> Video Captioning
and Transcript Tricks

00:00:32.865 --> 00:00:34.639
with Melanie Hawkes.

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.340
Melanie is the video and media
assistant for the Department

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.680
of Fire and Emergency
Services in Western Australia.

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.810
As a reminder, there will be no Q&A
official during this lightning round

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:50.420
but please use the ideas section
to Chat with the other attendees

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.870
and Melanie is here in the Chat
and can answer your questions.

00:00:59.805 --> 00:01:02.028
<v Melanie Hawkes> Hello,
I'm Melanie from the Department

00:01:02.028 --> 00:01:04.932
of Fire and Emergency Services
in Western Australia .

00:01:04.932 --> 00:01:08.670
I will be talking to you about
captioning tips and tricks

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.080
to make captioning
easier and faster.

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:14.350
Why captioned video content?

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.290
Because providing Captions
and a transcript of audio

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:23.150
and visual material is required
to pass level A of the WCAG,

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.850
web content
accessibility guidelines.

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.250
It doesn't only benefit
people with disabilities.

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.520
Many people don't have sound on when
scrolling social media for example.

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.240
They might be in a really noisy
place like a bus or a train

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.020
and they prefer to read the
Captions while they watch the video.

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.370
They may not have their headphones
on and that helps people

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:47.630
who are learning English as a
second language which is well.

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:50.860
And if you are relying
on audio captions you

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.530
may not get the
message you intended.

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.621
These are some of
my favorite bloopers

00:01:55.622 --> 00:01:57.230
from auto English on YouTube.

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:02.460
Searching for lots of engine
people, should have been searching

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:03.930
for lost and injured people.

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:08.790
What laser head,
should have been what lays ahead

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:15.450
and BBC's Michael finds pleasure
in triple slow should be

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.440
if you see smoke or flames
please ring triple zero.

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.160
Here at the emergency
services, it's really important

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.850
that we get the message across.

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:27.360
It could be a matter of
saving people's lives.

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.810
But also to avoid embarrassment.

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.160
Can you imagine if you are CEO
or in our case our commissioner

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.470
was captioned in one
of these on the left

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.160
when he should have been
speaking something on the right.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.630
It will save a lot of
embarrassment if you

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:46.010
actually captioned it correctly.

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:50.760
So how do I caption?

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.430
Well, I use YouTube.

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.510
So you've uploaded
your video in YouTube.

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:04.210
Now you go to subtitles on the
left, the auto English Captions

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:06.130
have already been generated.

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:09.110
So, click duplicate
and edit then continue.

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:17.110
I like to edit times as I go
rather than edit a block of text.

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:21.220
So you click edit timings,
then you start editing.

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.670
Check the words are accurate
and aligned with the audio.

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:37.230
You can adjust the text box on
the timeline by dragging the ends,

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.610
making it longer or shorter.

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:43.590
You want to break in the
natural pauses of the audio.

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:48.730
Hi, my name is Ronnie.

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.560
I'm with Marine rescue and
I've been a volunteer here

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:06.660
for about four years.

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:12.370
If the text boxes are side by
side and you want to combine them,

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:14.040
you can press the backspace key.

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:20.880
To split them, put the marker in
the break in between audio segments

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:21.880
and press enter.

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:25.160
It's a real time saver
doing it that way.

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:39.380
You should make your two
lines of text even length.

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:42.340
Do this by pressing
shift and enter.

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:47.190
And I always delete spaces
on the ends of the lines.

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.570
Here, I'm editing a three minute
video so I'll speed this up.

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:57.440
You need to check spelling, capital
letters add punctuation et cetera.

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:00.667
It's slow and time-consuming,
but it's worth it.

00:05:00.667 --> 00:05:16.983
[VIDEO PLAYING]

00:05:16.983 --> 00:05:19.740
Here there is a change
of speaker in the video.

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:23.060
It's important you know that
with the symbol of some kind.

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:26.750
I use two greater than
arrows before they speak.

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:28.910
You can use something else
as long as you're consistent.

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:34.540
If the speaker reappears later, I
use the symbols again plus there name

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:35.540
in square brackets.

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:02.740
Even though these two lines
appear even on the video screen,

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:04.490
I split them anyway.

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:07.070
If someone watches
this on a wider screen,

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:09.650
it would display differently
if you don't split them.

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:13.390
Never go to three lines.

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:15.810
Try and find a spot to
cut it if it's too long.

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:28.410
Always spell in the
language of your audience.

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:33.580
For example,
meters in Australia is M-E-T-R-E-S.

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:35.830
So I’ll change it from the
American spelling here.

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:37.180
So, that's it.

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:39.310
I’ve made it to the
end of the video.

00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:42.040
Now, I go back to the
beginning and I watch it again

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:44.800
to make sure it's all good
and I haven't missed anything.

00:07:45.910 --> 00:07:48.010
At the same time today,
I'll skip this part.

00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:52.460
Right, so I’m back at the end.

00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:53.950
I'm happy with what I've done.

00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:55.710
So now you click publish.

00:08:01.310 --> 00:08:04.530
Then we can delete the
auto English Captions file

00:08:07.910 --> 00:08:11.180
and download our edited
Captions as an SRT file.

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:15.000
Choose a folder and click save.

00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:24.100
That's captioning complete.

00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:27.200
Now we can use that SRT
file to write a transcript.

00:08:32.210 --> 00:08:36.430
Open in Notepad,
select all and copy.

00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:43.350
Then I open this website that
converts the SRT file to text.

00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:49.000
Paste it in at the top,
click convert at the bottom.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.920
It strips out all the numbers
and formatting for you.

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:56.290
Then I like to change it to
the line measure feature here

00:08:56.290 --> 00:08:58.330
so it's all in one paragraph.

00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:11.550
Then we copy that output,
open up a Word document.

00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:18.710
I'm going to open an old transcript
and save it as a new one.

00:09:31.224 --> 00:09:42.534
Then I delete everything except the
heading and paste the transcript

00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:46.690
and I add a title.

00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:09.820
And then we add the details in like
the name of the person speaking,

00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:15.080
any text on the screen,
make paragraphs, et cetera.

00:10:17.831 --> 00:10:21.153
While listening to the
video, you might find

00:10:21.154 --> 00:10:22.400
that you've made a mistake.

00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:28.590
So, because we made a change
to this transcript, we have

00:10:28.590 --> 00:10:33.090
to reflect that change in
the subtitles on YouTube.

00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:37.890
So, you can just go edit
here and make that change.

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:48.590
You can also change it in the
SRT file that we downloaded.

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:05.290
Our video had text on the screen
at the beginning so don't forget

00:12:05.290 --> 00:12:08.390
to add any text that your
video might have on the screen.

00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:31.400
And there we have it.

00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:35.420
Come to the end, don't forget to
make your document accessible,

00:12:37.824 --> 00:12:39.626
add any headings

00:12:57.542 --> 00:12:59.160
and that's it, complete.

00:13:03.039 --> 00:13:14.199
Save it then as a PDF and
then we have an online portal

00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:17.580
where we can upload these
documents on our Internet

00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:20.670
but you can use SharePoint or
one drive or something similar.

00:13:33.090 --> 00:13:43.280
Then copy the link and I
create a [unintelligible]

00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:44.590
link for both files.

00:13:51.631 --> 00:13:52.296
Copy that

00:14:01.641 --> 00:14:05.996
and paste it into the
description box on YouTube.

00:14:24.810 --> 00:14:27.980
That way people watching the
video can download the transcript

00:14:27.980 --> 00:14:31.690
if they wish and you've
passed the AAA level

00:14:31.690 --> 00:14:35.290
of WCAG disability online
full video content.

00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:41.170
Altogether, this process
took me just over an hour

00:14:41.170 --> 00:14:43.340
which I think is pretty good
for a three minute video.

00:14:45.970 --> 00:14:49.890
Don't forget to save and
thanks so much for watching.

00:14:49.890 --> 00:14:55.050
I hope I've given you some knowledge
and you'll be able to do that

00:14:55.050 --> 00:14:56.460
on your videos from now on.
