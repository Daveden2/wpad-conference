00:00:00.038 --> 00:00:30.864
[silence]

00:00:30.865 --> 00:00:33.970
>> JAY MCKAY: Welcome to
WordPress Accessibility Day.

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:37.240
My name is Jay McKay and I'm the
director of Community Programs

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:38.770
at Knowbility.

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:45.310
Thank you for joining us for our
next session, Think smart and adapt:

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:49.760
meeting WCAG 2 without rebuilding
from scratch with Mike Ziemak

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.790
from Cut2Code.

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:53.670
Mike has been on quite a journey.

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.900
He's fond of new technologies,
computer games, and good music

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.340
after graduating from Conservatory,
he was working as a singer

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:02.820
and a music teacher.

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.730
Then spent a year working
as a creative director

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:09.540
for a boutique e-commerce photo
studio before falling in love

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:10.760
with WordPress.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.530
I'm really excited
for today's session.

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.170
Please feel free to add your
questions in the Q&A tab in Slido.

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:23.390
We will answer them at the end and
then use, use the Ideas section

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.160
to chat with other attendees.

00:01:32.256 --> 00:01:32.880
>> MIKE ZIEMAK: Hello everyone.

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.480
It's so great to have you.

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:37.600
My name is Mike and I'm a
project manager at Cut2Code.

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:40.550
Just let me quickly
introduce our company.

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:44.190
We are a web development agency
and we create WebPress sites

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:45.520
and Shopify stores.

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.180
We work with a broad range of
clients, starting from universities

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:53.120
and research companies from the US
chemistry noble prize laureates,

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:57.330
local communities, upcycling
brands, and NGOs fighting AIDS

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.370
and the world hunger.

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:02.970
The main aim of
this presentation is

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:06.640
to address some of the common
web accessibility issues

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.070
and to demonstrate the most
time and cost-efficient methods

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:12.820
of resolving them.

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:14.940
At some point of this
presentation, I would also like

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.180
to show you the difference
between the approach

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:18.550
we had even two years ago

00:02:18.551 --> 00:02:21.290
and our current website
accessibility practices.

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.200
I will also demonstrate some
solutions that have been a point

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.150
of reference and a source
of inspiration for our work.

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.830
We'll also go through a couple of
the most popular WebPress sites

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.660
to pinpoint good
and a bad practices.

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.840
It is understandable that
people may not want to go

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:43.450
through various documentations, which
they provide an invaluable source

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.480
of knowledge, might seem daunting
for an average website owner.

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.140
This is why rather than
focusing on theory,

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.320
my goal was to present the
content in a practical way,

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:56.220
focusing on real-life examples
and explaining the reasons

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.760
behind using certain solutions.

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.980
In the course of this presentation,
I will be emphasizing the fact

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.540
that web accessibility is not
a one-time action or something

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.440
that you can simply check or
tick with a particular solution

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.070
like a plugin, but rather a
mindset, a one that needs

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:17.010
to be adopted and constantly
taken into consideration.

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:20.570
It's an investment, though,
not necessarily a financial one

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:23.970
that basic dividends and equal
opportunities for a larger group

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:24.990
of people.

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:27.700
As a result, this will
translate into increased traffic

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:32.890
and these people may have a
chance to become your clients

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:34.240
or customers.

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:36.540
Not to mention the fact
that we can avoid lawsuits,

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.850
which used to be individual
cases in the past,

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:41.660
but are now becoming more and more
popular, especially in the US.

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.160
Another benefit of adopting
accessibility standards

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.300
on your website is that it
simplifies the user experience

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:52.380
and makes it easier and more
pleasant to navigate this site.

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:55.810
As an old-school keyboard person
myself, I'm particularly inclined

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:58.010
to websites and web
apps that allow me

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:00.680
to navigate entirely
using the keyboard.

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.420
There are other benefits of
following accessibility standards

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:06.844
such as higher ranking
in search engines,

00:04:06.845 --> 00:04:09.930
but I will not be covering this
in this presentation.

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:13.920
Okay,
so let me go to the takeaways.

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:18.440
What to know before choosing
an accessibility plugin?

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:24.280
Plugins, since most features
a WordPress site can offer are

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.010
usually achieved by the
use of certain commercial

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:28.370
or non-commercial plugins.

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:31.230
It's the very first thing that
comes into mind of a site owner

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:34.660
when thinking about implementing
accessibility solutions.

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:37.690
We'll feature some of the most
popular accessibility plugins

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:41.460
and discuss the core acceptance
criteria that they should meet.

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:44.610
You will learn what to pay attention
to in your choice of plugins

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:47.460
and how to differentiate
between good and bad ones.

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:51.710
What are differences
between bad practices

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:54.720
and accessibility-oriented
solutions?

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:56.568
Well, to give you a
hands-on experience,

00:04:56.569 --> 00:04:57.830
we'll go through an example

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:00.680
of a badly optimized page
and see what we can do

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:02.770
to fix the accessibility
issues there.

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:04.840
This is also the section
where I'm going to show you

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:08.690
a couple of good examples on some
of the most popular WebPress sites.

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:10.570
For legal reasons,
for obvious reasons,

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:13.400
I would be showing you the
bad examples on live sites,

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.980
but unfortunately, it doesn't
really take much to find them

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:16.980
on the internet.

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:19.880
Now, as to the tips and
tricks on how to check

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:23.070
your current website
compliance with WCAG 2,

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:27.080
a thing on general
accessibility checkers.

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:30.430
There are various tools, both
commercial and non-commercial ones

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:33.290
that allow us to check our
score and assess the scale

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:35.920
of accessibility issues
and thus can help us plan

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:37.940
and prioritize specific actions.

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:40.610
Virtually,
all of these checkers will indicate

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:44.590
which issues should be prioritized
as not all of the issues are

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:46.160
of equal severity.

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:51.010
I'm sure that you're familiar
with the three compliance levels.

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:55.550
We distinguish three compliance
levels within the WCAG 2.

00:05:55.550 --> 00:06:00.830
This is the A, AAA, and AAA,
and they are minimal, acceptable,

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:04.300
and optimal accessibility
thresholds respectively.

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:08.250
Unsurprisingly, you should act on
the most critical level A issues

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:10.760
before addressing AA or AAAA.

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:11.780
There's a caveat though.

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:15.850
One needs to acknowledge that
depending on the website content

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:19.920
or the layout of the design,
it may not always be possible

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:23.410
to achieve 90% and above score
in the highest AAA level.

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:29.630
Ways to improve accessibility
on the website or by yourself.

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:33.030
When adopting accessibility
best practices,

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:35.909
one needs to remember that
in installing a plugin

00:06:35.909 --> 00:06:38.665
or hiring an agency to
code some functionalities

00:06:38.665 --> 00:06:41.130
is not the ultimate solution.

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:43.820
There are some issues that
obviously cannot be resolved

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:45.450
without web development expertise

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:47.910
and it could even potentially
be dangerous if amended

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:49.610
by the site owners themselves.

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:53.480
There are certain steps that you
can and should take by yourself

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:56.140
to increase the
accessibility for all users.

00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:59.510
While you may not be able to globally
change font sizes from pixels

00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:04.210
to REM values or to properly
structure the HTML scaffolding,

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:07.090
you probably know the
content and the context

00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:09.990
of your website more
than any developer.

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:12.650
Your contribution should
not be underestimated.

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:14.350
At the latest stage
of this presentation,

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:17.150
you will see that web
agency can actually give you

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:20.760
accessibility-optimized website
foundations, but the rest is

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:21.780
in your hands.

00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:24.540
That's why it's so crucial
to remain ever-informed

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:26.720
about the best
practices and understand

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:32.560
what this accessibility
is all about.

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:36.150
Now, accessibility in real life,
we'll go through a case study.

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:38.940
In this part of the presentation,
we're going to showcase

00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:41.950
a real-life example of a website
which has been transformed

00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:44.020
with accessibility in mind.

00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:47.620
Another digital agency, our
business partner reached out to us

00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:49.936
as they needed to improve the
accessibility score measured

00:07:49.936 --> 00:07:52.600
by site improve
on the client's website.

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:56.780
The acceptable threshold was 85,
as that is the industry standard

00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:57.910
for education.

00:07:57.910 --> 00:08:01.010
At the time,
the score was around 60, so well,

00:08:01.010 --> 00:08:03.890
we roll out the sleeves,
did some research, and helped them

00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:07.080
with achieving a more
than satisfactory score.

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:09.380
Actually, the screenshots I
will be showing are showing

00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:12.030
a slightly lower score
than the current one

00:08:12.030 --> 00:08:14.730
as I was preparing the
presentation at four.

00:08:14.730 --> 00:08:16.880
I will run a check on
this site in real-time

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:18.660
to show you how much
it has improved.

00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:21.690
Just within a couple of days,
you'll see that it's possible

00:08:21.690 --> 00:08:23.937
to significantly improve
accessibility score

00:08:23.937 --> 00:08:27.580
and avoid lawsuits without resulting
to rebuilding website entirely.

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:35.980
The pros and cons of accessibility
plugins, what the check before,

00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:36.980
choosing one.

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:42.000
As to the pros and cons
of plugins in general,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.160
these are usually the same
regardless of the plugins purpose.

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:49.060
The good thing about them
is that they provide a quick

00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:52.560
and easy solution to one's
problems, but unfortunately,

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:56.210
they also come with the downsides,
like the reduced site performance

00:08:56.210 --> 00:08:57.990
and lack of flexibility.

00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:05.520
This is the list of plugins,
a couple of plugins that you can see

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:07.140
in the WordPress repository.

00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:09.970
The first thought that arises when
we want to improve accessibility

00:09:09.970 --> 00:09:12.580
without a lot of
expense are plugins,

00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:17.820
and there are quite a few of them.

00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:20.980
First of all, these are the
questions that we need to ask

00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:23.750
before you want to utilize a plugin

00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:26.450
to implement some
accessibility features.

00:09:26.450 --> 00:09:31.460
The toolbar, how does it look,
and is it a keyboard navigable?

00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:35.490
Let me draw your attention to the
toolbar as most of the plugins come

00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:36.390
with one.

00:09:36.390 --> 00:09:39.200
How does it look and is
it actually accessible?

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:41.760
What needs to test this
aspect of a plugin?

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:45.790
We need to make sure that the plugin
toolbars are properly visible,

00:09:45.790 --> 00:09:49.300
they have correct color contrast,
and that they can be easily navigable

00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:50.600
using the keyboard.

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:54.130
If your plugin doesn't meet
all of these requirements,

00:09:54.130 --> 00:09:59.050
it's better to find another one,
and there's just plenty of them.

00:09:59.050 --> 00:10:02.410
Another thing, what are its functions
when we are testing a plugin.

00:10:02.410 --> 00:10:05.570
Another question is,
what are the toolbar's functions,

00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:08.740
and are these features
working correctly?

00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:13.600
Believe me or not, I tested various
plugins prior to this presentation,

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:19.730
and I must say that using some
of them was a complete nightmare.

00:10:19.730 --> 00:10:22.370
Now think about customization.

00:10:22.370 --> 00:10:25.170
Is it possible to customize
the plugin features

00:10:25.170 --> 00:10:27.850
and can I extend its functionality?

00:10:29.110 --> 00:10:31.500
Regarding the customization,
some of the plugins come

00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:35.670
with extra options that you can
enable from the admin panel level.

00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:38.640
The plugin settings
might give you an ability

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:42.130
to increase the phone size
globally or change the styling

00:10:42.130 --> 00:10:45.010
of the toolbar itself,
which is particularly useful,

00:10:45.010 --> 00:10:47.920
if let's say the
plugin toolbar is dark

00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:54.400
and your website theme is using
dark colors as well or vice versa.

00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:58.400
Another thing that you can do
with customizable plugins is,

00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:01.160
for instance, you can adjust
the skip to content button.

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:06.630
Sometimes we have a situation
where the ID of the main section

00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:10.000
on a page might be slightly
different than usual.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:15.630
It's nice to have an option to
insert custom IDs so that the skip

00:11:15.630 --> 00:11:17.520
to content button can
link to it correctly.

00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:26.640
Okay, now we're going to-- How
we going to change the screen?

00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:27.640
Thank you.

00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:31.620
I'm using the sandbox
environment here.

00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:38.280
Let's go to the admin
panel and plugins.

00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:41.970
I'm going to show you just two
of these plugins, AccessibleWP -

00:11:41.970 --> 00:11:43.340
Accessibility Toolbar.

00:11:43.340 --> 00:11:45.570
This one, it's quite common.

00:11:45.570 --> 00:11:46.590
It's quite popular.

00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:49.210
Let's activate this plugin.

00:11:52.510 --> 00:11:56.450
As you can see, there is this sky,
AccessibleWP disappeared here.

00:11:56.450 --> 00:12:05.080
Let's go back to the homepage and
we can notice that there's a toolbar

00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:06.810
here in the upper left corner.

00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:13.710
I'm only using the keyboard
to navigate the site.

00:12:13.710 --> 00:12:15.660
Let me refresh.

00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:19.510
I'm only using the keyboard,
and actually, I'm clicking

00:12:19.510 --> 00:12:26.500
through the entire admin bar,
so I can log out, I can skip

00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:27.090
to content.

00:12:27.090 --> 00:12:30.620
This skip to content button is
actually a native functionality

00:12:30.620 --> 00:12:33.050
of this environment,
so it's not part of the plugin.

00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:40.110
Logo homepage, bad example, empty
item, I'm scrolling through the menu.

00:12:40.110 --> 00:12:44.140
I'm scrolling through the
links, some of the items.

00:12:49.970 --> 00:12:52.410
Basically, I have to scroll
through the entire site.

00:12:52.410 --> 00:12:54.841
I have to click through
the entire site to get

00:12:54.841 --> 00:12:56.890
to this plugin navigation.

00:12:58.470 --> 00:13:01.500
That's a huge or rather huge
disadvantage of this plugin

00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:08.950
but it has some nice features
like keyboard navigation.

00:13:08.950 --> 00:13:12.380
I'm not entirely sure
how effective it is.

00:13:12.380 --> 00:13:17.100
I'm not really confident
that it's very useful

00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:21.550
as sometimes implementing
keyboard navigation

00:13:21.551 --> 00:13:22.890
is not that straightforward.

00:13:24.450 --> 00:13:26.230
You can also disable animations.

00:13:27.310 --> 00:13:29.070
You can increase contrast.

00:13:29.070 --> 00:13:34.420
Actually, as you can see,
the navigation here is confusing

00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:37.620
because this should be
on and actually it's off.

00:13:38.770 --> 00:13:43.120
The visual indicator shows
that we are using a function

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:44.570
and actually we are not using it.

00:13:44.570 --> 00:13:47.330
This is confusing.

00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:48.400
Decrease text.

00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:52.830
Readable font, I think doesn't
have any effect on the site.

00:13:55.010 --> 00:13:59.980
Mark titles, highlight
things, and buttons.

00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:01.470
This is cool.

00:14:01.470 --> 00:14:09.450
In general, I would say that it's not
the best plugin that I've ever had

00:14:09.450 --> 00:14:13.150
and it's definitely not
something that I would recommend

00:14:13.150 --> 00:14:16.020
because of the fact that
it's not easily accessible.

00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:19.780
That's deactivate the plugin.

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:26.480
Pages, plugins, deactivate,
and let's try another one.

00:14:28.430 --> 00:14:30.390
Another plugin is One
Click Accessibility.

00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:35.030
Let's go to the homepage.

00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:40.970
There was a very subtle rectangle
here in the upper left corner.

00:14:44.370 --> 00:14:47.050
Let me just refresh the site.

00:14:47.050 --> 00:14:50.700
I press tab once and I have
the skip to content button,

00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:54.170
which is an actual
functionality of this plugin.

00:14:54.170 --> 00:14:57.760
It's not the original skip to
content button and the other tab.

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:01.970
One more tab further,
I'm in accessibility tool

00:15:01.970 --> 00:15:04.860
so I can reach the
toolbar quite easily.

00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:06.540
It's very useful.

00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:09.300
I can click through
or scroll through,

00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:13.930
click through these
functionalities, increase text.

00:15:16.290 --> 00:15:18.350
I can do it repeatedly.

00:15:19.370 --> 00:15:25.290
I can decrease text,
get back to the original one.

00:15:25.290 --> 00:15:29.420
Grayscale,
high contrast comes in handy.

00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:31.780
Negative contrast comes in handy.

00:15:31.780 --> 00:15:36.140
Light background, links on the
line, it's very important.

00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:38.120
As you can see,
it makes a huge difference.

00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:43.860
It's a very important aspect
of implementing accessibility

00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:44.900
on your website.

00:15:44.900 --> 00:15:49.340
Links, you should never rely
on the color differences

00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:52.280
between plain text and the links.

00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:54.810
They should always have
some additional indication

00:15:54.810 --> 00:15:57.580
that they are actually
links and not just text.

00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:04.140
Readable font, either full and
reset to reset all the features.

00:16:06.090 --> 00:16:08.170
I would say that it's
a really good plugin.

00:16:08.170 --> 00:16:10.450
It's a really nice solution.

00:16:10.450 --> 00:16:12.880
It's quite lightweight, very lean.

00:16:14.180 --> 00:16:18.980
Maybe if I were really,
really want to exigent,

00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:28.950
I would say that the toolbar
Icon is too subtle for my taste,

00:16:28.950 --> 00:16:34.550
but still, within the reach
of two clicks, you can get

00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:37.140
into the accessibility tools.

00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:37.810
That's really cool.

00:16:37.810 --> 00:16:39.930
That's a very useful plugin.

00:16:39.930 --> 00:16:43.930
If you're looking for an easy
way, a quick, and free way

00:16:43.930 --> 00:16:46.136
to improve your
website accessibility,

00:16:46.137 --> 00:16:48.108
you should definitely go
for this one.

00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:51.890
Okay.

00:16:51.890 --> 00:16:53.120
let me deactivate the plugin.

00:17:01.410 --> 00:17:02.410
Deactivate.

00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:09.270
All right.

00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:12.530
Let's get back to the slideshow.

00:17:17.418 --> 00:17:17.890
Thank you.

00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:25.250
A thing about good and bad
practices, dos and don'ts

00:17:25.250 --> 00:17:26.710
of accessibility development.

00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:31.060
In this section,
I'm going to show you a couple

00:17:31.060 --> 00:17:34.070
of truly evident
accessibility errors.

00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:38.000
I've created a sandbox site where
I will demonstrate bad practices

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.680
and show some tips and tricks on
how to fix them efficiently using

00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:43.540
just the Gutenberg editor.

00:17:43.540 --> 00:17:48.480
I can't say that I've had a vast
experience with heavyweight builders

00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:53.260
like Elementor and the
like, but I'm pretty sure

00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:56.140
that they should
provide similar options.

00:17:56.140 --> 00:17:59.040
I'm quite confident that
you'll have basic functions

00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:04.110
like alternative text
for images and so on.

00:18:07.530 --> 00:18:09.890
We need to go back to the site.

00:18:09.890 --> 00:18:15.790
Thank you.

00:18:19.050 --> 00:18:21.140
Let me open the bad example here.

00:18:26.950 --> 00:18:32.130
Well, let's take a look at
the hero image on this page.

00:18:32.130 --> 00:18:35.880
The text reads, "Have yourself a
little coffee, you deserve it."

00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:40.060
Beside the fact that it's cheesy
and that the color contrast

00:18:40.060 --> 00:18:42.160
here is simply outrageous.

00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:47.780
You may notice that nothing happens
when I'm trying to grab this text.

00:18:47.780 --> 00:18:51.204
I'm trying to select the
text with the mouse cursor,

00:18:51.205 --> 00:18:52.560
but nothing happens.

00:18:53.980 --> 00:18:58.620
This is because the dreaded image
of text and it's a huge no-no

00:18:58.620 --> 00:19:00.880
for any respectable content editor.

00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:03.150
It's definitely something
that we should avoid.

00:19:05.710 --> 00:19:10.160
If we scroll down further
a bit to the text section,

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:13.050
we'll notice that
there are no margins.

00:19:13.050 --> 00:19:17.840
The letters adhere directly to the
viewport and it's just a torture

00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:18.690
to read.

00:19:18.690 --> 00:19:20.870
It's important to add some margins.

00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:24.340
In WordPress, especially in
Gutenberg editor, you can do so

00:19:24.340 --> 00:19:26.800
by inserting the text
into a container.

00:19:28.530 --> 00:19:35.790
Sometimes it's not easily
noticeable, but I think in this case,

00:19:35.790 --> 00:19:38.950
it's rather evident that the headings
don't have a correct hierarchy.

00:19:38.950 --> 00:19:43.520
As you can see, the first one here
is a bit smaller, sample heading.

00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:45.680
This sample heading
is a bit larger.

00:19:47.455 --> 00:19:56.049
The correct hierarchy is H1 to H6,
without skipping any heading levels

00:19:56.050 --> 00:19:59.520
in between, doesn't necessarily
mean that you have to use all

00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:02.660
of the heading levels on
all of pages that you have.

00:20:03.910 --> 00:20:08.930
If we are using, let's say,
H2 and H4, let's make sure

00:20:08.930 --> 00:20:10.500
that there is an H3 in between.

00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:14.860
Another good practice
for the headings,

00:20:14.860 --> 00:20:19.210
is that there should be only one
H1 level heading for the page.

00:20:19.210 --> 00:20:26.880
It's also important from the
reader's mode standpoint,

00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:31.130
and it helps the screen readers
to render the sites properly.

00:20:33.610 --> 00:20:37.030
Let's scroll to this one.

00:20:37.030 --> 00:20:40.910
Well, another thing that should be
amended here, is the color contrast.

00:20:40.910 --> 00:20:45.980
While these examples are flagrantly
illegible, even for people

00:20:45.980 --> 00:20:50.380
with perfect vision, even if you're
a-- I don't know, a [inaudible],

00:20:50.380 --> 00:20:53.360
there are some color issues here.

00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:57.860
There are some color combinations,
which might look okay

00:20:57.860 --> 00:21:02.030
at the first glance,
but will be unreadable by people

00:21:02.030 --> 00:21:04.250
with various types
of color blindness.

00:21:04.250 --> 00:21:07.570
This is why a color contrast
checker is an absolute must

00:21:07.570 --> 00:21:10.270
before we add any
content to our website.

00:21:11.850 --> 00:21:13.760
Now, for the upper case text, well,

00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:18.850
not only that it's particularly
annoying in my opinion at least,

00:21:18.850 --> 00:21:21.600
but it's also difficult to read.

00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:26.850
I think we should definitely reduce
it to an absolute bare minimum.

00:21:26.850 --> 00:21:29.310
If we really have to
use the uppercase text,

00:21:29.310 --> 00:21:33.560
let's make sure that we use it
for emphasizing certain words,

00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:39.100
not for emphasizing an entire
paragraph just like we have it here.

00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:44.720
Another thing, if your copy
contains URLs, like we have here,

00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:53.470
https://google.com, well, I can't
really do anything with the zero,

00:21:53.470 --> 00:21:55.700
as it's not a correct link.

00:21:55.700 --> 00:21:58.630
Make sure,
if your copy contains URLs,

00:21:58.630 --> 00:22:01.470
you need to make sure that
they're not plain text,

00:22:01.470 --> 00:22:06.020
they need the actual links so
that they can be easily accessed.

00:22:06.020 --> 00:22:11.420
The same thing goes for email
addresses and the telephone numbers.

00:22:13.380 --> 00:22:20.620
The email addresses, we need to make
sure that they are using the mailto:

00:22:21.710 --> 00:22:25.410
prefix in the href value.

00:22:25.410 --> 00:22:28.440
For the phone numbers,
these should be using a tel:

00:22:29.550 --> 00:22:33.150
prefix in the href value as well.

00:22:33.150 --> 00:22:36.090
Usually, the Gutenberg
editor can help us with this,

00:22:36.090 --> 00:22:40.590
as it should turn URLs and email
addresses into actual links

00:22:40.590 --> 00:22:41.810
without any prompt.

00:22:41.810 --> 00:22:43.820
It just does it automatically.

00:22:44.930 --> 00:22:49.120
The phone numbers though, they're
not rendered by default as links,

00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:51.870
because also they have
slightly different formatting,

00:22:51.870 --> 00:22:55.560
because of the country
codes and so on and so on.

00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:59.300
They are usually not rendered as
links, and they might need more,

00:22:59.300 --> 00:23:02.580
let's say,
manual input from the editors.

00:23:05.310 --> 00:23:13.650
Even if we amend the link
here, okay, let's get busy.

00:23:13.650 --> 00:23:15.920
Let's try to fix this page.

00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:21.820
I'm going to Edit Page and
change some of these things.

00:23:23.540 --> 00:23:30.070
First of all, I would get rid
of this image and replace it

00:23:30.070 --> 00:23:34.500
with an actual image
without any text.

00:23:38.690 --> 00:23:39.670
All right.

00:23:39.670 --> 00:23:41.610
We have alternative text.

00:23:41.610 --> 00:23:44.760
We can insert some
old text here like

00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:47.259
"a coffee maker and
a cup of coffee".

00:23:53.180 --> 00:23:53.830
What else?

00:23:53.830 --> 00:23:57.090
We can add text over the image.

00:23:57.090 --> 00:24:01.100
This is what Gutenberg
editor allows us to do.

00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:02.270
Add text over the image.

00:24:09.780 --> 00:24:13.210
I want to make it a heading.

00:24:20.170 --> 00:24:23.840
Let's make it Heading 1.

00:24:26.770 --> 00:24:29.060
"Have yourself a little coffee."

00:24:29.060 --> 00:24:31.990
I think we could get
rid of the overlay.

00:24:31.990 --> 00:24:33.170
We don't need it.

00:24:33.170 --> 00:24:37.870
Sometimes it's useful, especially
if we have tons of various colors

00:24:37.870 --> 00:24:40.050
in the image itself,
and we want to make sure

00:24:41.890 --> 00:24:50.000
that the text is readable, then
we can apply some capacity filter

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:50.790
on that.

00:24:50.790 --> 00:24:53.300
In this case, I don't think
I'm going to use it that much.

00:24:58.420 --> 00:25:05.330
I'll just make sure that
dimensions are right.

00:25:05.330 --> 00:25:11.340
The dimensions are
right and looks good.

00:25:11.340 --> 00:25:14.930
It's not perfect, but it's definitely
readable, and its actual text,

00:25:14.930 --> 00:25:16.170
so that's cool.

00:25:21.070 --> 00:25:22.490
Online text left.

00:25:22.490 --> 00:25:27.570
Another thing that I would like to
amend here would be the containers

00:25:27.570 --> 00:25:29.730
or rather the lack of containers.

00:25:29.730 --> 00:25:31.840
It's easy to do it.

00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:37.820
I always use this list view,
so it helps me with determining

00:25:37.820 --> 00:25:40.700
which parent and child
element I'm using.

00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:50.970
Let's add a container here,
insert before container.

00:25:58.510 --> 00:26:05.260
We can just Control-Command.

00:26:05.260 --> 00:26:11.540
If you're using Mac,
Command-Shift, the entire text.

00:26:11.540 --> 00:26:13.472
All of these blocks,
they are selected,

00:26:13.472 --> 00:26:16.730
and we can just do Command-X

00:26:16.730 --> 00:26:23.890
to cut them, and now we can
insert them into the container.

00:26:29.340 --> 00:26:32.890
As you can see, we have the container
here, and inside this container,

00:26:32.890 --> 00:26:37.000
we have the heading,
paragraph, and so on.

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:39.150
Everything that we need.

00:26:43.330 --> 00:26:45.150
This should be helpful.

00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:52.470
Just let me check if we have-- Let's
see if we have the margin sign.

00:26:53.950 --> 00:26:56.190
It's good to check what it
looks like on the front end.

00:27:00.020 --> 00:27:05.060
We are missing the heading here but
it's not relevant at the moment,

00:27:05.060 --> 00:27:08.860
but we are definitely,
we've made some improvement,

00:27:08.860 --> 00:27:15.220
as we can see that we have the
margins now, so it's easy to read,

00:27:15.220 --> 00:27:19.400
but of course, what is not easy to
read here is the color contrast.

00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:21.650
Let's make sure that we are
using the right color contrast.

00:27:26.890 --> 00:27:27.890
Let's make it black.

00:27:32.580 --> 00:27:34.250
Let's make this a H2.

00:27:38.949 --> 00:27:40.859
Let's make it black as well.

00:27:45.630 --> 00:27:46.410
What is it?

00:27:46.410 --> 00:27:48.370
It's an H2 as well.

00:27:48.370 --> 00:27:49.680
Let's make it H3.

00:27:51.300 --> 00:27:53.170
It's not black.

00:27:53.170 --> 00:27:57.950
Let's get back here,
and make sure that it's black.

00:27:57.950 --> 00:28:04.320
It should be black now.

00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:07.080
H6, H3 here, H6 here.

00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:09.510
Well, that's a huge leap.

00:28:09.510 --> 00:28:10.850
Let's make it an H4.

00:28:13.300 --> 00:28:20.490
Let's change the text color here, and
let's make sure it's not upper case.

00:28:22.210 --> 00:28:23.210
Switch the default.

00:28:25.190 --> 00:28:27.880
Now it's a regular
text, normal text.

00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:28.640
Let's make sure

00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:33.870
that this https://google.com,
is an actual link.

00:28:33.870 --> 00:28:40.840
I'm just going to click link,
and automatically it becomes a link

00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:44.650
without manually inserting the URL.

00:28:44.650 --> 00:28:45.970
It's quite intelligent.

00:28:47.630 --> 00:28:53.990
Let's do the same for
the email address.

00:28:55.590 --> 00:28:59.090
As you can see, Gutenberg
editor automatically added mail

00:28:59.090 --> 00:29:00.560
to support@mailbox.com.

00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:06.140
I don't think it's going to be
that easy with the phone number,

00:29:06.140 --> 00:29:10.230
but let's give it a try.

00:29:11.780 --> 00:29:12.780
It's not that easy.

00:29:13.700 --> 00:29:26.630
Let me just copy with Command-C
and link tel, this is going

00:29:26.630 --> 00:29:30.770
to be an actual telephone link.

00:29:30.770 --> 00:29:32.570
Sample heading, well, H3.

00:29:32.570 --> 00:29:35.120
We don't want a H3 here.

00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:41.330
Let's make it an H4,
for instance, heading H6,

00:29:41.330 --> 00:29:43.890
I think we are lacking
H5, so let's make it H5.

00:29:51.902 --> 00:29:53.847
Same thing about the email here.

00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:09.140
All right, now it looks much better
where we still have this guy here,

00:30:11.730 --> 00:30:16.920
let's just make sure that we're
using an actual image and text

00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:19.570
instead of an image of text.

00:30:19.570 --> 00:30:21.880
I'm going to change this image.

00:30:48.790 --> 00:30:54.900
If we really didn't need it, we don't
have to put the text on the image.

00:30:58.940 --> 00:31:00.170
Should look much better now.

00:31:15.720 --> 00:31:20.080
This was how we were able to--
Sorry, sample heading,

00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:23.680
it get out of the container,
let me quickly fix it.

00:31:33.460 --> 00:31:35.793
Let's put it into the container.

00:31:42.410 --> 00:31:44.187
Let's make it H2.

00:31:58.540 --> 00:32:03.870
In just a couple of steps, we were
able to improve the accessibility

00:32:03.870 --> 00:32:04.870
of the site.

00:32:06.710 --> 00:32:07.930
This is what it looks like now.

00:32:09.060 --> 00:32:13.580
Let me get back to the slideshow.

00:32:17.130 --> 00:32:20.060
Let's discuss a couple
of action items.

00:32:20.060 --> 00:32:21.760
What can I do to fix it?

00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:24.490
What can I do to fix the
accessibility issues?

00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:32.900
First of all, you can add alternative
text to images is really important.

00:32:33.940 --> 00:32:35.740
When are we adding
alternative texts,

00:32:35.740 --> 00:32:42.110
it's important not to duplicate
the actual text, the actual copy.

00:32:42.110 --> 00:32:49.520
Let's say that we have John Doe,
and we have a picture of John Doe.

00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:55.250
Let's make sure not to use
John Doe as the alt text

00:32:55.250 --> 00:32:59.330
because the actual text will also
say John Doe so we have John Doe,

00:32:59.330 --> 00:33:05.020
John Doe, read by the screen readers,
and that's kind of confusing.

00:33:07.460 --> 00:33:11.128
We should make sure that we
are descriptions and subtitles

00:33:11.128 --> 00:33:12.424
to each video.

00:33:13.540 --> 00:33:18.700
Actually, you can do so with
help of most of the video tools

00:33:18.700 --> 00:33:22.410
like YouTube, Vimeo, and so on.

00:33:22.410 --> 00:33:31.042
They offer all the services
offer over this functionality.

00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:33.680
Make sure that the only
files are subtitled.

00:33:34.900 --> 00:33:37.120
This one is pretty
self-explanatory.

00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:41.690
It's pretty much the same as with
the videos, and check the structure

00:33:41.690 --> 00:33:42.440
of the headings.

00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:47.860
This is what we just done,
we've made sure that we have coming

00:33:47.860 --> 00:33:51.720
from H1 to H6 or to H4
but we're not skipping

00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:52.970
any of the heading levels.

00:33:58.780 --> 00:34:00.590
What else can you do by yourself?

00:34:00.590 --> 00:34:02.350
Choose a font size
that is easy to read.

00:34:04.390 --> 00:34:09.120
We want to make sure that the font
size that we have is easy to read.

00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:12.050
Refrain from inserting
images as links.

00:34:14.120 --> 00:34:19.970
It can also be confusing for people
who are using screen readers,

00:34:19.970 --> 00:34:24.000
and make sure you're not using
an illegible font family,

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:26.850
that's a rather important one.

00:34:26.850 --> 00:34:29.880
If you go to any of the site
checkers like Siteimprove,

00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:38.100
you can check what font
families are recommended

00:34:38.100 --> 00:34:42.600
and what font families are
not recommended and take care

00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:44.560
of the color contrast.

00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:47.877
As I said previously,
the color contrast checkers

00:34:47.877 --> 00:34:51.022
are an absolute must
whenever we insert,

00:34:51.022 --> 00:34:53.792
whenever we add new
content to our website.

00:34:57.230 --> 00:34:57.834
All right.

00:35:02.520 --> 00:35:05.790
The thing on the
accessibility checkers.

00:35:07.530 --> 00:35:11.090
Before we jump into this
subject, just a short caveat,

00:35:11.090 --> 00:35:13.540
from my experience,
if your goal is to make sure

00:35:13.540 --> 00:35:18.840
that your website is only
compliant with the standards

00:35:18.840 --> 00:35:22.460
to avoid lawsuits, you'll probably
be fine with using just one

00:35:22.460 --> 00:35:23.220
of them.

00:35:23.220 --> 00:35:25.030
Having said that,
if you really want

00:35:25.030 --> 00:35:29.670
to improve the website
accessibility, it makes more sense

00:35:29.670 --> 00:35:33.020
to compare the results of
at least two of these tools,

00:35:33.020 --> 00:35:34.110
as they will be slightly different.

00:35:35.150 --> 00:35:37.730
One tool might pinpoint
a specific error

00:35:37.730 --> 00:35:40.920
and another one might
just completely ignore.

00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:46.310
The first one that comes into
mind, I have the list here,

00:35:46.310 --> 00:35:50.510
so we have a list of a couple
of accessibility checkers,

00:35:50.510 --> 00:35:54.570
we have Siteimprove, IBM Equal Access
Toolkit, Wave, and QualityLogic.

00:35:58.410 --> 00:36:02.210
Siteimprove, it's an excellent tool,
which provides very default insights.

00:36:02.210 --> 00:36:03.940
I've used it on my
couple of occasions,

00:36:03.940 --> 00:36:06.010
and I can't recommend
it highly enough.

00:36:06.010 --> 00:36:08.210
One needs to keep in mind
that it's a commercial service

00:36:08.210 --> 00:36:10.180
so if you've got to have your
website checked for free,

00:36:10.180 --> 00:36:12.640
there are some
alternatives to that.

00:36:12.640 --> 00:36:16.810
Lighthouse accessibility
checker comes in a bundle

00:36:16.810 --> 00:36:18.710
with Google PageSpeed Insights.

00:36:18.710 --> 00:36:22.890
It will show you the most critical
errors, as overall quite lenient

00:36:22.890 --> 00:36:25.560
that compared to other
accessibility checkers.

00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:27.910
I personally never use it
as a point of reference

00:36:27.910 --> 00:36:29.920
for improving website
accessibility.

00:36:29.920 --> 00:36:33.500
It's nice to know that
you can also use it.

00:36:33.500 --> 00:36:36.790
Another one on the list is
coming from WebAccessibility.com,

00:36:36.790 --> 00:36:38.870
and its main functionality
is just basic score check

00:36:40.210 --> 00:36:44.050
but they provide some
commercial browser extensions.

00:36:44.050 --> 00:36:47.400
Interestingly,
they have tools that can help you

00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:50.790
with software development
lifecycle, so you can integrate them

00:36:50.790 --> 00:36:54.500
into your workflow, if you're
using tools for testing automation,

00:36:54.500 --> 00:36:57.980
like Selenium or Cypress,
this is something definitely worth

00:36:57.980 --> 00:36:59.530
developers' attention.

00:36:59.530 --> 00:37:01.160
Another thing that comes
into mind in regard

00:37:01.160 --> 00:37:04.830
to the free alternatives,
is the accessibilitychecker.org,

00:37:04.830 --> 00:37:07.530
which provides a rather detailed
report on the exact elements.

00:37:09.860 --> 00:37:13.060
The cool thing is that
you can actually choose

00:37:13.060 --> 00:37:15.650
which standards you'd like to
follow depending on your location.

00:37:15.650 --> 00:37:18.130
This is particularly
useful if your goal is

00:37:18.130 --> 00:37:21.090
to make sure that your website
is observing legal regulations

00:37:21.090 --> 00:37:22.090
in a specific country.

00:37:23.260 --> 00:37:25.780
My personal favorite
is WAVE by WebAIM.

00:37:25.780 --> 00:37:28.950
I'm not even sure if there's a
commercial option of this tool,

00:37:28.950 --> 00:37:31.530
because the free version
provides so much insight,

00:37:31.530 --> 00:37:33.150
I've never really
given it a thought.

00:37:33.150 --> 00:37:36.290
You can generate a detailed live
report which allows you to interact

00:37:36.290 --> 00:37:39.970
with it in real-time,
you can switch to other pages,

00:37:39.970 --> 00:37:43.200
it pinpoints all errors, warnings,
ARIA attributes, and so on,

00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:45.220
and so on.

00:37:45.220 --> 00:37:48.410
I'm just being conscious of
time, we're running out of time,

00:37:48.410 --> 00:37:53.250
but so I'm not going to go through
all of these accessibility checkers.

00:37:57.430 --> 00:38:00.270
Let's just quickly discuss
the benefits of things.

00:38:00.270 --> 00:38:03.860
They clearly show you what needs
to be fixed, at least some,

00:38:03.860 --> 00:38:07.470
if not most of them, they show
you what needs to be fixed,

00:38:07.470 --> 00:38:08.920
they usually show
you their priority.

00:38:16.210 --> 00:38:19.330
They also provide
suggestions on how to fix it.

00:38:21.120 --> 00:38:25.160
whenever you have an issue,
you can expand the issue,

00:38:25.160 --> 00:38:30.620
they have some dropdowns and
they can point you directly

00:38:30.620 --> 00:38:36.720
to the W3 reference where
you can see the documentation

00:38:38.410 --> 00:38:42.110
and you can check what
exactly needs to be fixed.

00:38:42.110 --> 00:38:47.710
They also help you with understanding
why certain things are considered

00:38:47.710 --> 00:38:48.780
as errors.

00:38:48.780 --> 00:38:53.530
It's also nice to have in
terms of educating yourself

00:38:53.530 --> 00:38:55.350
and staying other informed.

00:38:56.940 --> 00:38:59.000
Well, that goes without
saying they're compatible

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:00.930
with the latest WCAG requirements.

00:39:04.750 --> 00:39:07.040
Sometimes using
accessibility checkers,

00:39:08.650 --> 00:39:12.040
like running a full website
check would be an overkill.

00:39:12.040 --> 00:39:16.100
If we want to check certain color
combinations, we can just opt

00:39:16.100 --> 00:39:23.620
for a contrast checker like
the WebAIM contrast checker

00:39:23.620 --> 00:39:25.060
or Siteimprove contrast checker.

00:39:25.060 --> 00:39:28.620
I think we have the
site of group one here.

00:39:28.620 --> 00:39:37.310
As you can see, the ratio is
below 3:1, all of us will be held.

00:39:37.310 --> 00:39:44.020
We have the ratio here, 2.13:1,
and we're just failing all

00:39:46.220 --> 00:39:49.820
of the standards, we're not
meeting any of the standards.

00:39:51.340 --> 00:39:59.290
In this case, the ratio is 5.63 to
1, and actually, as you can see,

00:39:59.290 --> 00:40:05.000
we are almost, we're meeting
almost all of the standards.

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:08.940
We have AA for normal text.

00:40:08.940 --> 00:40:11.740
We are not meeting the
AAA for normal text.

00:40:11.740 --> 00:40:17.460
We're meeting AA for large text, AAA
for large text, and AA for graphics.

00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:21.030
All right.

00:40:21.820 --> 00:40:23.330
I'm just being conscious of time.

00:40:23.330 --> 00:40:26.230
Let me proceed to the case study.

00:40:27.670 --> 00:40:31.370
One of the universities in the
US reached out to our clients,

00:40:31.370 --> 00:40:33.280
our agency clients
as they needed help

00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:37.460
with making their website
compliant with WCAG 2.

00:40:37.460 --> 00:40:42.070
They emphasized that the score
needed to be 85 points or above

00:40:42.070 --> 00:40:44.880
to make sure that the
website was fully accessible

00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:48.540
and to avoid legal actions
be taken against them.

00:40:48.540 --> 00:40:51.250
This is a chart,
let me show you the chart.

00:40:52.440 --> 00:40:59.300
This is a chart of the score history,
the score and the issue history.

00:40:59.300 --> 00:41:03.140
When we started our work,
the overall score was 66,

00:41:03.140 --> 00:41:06.240
and there were several critical
A-level issues on the site,

00:41:06.240 --> 00:41:09.840
which as you can imagine, made it
virtually impossible to be read

00:41:09.840 --> 00:41:11.170
with assistive technologies.

00:41:13.260 --> 00:41:17.760
I'm just going to quickly list
some of the issues that we had.

00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:20.760
Some of the pages didn't have any
titles or they were extremely long.

00:41:22.130 --> 00:41:27.630
Actually, the page titles
are quite easily resolved

00:41:27.630 --> 00:41:34.050
with workers basically to
set the main website title.

00:41:34.050 --> 00:41:40.380
You just go to the general settings
and you have the respective fuel

00:41:41.640 --> 00:41:42.070
for that.

00:41:42.070 --> 00:41:46.130
The same thing with
individual pages.

00:41:46.130 --> 00:41:51.010
The very first heading of a page,
at least in Gutenberg editor.

00:41:51.010 --> 00:41:55.270
The very first heading of a
page is an actual HTML title.

00:41:57.310 --> 00:42:01.910
Also, there are no aria
labels to use and well,

00:42:01.910 --> 00:42:07.270
that makes it very difficult
if not impossible at all

00:42:07.270 --> 00:42:11.845
to navigate website of
using assistive technologies

00:42:11.846 --> 00:42:13.370
and many images.

00:42:13.370 --> 00:42:19.240
Were lacking old text,
so that's also a big no-no.

00:42:19.240 --> 00:42:21.180
The power contrast
needed to be improved.

00:42:21.180 --> 00:42:26.490
There was some places where
we had very low contrast

00:42:26.490 --> 00:42:28.210
and it was just difficult.

00:42:28.210 --> 00:42:29.780
It was fairly readable.

00:42:30.950 --> 00:42:34.400
When we finished working on the
site, the score was 87

00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:39.010
and then came the new content,
which introduced some minor issues,

00:42:39.010 --> 00:42:40.940
and reduced the score to 84.

00:42:40.940 --> 00:42:45.310
This was a very valuable lesson
for us as it proved it's crucial

00:42:45.310 --> 00:42:48.100
to stay ever-informed
about best practices.

00:42:48.100 --> 00:42:51.790
Our reaction was, first of
all, to make some revisions and

00:42:51.790 --> 00:42:54.390
to fix the issues,
and then to educate the client on

00:42:54.390 --> 00:42:56.320
how to keep the score high.

00:42:56.320 --> 00:42:59.000
At the moment, the site improved
score is slightly above 90,

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:04.350
and the A and AA level issues have
been reduced to the bare minimum

00:43:04.350 --> 00:43:07.640
because of the design layout
and also some complex features,

00:43:07.640 --> 00:43:12.580
it wasn't possible to
squeeze the maximum of it

00:43:12.580 --> 00:43:16.470
and to entirely get rid
of AAA level issues.

00:43:16.470 --> 00:43:20.380
This story clearly shows that
with the right tools and attitude,

00:43:20.380 --> 00:43:23.990
you can transform an average
site into a perfectly accessible

00:43:23.990 --> 00:43:25.310
and optimized website.

00:43:29.207 --> 00:43:30.090
>> JAY: All right.

00:43:30.090 --> 00:43:31.530
Thank you, Mike.

00:43:31.530 --> 00:43:32.210
This has been great.

00:43:32.210 --> 00:43:35.180
We have a couple of questions.

00:43:35.180 --> 00:43:37.170
This one came in twice.

00:43:37.170 --> 00:43:41.710
Does the grouping in containers
have an effect on an accessibility

00:43:41.710 --> 00:43:44.010
or the behavior of screen readers?

00:43:45.990 --> 00:43:51.920
>> MIKE: Well, I think it's important
to keep the right structure.

00:43:53.100 --> 00:43:56.450
Let's say the-- so how
do you mean grouping?

00:43:58.269 --> 00:44:03.490
>> JAY: I think when you were
looking at the, let me see

00:44:03.490 --> 00:44:05.140
if there was any
additional information.

00:44:07.240 --> 00:44:09.480
Oh, that's all I have,
just repeated twice.

00:44:10.648 --> 00:44:11.420
>> MIKE: All right.

00:44:11.420 --> 00:44:14.960
If the person asking the
question could elaborate on this,

00:44:14.960 --> 00:44:18.860
I'll be more than happy
to answer this question.

00:44:18.860 --> 00:44:29.970
Generally saying, well, the more
complex the container structure is,

00:44:29.970 --> 00:44:35.710
the more difficult it is for the
editors to keep it accessible, right?

00:44:35.710 --> 00:44:39.690
We should definitely,
I think simplicity is the key here.

00:44:39.690 --> 00:44:42.940
If we can do something in
an easy way, in a simple,

00:44:42.940 --> 00:44:44.870
straightforward way,
let's just opt for it.

00:44:47.590 --> 00:44:50.780
>> JAY: Then another
question about plugins.

00:44:50.780 --> 00:44:53.480
Are some plugins better for scale?

00:44:53.480 --> 00:44:58.560
Do some work better for smaller
sites and one or two operators,

00:44:58.560 --> 00:45:02.910
or maybe some work better for large
sites with multiple operators?

00:45:04.744 --> 00:45:05.327
>> MIKE: Sorry.

00:45:06.180 --> 00:45:07.490
How do you mean operators?

00:45:13.111 --> 00:45:16.390
>> JAY: Again,
I'm just reading as it's provided.

00:45:16.390 --> 00:45:17.390
>> MIKE: Oh.

00:45:18.600 --> 00:45:24.340
Yes, I think, well, with the
plugins, I think if they are simple

00:45:24.340 --> 00:45:32.100
and they are accessible,
then there is really no reason to.

00:45:33.898 --> 00:45:34.497
>> JAY: Oh.

00:45:34.498 --> 00:45:36.050
Just to clarify [crosstalk]

00:45:36.050 --> 00:45:37.490
>> MIKE: Operators as users.

00:45:37.490 --> 00:45:38.000
>> JAY: There we go.

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:38.900
>> MIKE: Operators as users.

00:45:38.900 --> 00:45:40.060
Okay, that makes sense.

00:45:40.060 --> 00:45:41.205
All right.

00:45:43.500 --> 00:45:48.850
I think also from the site
performance perspective,

00:45:48.850 --> 00:45:52.330
it's better to keep the plugins
as simple as possible, right?

00:45:54.710 --> 00:45:59.060
If using, let's say a heavyweight
plugin, which might be useful

00:45:59.060 --> 00:46:03.140
for implementing some of the
features on your website,

00:46:03.140 --> 00:46:07.850
if it's a complex one, you need
to take into account the fact

00:46:07.850 --> 00:46:10.350
that it's going to affect
the site performance.

00:46:11.940 --> 00:46:14.410
It's also something that
we need to keep in mind.

00:46:16.073 --> 00:46:16.610
>> JAY: Right.

00:46:16.610 --> 00:46:20.840
Then we have a couple questions
about the accessibility checkers.

00:46:20.840 --> 00:46:24.790
The first one is just, "Are there
some checkers that are better

00:46:24.790 --> 00:46:26.984
for bigger websites
versus smaller?"

00:46:33.090 --> 00:46:35.190
>> MIKE: Yes,
that's a good question.

00:46:35.190 --> 00:46:43.800
I would say that there are, basically
if you are using the free checkers,

00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:48.680
you are just running a check
against a single URL usually, right?

00:46:51.240 --> 00:46:56.180
It just takes more, let's
say, manual input to use,

00:46:56.180 --> 00:46:59.720
to enter all the euros and
make sure that all the pages

00:46:59.720 --> 00:47:03.820
that you're interested in that all
the pages are accessible, right?

00:47:03.820 --> 00:47:07.840
Whereas if you use
commercial services,

00:47:07.840 --> 00:47:11.150
which most of these
plugins really offer,

00:47:11.150 --> 00:47:16.380
if you use commercial services, well,
you basically have better support.

00:47:16.380 --> 00:47:21.060
You have a full site audit,
so you actually have people

00:47:21.060 --> 00:47:25.190
who are running the check for you.

00:47:25.190 --> 00:47:29.130
It's a matter of compromise
between doing a lot of manual work

00:47:29.130 --> 00:47:33.990
versus paying some money
for the check, right?

00:47:35.880 --> 00:47:38.944
>> JAY: Then there was
a comment referring

00:47:38.945 --> 00:47:42.600
to the accessibility checkers
that you mentioned.

00:47:42.600 --> 00:47:45.300
They're saying,
"Given that only about 30%

00:47:45.300 --> 00:47:48.880
of accessibility issues
are testable by automation,

00:47:48.880 --> 00:47:52.560
how do you claim that a test
with the checker can allow you

00:47:52.560 --> 00:47:55.820
to reach that WCAG compliance?"

00:47:55.820 --> 00:47:58.075
>> MIKE: I totally agree with that.

00:47:59.190 --> 00:48:01.350
That's absolutely true.

00:48:01.350 --> 00:48:06.920
Well, we need to realize that
there are certain limitations

00:48:06.920 --> 00:48:08.350
to these checkers, right?

00:48:08.350 --> 00:48:13.720
They are not as much as the
developers of these checkers may try.

00:48:13.720 --> 00:48:15.230
They're not intelligent at all.

00:48:17.490 --> 00:48:26.840
We should always rely on someone who
has more, someone who has expertise.

00:48:26.840 --> 00:48:31.480
We should refer to
the documentation.

00:48:31.480 --> 00:48:34.410
There are tons of educational
materials that you can read

00:48:34.410 --> 00:48:39.050
on the internet, and I think that
they provide much more insight

00:48:41.140 --> 00:48:45.450
than just running a check on
the website and then you think

00:48:45.450 --> 00:48:46.550
that you are done.

00:48:46.550 --> 00:48:47.690
That's completely not true.

00:48:49.830 --> 00:48:55.610
I think that's the most
important factor here.

00:48:55.610 --> 00:48:58.080
The human contribution, right?

00:48:58.080 --> 00:49:00.830
It's absolutely essential.

00:49:01.930 --> 00:49:05.790
I personally know a lot of sites,
I've been doing a lot of research

00:49:05.790 --> 00:49:09.440
on some of the most popular
sites, and I know a lot of sites

00:49:09.440 --> 00:49:15.410
which have tremendous scores,
which have really great scores,

00:49:15.410 --> 00:49:19.470
like above 90 on most of
the accessibility checkers,

00:49:19.470 --> 00:49:25.380
but they have basic,
really, really basic issues

00:49:25.380 --> 00:49:28.040
with keyboard navigation.

00:49:28.040 --> 00:49:32.560
We shouldn't only rely on
the checkers themselves,

00:49:32.560 --> 00:49:35.670
and we shouldn't treat them
as an absolute source of truth

00:49:35.670 --> 00:49:38.600
and a point of reference.

00:49:38.600 --> 00:49:42.170
It's a nice addition
and it's useful.

00:49:42.170 --> 00:49:46.760
I would say it's useful primarily
if your goal is to avoid lawsuits,

00:49:46.760 --> 00:49:51.640
just to get a certificate,
to show, to demonstrate

00:49:51.640 --> 00:49:53.530
that your website is
compliant, right?

00:49:53.530 --> 00:49:56.880
There is a huge difference between
compliance and accessibility itself.

00:49:56.880 --> 00:49:59.820
I also know sites which
are super accessible,

00:49:59.820 --> 00:50:03.400
which have tons of functionalities,
all the aria labels,

00:50:03.400 --> 00:50:06.740
descriptions keyboard
navigation, and so on and so on.

00:50:06.740 --> 00:50:11.220
At the same time, they have
a score of 70 which is okay

00:50:11.220 --> 00:50:14.310
but nothing's spectacular.

00:50:15.710 --> 00:50:18.330
I think it's super important.

00:50:18.330 --> 00:50:19.100
>> JAY: Right.

00:50:19.100 --> 00:50:23.050
Well, we are out of time but if
you have an answer to this question

00:50:23.050 --> 00:50:27.360
in 20 seconds,
do you recommend a particular plugin

00:50:27.360 --> 00:50:28.610
for eCommerce sites?

00:50:30.090 --> 00:50:31.690
>> MIKE: It would depends.

00:50:31.690 --> 00:50:35.490
If you mean WooCommerce,
then I would say that the plugin

00:50:35.490 --> 00:50:37.180
that I was showcasing
would be okay.

00:50:38.900 --> 00:50:44.750
Shopify, there are tons of different
platforms of eCommerce platforms.

00:50:46.710 --> 00:50:49.890
There is no one
straight answer to that.

00:50:49.890 --> 00:50:50.300
Sorry.

00:50:50.300 --> 00:50:51.960
>> JAY: Not a problem.

00:50:51.960 --> 00:50:52.210
All right.

00:50:52.210 --> 00:50:56.660
Well, thank you for the
session, and thank you everyone

00:50:56.660 --> 00:51:00.490
for attending the
session with Mike Ziemak.

00:51:00.490 --> 00:51:03.880
You can continue this
conversation in the chat or

00:51:03.880 --> 00:51:15.120
on social media using the
#WPA11yDay and #WP2022.

00:51:15.120 --> 00:51:15.980
We appreciate it.

00:51:15.980 --> 00:51:21.745
If you do go to
WPaccessibility.day/feedback

00:51:21.745 --> 00:51:25.616
to provide anonymous feedback for
our speakers on their presentation.

00:51:25.616 --> 00:51:30.190
I believe there's also a way for
you to enter in for a free t-shirt.

00:51:30.190 --> 00:51:35.520
Please stay tuned for our Lightning
Talks: Round 2 coming up next
