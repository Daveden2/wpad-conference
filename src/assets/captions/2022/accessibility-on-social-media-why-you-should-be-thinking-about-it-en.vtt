DEVIN EGGER: We have
Accessibility on Social Media -

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.330
Why You Should Be Thinking About
It, from Sam Alderson,

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:37.870
social media strategist at Yoast.

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:42.010
Sam, take it away.

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.900
SAM ALDERSON: Welcome,
if you're interested in accessibility

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.130
in social media then
you’re in the right place.

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:51.590
My name is Sam and I work for a
little WordPress called Yoast.

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:54.260
You'll find me on most of the
networks and I’m Good Plan, Sam

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.320
and I'm obsessed with
social and accessibility.

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.500
Let's look at today's
topics I am going to cover.

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:03.800
I can't stress enough that
there is so much more to this

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.230
than I can cover in today's talk.

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:08.180
I just want the cogs
turning and you thinking

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.680
about social
accessibility in media.

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.040
Why is this important?

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.990
People use social media daily,
and for me accessibility

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.150
at its absolute core
is about people.

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:22.690
Online accessibility is finally
starting to get a lot more attention

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:25.930
and that the people who use the
Internet are very different.

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:28.820
They access content and
services in different ways.

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.520
And I hope that if you take
one thing away from this is

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.190
to remember not to make
assumptions about those people

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:37.040
who are coming to
consume your content.

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.010
I'm going to share with you
how you can give your users,

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:43.660
readers, customers a choice
while designing for a diversity

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:46.473
of experiences and providing
different ways for people

00:01:46.474 --> 00:01:50.340
to participate
and interact with your content.

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.280
Offering your content in this way
means more users, more retweets,

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.740
followers, likes, link clicks.

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.280
Just to give you an idea
about how people interact

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.730
with social media here’s some fun
numbers because we all love stats.

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:09.200
Facebook reported in 2016, 85% of
people watch videos without sound.

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.720
They also found that 80%
of people who watch videos

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.970
with captions are more likely
to watch the entire video.

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:21.910
Similarly, YouTube found that
videos with captions had 10 percent

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:23.180
more view time.

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.290
The point is not that
captions are important,

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.060
though don’t get me wrong,
they definitely are.

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.740
It's that different people
consume content in different ways

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:32.850
and have different needs.

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.970
When you tweet, share or interact
in social media you cannot be sure

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:40.360
that the person on the other
side will fully understand

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:41.680
what you’ve sent.

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.770
And if the person cannot see,
read or engage with that content,

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:48.030
then you need to be
doing something about it.

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.600
You may be thinking, Yes,
Sam, I know all this already.

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.130
Where do I start?
Let's start with images.

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.620
A lot of what we do on the
social team at Yoast is visual

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.220
and designed to convey
a specific information.

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.300
For example, we use images to
tell a story, to convey a message

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.540
or to get people to take an action.

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.730
There are numerous, different
people consuming our content

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:13.210
in different ways who
have different challenges.

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:15.870
I have to say, though,
we have an outstanding design team

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.650
at Yoast that keeps everyone in
check when it comes to accessibility,

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:19.800
so a huge pops [phonetic]

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.060
to them.

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.220
What are some of the basics
to take into consideration

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:24.670
when it comes to images.

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:28.280
There are specific challenges that
come around with colour and contrast.

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:32.160
For example, you shouldn’t rely on
colour alone to convey a message.

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.800
If some of your audience was
colorblind, then the key information

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.800
in this chart may be
lost or change meaning.

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:41.680
This Instagram post relies on me
being able to see red versus green,

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.380
and to understand that green is
good, and red is bad.

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:48.900
But that the green is
also half of this chart.

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.430
This also relies on the cultural
context that red being bad

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:54.680
and green being good
which is not universal.

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:58.110
To make this post more
accessible, we need

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:01.000
to label the key information
we want to get across.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.050
That's better.

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:03.890
See how we’ve added
the percentages.

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:06.260
They may be small but it’s
something to keep in mind.

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:10.790
But this is more about catering
to those who are colorblind.

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:12.550
The colours that we use
in their relationships

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:16.120
to each other is also something
you need to take into account.

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:20.170
We can't assume that people see
images the same way that a person

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:22.760
with 20/20 vision sees them.

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:24.210
But thinking about
contrast can help.

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:26.640
I have taken most of the
color out of this image to see

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:29.280
how some people may experience it.

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.140
You can still identify
the key parts.

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:33.540
The message still makes
sense, but it's not perfect.

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:36.090
The contrast is not great
near the bottom of the image.

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:38.500
However, the key information
is still readable,

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.600
and the text is still readable.

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:42.650
This brings me on
to text in images.

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:44.510
It’s something, again,
that we do a lot at Yoast.

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:48.520
Almost all of our posts have
complex images with text on it.

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:51.200
There are guidelines and tools
that you can use to ensure

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:53.610
that the contrast ratios
of your text is sufficient

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:55.640
against the background colour.

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:58.630
Do note, though, there are
minimum contrast ratios based

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:01.980
on the different sizes of the
fonts that you use, so, be aware.

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:06.020
Other things to be mindful
of is that the text

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:08.860
in the image is inaccessible
to screen readers.

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:12.060
It's best practice to include
that text that’s in the image

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:13.620
in the caption of your post.

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:16.260
Next, let’s consider alt text.

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.180
This is text that is read aloud
by assistive technologies.

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:24.400
Images fall into three different
categories when it comes to alt text.

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:29.060
On social media, first, at least,
it's almost always informative.

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:31.390
First,
we have the informative images.

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:33.880
These are the ones
that convey meaning.

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:35.330
Next you have functional images.

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:38.460
Those have a specific role or
purpose, for example, a logo.

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:41.990
And then you have the decorative
ones, and these are just for show.

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:45.980
W3C has a handy decision tree that
you can use to help you figure out

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:48.360
which categories your
images fall into.

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:50.890
But social media is
almost always informative.

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:55.990
When it comes to alt text
what do you need to do.

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:59.110
There are a few best practices to
keep in mind when writing them.

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:02.570
Keeping it short is best,
writing proper sentences

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:07.390
and generally around 125 to 140
characters is the best way to go.

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:09.500
It’s effectively a short Tweet.

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:11.870
There are some platforms that
provide you with a lot of room

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:13.150
to write your alt text.

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:15.750
Twitter, for example, let’s
you write a thousand characters

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:17.400
if you really want to.

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:19.370
And with the surge of AI
images, this amount

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:21.760
of space can be super helpful.

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:25.500
All social platforms have this
function to add the alt text images,

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:27.990
and I will show you
where you can find those.

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:30.670
I'm going to share with you an
example of an Instagram post

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:32.926
from a while ago from our account.

00:06:32.926 --> 00:06:33.693
Here we go.

00:06:33.693 --> 00:06:34.130
This is now available.

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:36.550
Yoast SEO is now
available in Shopify.

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:37.960
Basically,
it’s the text in the image.

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:40.840
While it’s fine to actually
describe the image itself,

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:43.610
there is important context here
that we haven’t communicated

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:45.070
so let’s add some more.

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:47.550
Here you can see now we
have the text in the image

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:50.400
and a brief description
of the image itself.

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:51.490
But we could go further.

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:53.520
That’s much better.

00:06:54.147 --> 00:06:59.270
Do you see how adding extra layers
and context builds the picture.

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:02.260
You can prove this even further,
but this is much of an art

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:05.090
as it is a science,
so filling in something basic

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:09.210
is better than not doing it at all.

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:13.390
It gets you into the habit at
least of filling in these fields.

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:16.130
Remember that you have the
context of your images and photos.

00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:17.840
Describe them as if you
are talking to someone

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:19.380
who has never seen them before.

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:20.380
Utilize that.

00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:23.490
Here are best practices to
keep in mind when it comes

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:26.130
to alt text [on screen].

00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:27.130
Take screenshots.

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:32.160
Now we know what you should be
writing, but where do you add this.

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:34.400
This can, obviously, be done
directly in the platforms itself

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:35.140
and some [scheduling]

00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:37.990
services are now catching up and
actually adding this functionality

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:38.770
as well.

00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:41.900
I'm going to show you quickly how
to add an alt text to your images.

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:45.530
On Twitter you compose
your tweet like normal.

00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:47.630
You see that in the bottom,
right-hand corner you have

00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:49.270
the alt text button.

00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:51.960
You can write your description in
there and then you can save it.

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:54.410
This will show that the
image has an alt attribute.

00:07:55.450 --> 00:07:57.370
This has to be done
before you tweet.

00:07:57.370 --> 00:07:58.050
Do remember that.

00:07:58.050 --> 00:08:00.700
You cannot edit
this after the fact.

00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:03.050
One great thing that Twitter has
introduced is that you can turn

00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:06.490
on a notification that will
remind you to add an alt attribute

00:08:06.490 --> 00:08:09.130
before you actually
tweet your tweet.

00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:12.650
If you are tweeting out a photo, it
will remind you to add that alt text.

00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:14.460
It’s a big win.

00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:15.990
On Instagram it's a bit hidden.

00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:19.350
It’s in the advanced settings
so once you go there you need

00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:23.380
to then fill it in and save it,
but you can edit this after posting.

00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:26.140
On Facebook there's an AI
that can do this for you,

00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:27.290
but it can get it wrong.

00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:31.760
That's a practice to
actually write it yourself.

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:34.550
AI alt attributes are rarely good.

00:08:34.550 --> 00:08:37.450
They may do a reasonable job of
identifying what’s in the picture,

00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:40.000
but they lack your context.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.760
Let's talk videos,
especially short form video.

00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:44.360
They’re only getting bigger.

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:47.080
I can do a whole talk about
that, but that's not for today.

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:49.990
We’re seeing that TikTok is heavily
influencing our content consumption,

00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:52.710
and the other networks are
working hard to catch up.

00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:56.240
Facebook recently added
its version of TikTok.

00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:57.980
It’s the home feed.

00:08:57.980 --> 00:09:00.760
Video is here to stay
from a social perspective.

00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:03.380
It's good to remember that
YouTube is also a social network

00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:08.200
with a huge and diverse audience
that have very high standards

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:10.100
and very little patience.

00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:11.550
The small details matter.

00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:14.560
There's a lot to consider
when it comes to videos

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:17.900
but one of the easier things that
you can do is to add captions,

00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:19.950
also, titles to your videos.

00:09:19.950 --> 00:09:21.450
But what's the difference?

00:09:21.450 --> 00:09:24.870
Captions convey all the essential
audio, the dialogue, music,

00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:26.350
sound effects.

00:09:26.350 --> 00:09:30.040
They are intended for audiences
who cannot hear the audio.

00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:33.080
Subtitles, however,
convey the dialogue only.

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:34.980
They are intended for
an audience who can hear

00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:36.280
but not understand the audio.

00:09:37.390 --> 00:09:40.560
On social media these tend
to use interchangeably.

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:44.170
But outside of that they use
for more specific reasons.

00:09:44.170 --> 00:09:47.350
There also two types of
captions that you can use.

00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:50.710
You have the closed captions, meaning
a user can turn them on and off

00:09:50.710 --> 00:09:52.520
which gives them the choice.

00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:54.990
Or you have open captions
which actually are burnt

00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:58.140
into the video themselves, that
sometimes this can cause problems

00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:00.850
with subtitles actually
overlaying them.

00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:04.440
Every single platform has the ability
for you to add closed captions

00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:05.820
to your videos.

00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:09.000
Though sometimes they are
not formatted the best.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.810
Let's do a bit of a quick rundown.

00:10:11.810 --> 00:10:15.310
It's also worth noting that
subtitles make translation

00:10:15.310 --> 00:10:18.380
and localization a lot easier.

00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:21.680
YouTube can do this automatically,
however, you must review these.

00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:23.980
This is not 100% accurate.

00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:27.300
You need to pay attention to
the wording and the timings,

00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:29.900
especially if the person
talking has a thick accent.

00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:35.290
You can also upload an SRT file or
paste in a script if there is one.

00:10:35.290 --> 00:10:37.480
This will give you a much
more accurate result.

00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:40.370
Programs like the
script are a great help.

00:10:40.370 --> 00:10:43.230
Twitter can do it automatically,
but its hit and miss so stick

00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:46.850
with uploading the captions to
their Twitter media library.

00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:50.300
Instagram and TikTok also have
options to do closed captions.

00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:53.170
They are pretty accurate,
but you do need to edit them

00:10:53.170 --> 00:10:55.850
to make sure
everything makes sense.

00:10:55.850 --> 00:10:58.580
Instagram stories, however,
is not styled right

00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:00.060
and they're not exposed
to screen readers,

00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:01.970
so the text isn’t
available to everyone.

00:11:03.790 --> 00:11:07.710
With Facebook, again, you can trust
the AI, but this can still be hit

00:11:07.710 --> 00:11:09.130
or miss.

00:11:09.130 --> 00:11:13.270
Review these once the video has
been processed or upload an SRT file

00:11:13.270 --> 00:11:17.380
or the script to assure you
have them correct and concise.

00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:20.050
Okay, we’re on the home straight.

00:11:20.050 --> 00:11:23.130
And these three can be the
most annoying when it comes

00:11:23.130 --> 00:11:25.200
to social media accessibility.

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:27.030
First, we have emojis.

00:11:27.030 --> 00:11:31.110
Emojis have a text description
like an alt attribute meaning

00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:35.330
that this is actually read
aloud by assistive programs.

00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:37.880
This meme from a couple of
years ago is a great example

00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:40.160
of how not to use emojis.

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:42.540
I perceive this visually
to be red flags.

00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:47.860
However, a user with a screen reader
this says, I’m not on Twitter,

00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:50.960
triangle flag, triangle flag,
triangle flag, triangle flag,

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:52.970
you get my point.

00:11:52.970 --> 00:11:56.660
If you’re going to use emojis,
make sure you use them at the end

00:11:56.660 --> 00:11:59.162
of your copy or if
it’s between sentences,

00:11:59.163 --> 00:12:00.850
make sure they have context.

00:12:00.850 --> 00:12:05.160
When it comes to hashtags,
please use CamelCase.

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:07.550
Basically,
capitalizing each word in the tag.

00:12:07.550 --> 00:12:11.790
It helps the word to breathe when
read aloud by assistive technologies.

00:12:11.790 --> 00:12:15.820
It also means screen readers will
read it out as singular words

00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:17.980
as opposed to one contained word.

00:12:19.110 --> 00:12:20.846
Here's an example of a hashtag

00:12:20.847 --> 00:12:23.450
that has gone down in
social media history.

00:12:23.450 --> 00:12:28.050
They still blow up as an
example of what not to do.

00:12:28.050 --> 00:12:31.830
Also, note that acronyms
and initialisms like SEO,

00:12:31.830 --> 00:12:34.060
should always be capitalized.

00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:35.670
Custom fonts.

00:12:35.670 --> 00:12:36.790
Oh, custom fonts.

00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:39.430
Custom fonts were very
trendy back in the '90s.

00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:43.080
They seem to have come back
into trend every now and then.

00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:45.300
I don't know about you, but this
makes me really shake my head

00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:47.440
when I see people do
this because it tells me

00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:51.100
the person doing this really does
not understand accessibility at all.

00:12:53.250 --> 00:12:56.150
Screen readers cannot
process this as text.

00:12:56.150 --> 00:13:00.040
They will often mistake this for
math or worse they’ll just ignore it,

00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:03.750
which means you're neglecting
a huge chunk of your audience.

00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:05.730
This also goes for ASCII art.

00:13:07.010 --> 00:13:10.430
While this is cute for me,
this is very exclusionary.

00:13:10.430 --> 00:13:12.990
Please think about
this before you do it.

00:13:12.990 --> 00:13:15.870
Think about the person who
is consuming your content.

00:13:15.870 --> 00:13:18.390
I know that was a lot of information
in a short amount of time,

00:13:18.390 --> 00:13:21.460
but this is something that we
should all be thinking about

00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:22.850
in order to be inclusive.

00:13:24.510 --> 00:13:26.680
This is only the tip
of the iceberg as well.

00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:29.900
Like I said at the beginning,
there is a lot to this,

00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:32.790
but once you know, you
know, and you start spotting

00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:35.440
all the people doing
these mistakes.

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:37.710
Here are just a few
takeaways from this talk

00:13:37.710 --> 00:13:40.920
and I hope you're enjoying the rest
of the WordPress accessibility today.

00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:41.920
Thanks for listening.
