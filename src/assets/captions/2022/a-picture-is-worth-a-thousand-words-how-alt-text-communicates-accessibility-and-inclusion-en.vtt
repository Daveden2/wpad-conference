00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.870
<v Devin Egger> The very first
one will be from Empish Thomas,

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.340
freelance writer and blogger.

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.830
This presentation is titled,
A Picture is Worth a Thousand Words:

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:42.990
How Alt Text Communicates
Accessibility and Inclusion.

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:43.690
I hope you enjoy.

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:44.511
Thank you.

00:00:50.017 --> 00:00:54.010
<v Empish Thomas> Hello,
and welcome to my presentation,

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.640
A Picture is Worth a
Thousand Words: How Alt Text

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.910
Communicates Accessibility
and Inclusion.

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.940
My name is Empish.

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.240
I'm a black woman with
gray-brown, shoulder-length hair

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.360
and light-brown eyes.

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:16.200
I am wearing a blue,
short sleeve blazer with a pink top

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.690
and pearl jewelry.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.940
Many of us know a picture
is worth a thousand words.

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:29.990
And we also know the value images,
graphics, and pictures bring

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.190
to a blog or website.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:37.530
Eye-catching images
enhance any website.

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.380
Yet for those with vision
loss, those very images

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:48.550
can communicate exclusion
if alt text is not provided.

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:58.699
As a blind blogger and manager of a
WordPress website I know firsthand

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.620
how important it is to have
alt text to describe images.

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:08.490
I am online daily and when
images are not described,

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:14.010
it hinders my overall experience
and interaction with that website.

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:21.110
In this presentation I will share
how providing alt text makes

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:27.110
for a more accessible and inclusive
experience for your visitor.

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.190
I will give the definition,
some best practices

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:36.150
while sharing my personal
experience with alt text.

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.090
Now, definition of alt text.

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:45.310
But before I do the definition,
alt text is also known as alt tags

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.490
or alt description.

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:51.340
So those names can be
used interchangeably.

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:57.550
Alt text is a short written
description of an image on a webpage.

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:05.860
These descriptions can define
photos, graphics, GIFs or videos.

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:11.590
Basically, any information
with visual content needs

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.460
to have audio description.

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:20.280
This text allows screen-reading
software to describe those images

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.200
for those of us with vision loss.

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.640
I use a screen reader daily.

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:30.700
And when I come across an image, my
screen reader will relay that image

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.100
to me.

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:37.000
If there is no alt text though,
my screen reader will say,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.990
graphic image with no
alt text displayed.

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:45.620
What that tells me is
there is an image there,

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:48.580
but I don’t have any
idea what to do with it,

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:50.790
how to engage with it or anything.

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:56.800
Although accessibility is
the main focus of my talk,

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:01.067
alt text also provides
some additional features

00:04:01.068 --> 00:04:03.200
I want to alert you to.

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:08.160
Number one, it allows search
engines to rank your website.

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:13.550
Browsers like Google can use
those alt text descriptions

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:19.600
to better understand visual
content affecting your page ranking

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.040
and search results.

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:28.000
Number two, it enhances the overall
user experience for anyone coming

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.520
to your site regardless
of disability.

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:38.690
Now, how to add alt text
to your website or blog.

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:46.470
One of the best ways to add
alt text in WordPress is

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:49.010
through the media library.

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:54.070
When you upload a photo or
image into your media library,

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:56.910
that image can be edited.

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:03.250
In the editing section there will be
a box that will be labeled alt text.

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:06.690
And in that box you can
type in your description.

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:10.220
But what do you write in that box?

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:12.690
This is a really good question.

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:16.030
Here are some best
practices for what to write

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:18.840
for your alt text description.

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:22.280
Number one, think about
the purpose of your image.

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:23.940
Why are you using it.

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:27.000
And what do you want
it to communicate.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:33.010
Number two, describe the
actual content of that image.

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:39.520
Number three, don’t begin with
phrases that begin like picture of,

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:42.250
photo of, image of.

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:48.480
Just go right into the content
and describe your image.

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:53.050
Number four, keep it
short, sweet, and simple.

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:57.830
I have found from my personal
experience and research

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:03.260
when writing descriptions,
it can be subjective.

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:10.060
What I mean is, there is no one
specific way to write alt text.

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:15.770
But what you can do is think about
your audience, your loyal fans,

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:20.260
and subscribers, and any new
people coming to your site

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:23.600
and what they want.

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:28.410
Here are some additional best
practices on alt text to consider.

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:34.230
Number one, don't stuff
keywords in the alt text field.

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:47.860
Although you can enhance your SEO,
stuffing keywords can be complicated

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:50.900
and difficult to
understand for those of us

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:53.010
using screen- reading technology.

00:06:55.950 --> 00:07:00.570
Number two, don't use all caps.

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:06.480
Some screen readers can interpret
all caps as one word which,

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:09.980
again, makes it complicated,
and difficult for people

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:14.070
with vision impairment
using reading technology.

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:18.400
Number three,
describe race and gender.

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:21.200
I recommend describing
race and gender

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:25.800
because it communicates
diversity and inclusion.

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:31.230
A sighted person can view this
image and a blind person should have

00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:36.120
the same equal access
to that information.

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:40.740
When you don't describe race and
gender, white and male is assumed

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:42.920
to be the default.

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:49.490
And it, also, can be misleading,
misrepresent, and even be inaccurate.

00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:56.890
If you need images, WordPress has
a stock-photo catalog or library

00:07:56.890 --> 00:08:01.570
where you can pick out really
great diverse and inclusive images

00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:04.420
for your website or blog.

00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:08.630
Number four,
describe the text in your image.

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:13.520
It is not guaranteed a screen
reader will pick up the text

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:15.430
within an image.

00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:21.260
Include the text as part of
your alt text description.

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:24.110
Okay, example of what I mean.

00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:27.570
You have an image of
a woman holding a sign

00:08:27.570 --> 00:08:30.610
and on that sign
there is some text.

00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:34.170
When you write your alt
text description, you need

00:08:34.170 --> 00:08:38.510
to also include the text
that is on that sign.

00:08:40.153 --> 00:08:44.742
Number five, describe
complicated images like maps,

00:08:44.742 --> 00:08:47.740
charts and diagrams.

00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:52.080
Follow best practices for
following complicated images,

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:55.010
and here's two things to consider.

00:08:55.010 --> 00:08:59.310
First, write a short
description of the image.

00:08:59.310 --> 00:09:03.820
Just a typical alt text
description you would do.

00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:10.520
Number two, write a longer text
with more essential details.

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:14.310
You can even include a
link where visitors can go

00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:20.270
for more information on that
map or diagram or chart.

00:09:20.270 --> 00:09:23.950
Six, describe form buttons.

00:09:25.070 --> 00:09:28.870
Form buttons for social
media and subscription,

00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:33.700
e-mail subscriptions need
to have a description.

00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:36.576
So that those of us with
vision impairment can know

00:09:36.576 --> 00:09:38.180
what action to take.

00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:46.670
When I have gone to a site, my screen
reader will say, unlabeled button.

00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:50.100
This again tells me something
is there, but I don't know

00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:53.120
what to do with it,
what action to take.

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:57.340
Most of the time I don't do anything
which is not the result you want.

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:04.990
In conclusion, this presentation I
shared the definition of alt text

00:10:04.990 --> 00:10:09.100
and its importance when it
comes to accessibility, traffic,

00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:11.930
and user experience.

00:10:11.930 --> 00:10:17.750
Understanding these reasons will
help you write the best alt text,

00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:21.530
resulting in accessible
and inclusive website

00:10:21.530 --> 00:10:25.830
because a picture is
worth a thousand words.

00:10:25.830 --> 00:10:29.860
Thank you so much for your time
and listening to my presentation.
