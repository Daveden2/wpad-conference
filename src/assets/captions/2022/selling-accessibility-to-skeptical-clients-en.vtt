00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:36.760
<v Amber Hinds> Hello, and welcome
to WordPress Accessibility Day.

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:41.280
My name is Amber Hinds,
I am one of the lead organizers

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.560
of WordPress Accessibility
Day, and I'm the CEO

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.810
of a company called
Equalize Digital.

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:48.610
I'm here to welcome
you today to a session

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:52.440
that is a panel discussion
called, Selling Accessibility

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.560
to Skeptical Clients.

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:58.180
On this panel discussion,
we have Colleen Grat-- Excuse me.

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.600
We have Colleen Gratzer,
who is an accessibility educator,

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.238
specialist,
and designer with Creative Boost

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:07.340
and Gratzer Graphics LLC.

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:12.480
Chris Hinds, who is also one of
our organizers, and he is the COO

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.180
of Equalize Digital.

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:19.120
Rob Howard will be leading the
panel, he is the CEO of HDC.

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:26.360
Please feel free to add any
questions in the Q&A tab in Slido,

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:31.130
which is the chat that you see to the
right of the video on our website.

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.010
If you want to discuss
with other attendees,

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:38.160
you can also use the
ideas section in Slido.

00:01:39.066 --> 00:01:40.334
Thanks so much.

00:01:43.637 --> 00:01:44.250
ROB HOWARD: Hi, everyone.

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:44.810
Welcome.

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:46.900
As Amber mentioned, I'm Rob Howard.

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.800
I'm here with Chris Hinds
and Colleen Gratzer.

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:55.630
We all run various types of digital
agencies where we sell accessibility

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.690
as well as design and
development services.

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.300
One of the challenges that we
often face as business owners

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:09.390
who are selling web services is
that while we and probably most

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:14.140
of the attendees here at WP
Accessibility Day already get it

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.470
and understand the reasoning
behind why your website needs

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.900
to go the extra mile to be
accessible to everyone, a lot

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.220
of clients don't understand
that and they often come back

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:31.840
with some range of objections
or feedback along the lines of,

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.650
I don't really understand
why we should do this,

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.770
or why we should spend money on
this, or why I used

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:38.300
to do this now versus later.

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.080
Chris and Colleen and
I are going to chat

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.250
for the next hour or so
about different strategies

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:48.050
for what I would call Selling
Accessibility to Skeptical Clients.

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:52.560
We're going to unpack a
lot of different approaches

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.710
and sales tactics, but also talk
about why clients are skeptical

00:02:55.710 --> 00:03:02.650
and also dig into why you might
actually need to do a sales pitch

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.920
to help your client understand
that they should comply

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.710
with the law, for example,
or have a product or service

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:12.100
that's open to everybody.

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:15.310
One of my one of the things
I'm most excited to talk

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:20.330
about is this idea of, well,
I don't want to have to sell it,

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:26.630
it's a little bit sleazy or sketchy
to have to go sell inclusion

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:30.970
to other people but here we
are and there are clients

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:36.010
who say stuff like, for
example, I had an experience

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:40.090
with a designer who literally said
the words, "I'm not colorblind,

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:42.770
I like this color scheme."

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:47.008
I was like, okay, well,
after everybody's picked their job

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:48.420
off the floor.

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:52.180
We were like, we need to
actually figure out how to

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:56.200
either persuade this person or take
over control of the decision-making

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.870
because this can't go
forward in this way.

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:02.630
Let's dive in a little bit.

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:08.290
I mentioned an extreme and
offensive objection but usually,

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:12.970
the objections are really not
quite that overt, it's more like

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:14.880
I don't have the budget for
it right now, stuff like that.

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:22.030
Colleen, if you have any, I'd love
to hear some objections you've heard

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:26.220
from clients where it's like, hey,
I'm not necessarily saying out loud

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:29.310
that I'm never going to do
this but also, I'm not going

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:32.380
to fork over the money
for it right now.

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:35.860
For the clients who come to
you for design development

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:39.400
or other services who
are not already on board

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:43.187
with building an
accessibility-friendly site,

00:04:43.188 --> 00:04:47.522
what kind of responses or
languages are you hearing from them

00:04:47.523 --> 00:04:48.990
in their objections?

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.360
<v Colleen Gratzer> Well,
one thing is definitely cost.

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.040
They might say it's too expensive.

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:58.450
One thing that I will
bring up is that okay,

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:01.890
our process includes
building an accessible site

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:05.460
and if they're not willing to
pay for it, we're not going

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:09.075
to change our process to
do a non-accessible site,

00:05:09.075 --> 00:05:09.980
an inaccessible site.

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:15.070
What I will tell them is that
we'll do our usual process

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:18.090
which is going to increase
the accessibility of your site

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:20.510
but unless you pay for it,
we're not going to go in

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:23.470
and write alt text and add alt
text to images, we're not going

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:28.000
to go remediate page content
because that can take weeks

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.620
at a time and also requires
some of their feedback sometimes

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:32.220
with the alt text.

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:36.190
I use that too as a selling point
because then they know that at least,

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:38.460
they're going to get
some accessibility

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:40.260
because it's just
something we already do.

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:44.180
Definitely, I hear that about cost.

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:47.140
Another big one I hear is,
"Oh, we don't serve anyone

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:52.880
with a disability" and then
I educate them about that

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:57.230
and about the percentages of people
with certain types of disabilities.

00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:00.020
I mention a few disabilities and
sometimes, they're usually like,

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:02.170
"Oh, I hadn't thought about that."

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:05.030
Another one that I've heard,
and I have a lot of designers

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:07.710
who are clients too,
so I do hear this quite a bit,

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:12.200
is accessibility is ugly, or I'm
going to have to use dark colors.

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:16.190
I actually had a client
who's not a designer,

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:18.790
we were designing something
for them for an email,

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:21.410
and they sent us their brand
color palette and decided

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:23.893
to not send us their lighter
colors because they didn't think

00:06:23.894 --> 00:06:25.550
we'd be able
to use them.

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:27.920
Then they wondered,
why is the design so dark?

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:31.200
You realize you didn't
send me all the colors.

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:37.200
Those are usually the big
things that I hear about.

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:39.940
I haven't heard this myself
but I have heard this

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:43.880
from other web designers,
is that their clients sometimes go

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:49.110
with an overlay which is awful.

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:51.750
ROB: I'm sure we're not
the only ones who will talk

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:55.982
about the sort of superficial
JavaScript buttons

00:06:55.982 --> 00:07:00.240
that theoretically help
but don't always actually help.

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:04.600
Before I kick it over to Chris,
I'll add that we actually had

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:07.700
a really big client who is
a well-known national brand

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:11.550
that everybody will know
and they have a color scheme

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:16.200
that mixes light blue and dark
blue, and some of those light blues

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:19.070
were intended to have white
button text over them,

00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:21.710
and they just never were
going to get anywhere close

00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:23.780
to hitting that contrast goal.

00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:26.710
We see this with orange a lot
too, it's very difficult

00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:28.220
to hit the right contrast.

00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:34.540
Designers will often come in
with the opposite idea like,

00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:37.150
oh, I should have a white
text and an orange button,

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:39.160
but really needs to be black.

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:40.989
Anyway,
there are some national brands

00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:42.630
that they've had this color scheme

00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:45.303
for decades,
and it's just not going

00:07:45.304 --> 00:07:47.470
to fit our current standards.

00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:53.930
In that conversation,
there was really no feasible way

00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:59.890
that we could go back to the
national multi-billion dollar brand

00:07:59.890 --> 00:08:02.830
and be like,
change your blue for the website.

00:08:02.830 --> 00:08:07.130
We did use an overlay, but it
was very much like a last resort.

00:08:08.170 --> 00:08:11.070
Chris, I'm curious if you could
speak to that same question.

00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:15.750
What kind of objections or
ways to wiggle out of it

00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:17.690
that you hear from
potential clients?

00:08:18.758 --> 00:08:21.260
<v Chris Hinds> Colleen you
covered some of the major ones.

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:23.350
As you were talking, I was
checking things that I was going

00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:24.580
to mention off of my list.

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:29.610
Some of the softer ones
though that we hear at times,

00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:32.240
they're not as overt
of an objection.

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:36.240
One of them is, "I get that
accessibility is important.

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:39.880
I personally sympathize with that
but can we just do it later?"

00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:45.590
That's one that we hear pretty often,
"Can we just do it as an add-on?"

00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:49.070
The answer that we generally
provide on that one is

00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:53.070
that you could do it later,
it will be more expensive

00:08:53.070 --> 00:08:56.980
to do later versus considering
it at every phase of the project

00:08:56.980 --> 00:08:58.790
and shifting left
with accessibility.

00:08:59.870 --> 00:09:03.430
Beyond that, one other one
I've heard a few times as well,

00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:06.500
"I don't understand why I need to do
this because I'm not in government.

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:09.140
I'm not in the government
sector or the higher ed sector.

00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:12.820
I'm not an elementary school,
why do I have to care about this?"

00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:16.940
I think that there is just a little
bit of education depending on

00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:20.200
where you are, where your Nexus
is as a company, there are laws

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:21.280
that may actually apply to you.

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:28.390
A couple other ones,
one that we hear a lot of is,

00:09:28.390 --> 00:09:32.030
"It seems like accessibility
just adds cost for no benefit,"

00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:35.680
which is dovetails with the whole,
"it's too expensive" mindset

00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:38.850
and I think that just comes down
to which I'll touch on more later

00:09:38.850 --> 00:09:40.750
if I get the opportunity,
like helping them see

00:09:40.751 --> 00:09:41.740
what those benefits are.

00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:44.690
Rob, I think you have some
questions geared towards that.

00:09:44.690 --> 00:09:47.280
Then finally,
and I don't remember if this was one

00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:49.000
that Colleen mentioned
already or not but one

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.020
that I've heard before is,
well, the people who rely

00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:54.520
on this assistive technology,
they aren't our customers.

00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:56.470
They don't use our service,
they don't use our product,

00:09:56.470 --> 00:09:58.440
they don't use our website.

00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:02.040
I think that in that instance,
it's just a lack of imagination

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:05.620
or a lack of understanding
that we are all aging

00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:08.110
into needing this technology.

00:10:08.110 --> 00:10:12.070
Even if we're typically able
now, that may not be the case

00:10:12.071 --> 00:10:13.390
in the future.

00:10:13.390 --> 00:10:18.243
I think, in that case,
it's just helping them visualize

00:10:18.244 --> 00:10:21.150
a different future for
themselves and their customers

00:10:21.151 --> 00:10:22.710
where that may be necessary.

00:10:22.710 --> 00:10:25.200
Those were the major ones that
I didn't think quite got touched

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:26.470
on that were front of mind for me.

00:10:27.093 --> 00:10:31.240
ROB: You brought up a
couple that I think dive into

00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:33.332
what I think is really one
of the most salient parts

00:10:33.333 --> 00:10:34.200
of this conversation.

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:37.783
Really, the biggest challenge
for business owners is

00:10:37.784 --> 00:10:40.920
there's this idea of, well,
it's going to cost more later.

00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:42.850
There's this idea of, "Well,
I'm not in government."

00:10:42.850 --> 00:10:47.120
I think what those both
apply into is that now

00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:50.520
that the government has,
in the United States,

00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:53.480
explicitly said they're going
to enforce the Americans

00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:59.730
with Disabilities Act on websites,
that introduces a whole new layer

00:10:59.730 --> 00:11:04.300
of potential costs and it
introduces a whole new group

00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:08.510
of companies that are
subject to that law.

00:11:08.510 --> 00:11:14.660
When I think about it,
I think about physical space having

00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:18.090
a wheelchair ramp in a
building or an elevator

00:11:18.090 --> 00:11:23.540
that is wheelchair accessible
is a significant upfront expense

00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:29.070
for any builder, for any store
owner, business owner, et cetera.

00:11:29.070 --> 00:11:34.520
Someone has to create that
object, install it, think about

00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:36.680
where it's going to fit in
the architecture, and all that

00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:42.030
but I think we culturally
accept that it is a requirement

00:11:42.030 --> 00:11:42.890
and a necessity.

00:11:42.890 --> 00:11:45.420
I don't think that there's
people out there who are like,

00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:49.110
"Ugh, I'm building this school
and I have to put an elevator in.

00:11:50.750 --> 00:11:54.580
This elevator has to be wide
enough for certain purposes."

00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:57.360
There are some older
historic buildings

00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:00.160
that still have significant
issues with that.

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:04.630
Certainly, there is a margin
in edge cases around that.

00:12:04.630 --> 00:12:08.180
We can pretty much say that
it's universally understood

00:12:08.180 --> 00:12:11.940
that you should have wheelchair ramps
or other wheelchair accessibility

00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:14.380
in your physical buildings.

00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:20.860
There is an eventual future
where we will we'll all have

00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:24.440
that same basic upfront
understanding for websites,

00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:25.890
but we're not there yet.

00:12:25.890 --> 00:12:30.210
We're at a place where imagine they
just passed the wheelchair ramp law

00:12:30.210 --> 00:12:32.120
and all the business owners are
like, "Oh my gosh, I have

00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:35.110
to update my whole store"
and all this other stuff.

00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:40.470
I'm curious, Colleen,
I'll go to you first.

00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:44.820
To what degree do you bring
in the legal aspect to this?

00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:47.200
Because I have clients
who have come to me

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:50.350
after getting threatening
letters or paying settlements.

00:12:51.470 --> 00:12:55.900
Obviously, that is a very
negative experience for them.

00:12:55.900 --> 00:13:00.650
We want to parlé that
into a positive outcome

00:13:00.650 --> 00:13:02.600
but that's a very delicate balance.

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:10.130
How do approach clients who may
be skeptical around the fence?

00:13:10.130 --> 00:13:12.990
Do you talk about the
threat of a lawsuit?

00:13:12.990 --> 00:13:15.620
Do you talk about other
clients who've gotten sued?

00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:18.350
How do you approach that in
a way that is constructive

00:13:18.350 --> 00:13:25.810
without being overly aggressive and
without making it seem like it's

00:13:26.990 --> 00:13:30.600
the "frivolous
lawsuit" type of thing?

00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:33.150
<v Colleen> I do bring
up examples and I do talk

00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:36.830
about the legal aspect because I
feel like because I know about it,

00:13:36.830 --> 00:13:40.400
I'm not doing them any
favors by not bringing it up.

00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:42.090
It really needs to come out.

00:13:42.090 --> 00:13:43.450
There's no tip-toeing around it.

00:13:43.450 --> 00:13:46.460
At the same time,
I don't want to bring it up in a way

00:13:46.460 --> 00:13:49.750
that is going to make
them feel forced into it.

00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:53.080
I don't want to feel like
a sleazy salesperson.

00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:57.900
I don't approach it that way,
I just bring it up nested in

00:13:57.900 --> 00:13:59.960
with the other benefits of it.

00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:03.510
Then I will also talk about
the legal aspects as just one

00:14:03.510 --> 00:14:06.690
of those things but the other
ones are more positive benefits.

00:14:06.690 --> 00:14:09.260
I bring it into
more positive light.

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:12.800
I bring all of that up,
and we'll talk about it.

00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:17.010
What you were saying about
wheelchairs, a lot of people think

00:14:17.010 --> 00:14:20.870
that accessibility as
wheelchairs and blind people.

00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:23.100
You can see if somebody
is in a wheelchair.

00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:26.290
We can see if somebody is
walking with a seeing-eye dog,

00:14:26.290 --> 00:14:29.720
but we don't see the people
that are coming to the websites.

00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:34.200
I think a lot of that is educating
the client so they understand that,

00:14:35.410 --> 00:14:37.980
and then they make
better decisions.

00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:40.800
Yes, I definitely will
bring up the legal aspect.

00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:45.090
I don't go crazy with it,
but I will talk about that.

00:14:45.090 --> 00:14:49.200
I do bring it up with
a lot of other reasons.

00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:50.022
[chuckles]

00:14:50.022 --> 00:14:54.230
ROB: Imagine an architect and
developer comes to the architect

00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:57.210
and says, "I really want
to build this building,

00:14:57.210 --> 00:15:00.450
but I'd rather it not
have a wheelchair ramp."

00:15:00.450 --> 00:15:03.760
The architect will just say, "No.

00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:06.850
What's wrong with you?" When
you say that to a web developer

00:15:06.850 --> 00:15:10.510
or web designer,
now we have to go into a debate.

00:15:10.510 --> 00:15:16.200
When I think about it,
my vision for the future is, I want

00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:18.200
to be the architect who's
like, "Just no."

00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:24.080
I'll talk a little bit later
about how we are starting

00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:26.850
to work that stuff into our
contract and give us more control

00:15:26.850 --> 00:15:28.470
over stuff like that.

00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:33.010
For me, I'm like, you couldn't
do all these other things

00:15:33.010 --> 00:15:36.430
and just exclude the Americans
with Disabilities Act

00:15:36.430 --> 00:15:37.430
from your consideration.

00:15:39.210 --> 00:15:42.540
It seems like a lot of clients
still feel like it's optional.

00:15:43.770 --> 00:15:44.870
Chris, what about you?

00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:55.220
How do you bring the recent legal
changes or legal clarifications

00:15:55.220 --> 00:15:58.240
into your sales pitches to clients?

00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:00.730
<v Chris> To echo what you all
said, I do my best

00:16:00.730 --> 00:16:03.810
to put a positive spin on
it because we do get people

00:16:03.810 --> 00:16:07.110
that come to us that have
gotten a letter, or they're--

00:16:07.110 --> 00:16:10.910
All business owners know one
another within their circles.

00:16:10.910 --> 00:16:14.360
If they didn't get a letter,
someone in their circle did.

00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:16.810
We do hear some moaning
and groaning about it.

00:16:16.810 --> 00:16:21.720
I think the most powerful thing
to say in those situations is,

00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:25.320
"Do I agree with you
that it is unfortunate?"

00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:29.800
This is my own personal
opinion, that a small number

00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:35.280
of opportunistic law firms nationwide
are using predatory tactics

00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:38.830
to target businesses when
maybe, in certain situations,

00:16:38.830 --> 00:16:42.630
there's no actual harm to an
individual person taking place.

00:16:42.630 --> 00:16:45.140
They're looking to make a quick
buck or a quick settlement.

00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:47.570
What I always say is,
"I think that's unfortunate,

00:16:47.570 --> 00:16:49.880
I think it gives accessibility
a bad name because there are

00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:52.632
so many benefits both to
your customers and to you,

00:16:52.633 --> 00:16:53.690
the business owner.

00:16:53.690 --> 00:16:59.110
With accessibility, that get
washed over or get covered up

00:16:59.110 --> 00:17:02.230
because of this negative press
and these negative things

00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:03.230
that are occurring.

00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:05.890
I try to shift it positively.

00:17:07.580 --> 00:17:11.910
I also try to, as quickly as I
can, we do touch on legality early

00:17:11.910 --> 00:17:14.059
in the sales process,
we talk about business nexus,

00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:16.955
where they're located, what sort
of laws might apply to them,

00:17:16.956 --> 00:17:19.060
and even extending
beyond accessibility.

00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:21.260
We talk about GDPR and
some other things as well.

00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:25.210
That's just part of our normal
sales discovery process.

00:17:25.210 --> 00:17:26.820
We try to set the
precedent early on.

00:17:26.820 --> 00:17:29.930
It's like, okay, legal rest
mitigation is part of our process.

00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:34.850
We very quickly try to pivot that
into or away from the negatives

00:17:34.850 --> 00:17:36.130
of accessibility.

00:17:36.130 --> 00:17:39.110
What I do is, I just start,
like any good salesperson does,

00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:40.350
we ask about their goals.

00:17:40.350 --> 00:17:41.150
What are your objectives?

00:17:41.150 --> 00:17:42.480
What do you want to do?

00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:45.480
What outcomes is this new
website creating for you?

00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:50.300
It is very simple, typically,
to find some way to tie accessibility

00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:53.260
into what their actual stated
goals are in their own words.

00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:56.140
If they have objectives
that are around SEO,

00:17:56.140 --> 00:17:58.830
that are around improving
their user experience,

00:17:58.830 --> 00:18:02.250
increasing conversions,
just modernizing their web presence,

00:18:02.250 --> 00:18:06.390
accessibility can be tied to
all of that in some fashion.

00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:11.320
Getting them to align with
you versus doing this thing,

00:18:12.330 --> 00:18:15.440
getting them to understand, "Oh,
accessibility completely aligns

00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:16.210
with my goals.

00:18:16.210 --> 00:18:17.210
I need to do this."

00:18:18.130 --> 00:18:22.800
That is, to me,
the golden goose egg that I'm after.

00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:26.200
Sometimes it's achievable,
sometimes it isn't.

00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:28.220
It depends on the person's mindset.

00:18:28.220 --> 00:18:32.350
The other thing I'll say is I
think a lot of this will be unique

00:18:32.350 --> 00:18:37.000
to your company depending on
what you're selling websites for.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:40.460
If it's your own small agency or
you're stalling for a larger agency

00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:43.570
and you're attending this talk
today, it's going to be down

00:18:43.570 --> 00:18:46.380
to the audience that
you're attracting.

00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:50.840
I'm in the unique and fortunate
position that, a lot of the people

00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:53.550
that come to us because
Equalize Digital specializes

00:18:53.550 --> 00:18:56.950
in WordPress accessibility,
because we have accesibility checker,

00:18:56.950 --> 00:18:58.760
our scanning tool that's out there.

00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:00.900
A lot of people that come to
us, they know about us

00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:01.970
because of accessibility.

00:19:01.970 --> 00:19:04.780
They already have the right
mindset and the right reasons

00:19:04.780 --> 00:19:07.720
for wanting their
website to be accessible.

00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:10.560
I find that as time goes
on, I'm having

00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:12.930
to have this conversation
less and less, but I think

00:19:12.930 --> 00:19:15.540
some of that is more down
to the kind of people

00:19:15.540 --> 00:19:18.000
that we're attracting versus
another business might attract.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:19.223
<v Colleen> 100%.

00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:23.910
<v Chris> If you're working with
primarily SMBs, it's probably more

00:19:23.910 --> 00:19:27.550
of an uphill battle for
you than it is for me.

00:19:27.550 --> 00:19:30.280
I would just go back to just
try to tie it with their goals

00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:31.050
in whatever way you can.

00:19:32.104 --> 00:19:33.820
ROB: Colleen, I know we
talked a bit about SEO too.

00:19:33.820 --> 00:19:35.990
Could you expand upon
that idea and how

00:19:35.990 --> 00:19:43.370
some of these more well-established
goals parallel with accessibility?

00:19:43.370 --> 00:19:46.910
I think really, what it comes
down to is when people think SEO,

00:19:46.910 --> 00:19:49.290
they see themselves
making more money.

00:19:49.290 --> 00:19:52.080
Whereas when people
think accessibility,

00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:54.430
they see themselves spending money.

00:19:54.430 --> 00:19:59.420
In other words, i's an expense
versus an income or an investment.

00:19:59.420 --> 00:20:02.630
Are there other areas or
do you want to go deeper

00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:08.920
into that idea about how the
well-known moneymakers often parallel

00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:11.900
with accessibility, and we
can tie those things together?

00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:17.540
<v Colleen> If the content on the
site is formatted excessively,

00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:22.080
then it's going to work better
for SEO, and not just that,

00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:25.890
but think of it as not just
somebody finding the website,

00:20:25.890 --> 00:20:31.430
but finding more relevant content,
then staying on that site longer,

00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:35.060
and not just bouncing off
because it was formatted properly

00:20:35.060 --> 00:20:38.190
and somebody was able to find what
they were actually looking for.

00:20:38.190 --> 00:20:42.550
The other thing too is that
Google could give the site a boost

00:20:42.550 --> 00:20:46.880
with search engine rank because
it is faster than another site.

00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:48.870
It gives a leg up there too.

00:20:50.170 --> 00:20:53.640
ROB: The other thing that I've
noticed recently as something

00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:57.560
that is just a good user
experience but also is clearly

00:20:57.560 --> 00:21:00.720
an accessibility boost,
is captions and transcripts,

00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:02.870
right on podcasts, videos.

00:21:04.590 --> 00:21:08.450
There are a lot of times when I'm
idly scrolling through my phone

00:21:08.450 --> 00:21:12.750
but I don't want to listen to a
speech, or whatever I'm looking

00:21:12.750 --> 00:21:16.400
at on Twitter or Instagram or
whatever, but if it has captions,

00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:20.810
I can keep my volume down
and still get it Obviously,

00:21:20.810 --> 00:21:23.638
those captions double as an
accessibility feature but,

00:21:23.639 --> 00:21:26.437
in that case,
it's also just a convenience

00:21:26.438 --> 00:21:28.910
or a positive user
experience feature

00:21:28.910 --> 00:21:31.640
even for somebody who is able
to hear but just doesn't want

00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:33.360
to turn that volume
up at that moment.

00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:36.250
I think for our Press
the Issue podcast,

00:21:36.250 --> 00:21:40.440
we have been putting the
full transcript on the page

00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:42.520
of the podcast episode.

00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:47.230
That doubles as an SEO thing,
that's an accessibility thing.

00:21:47.230 --> 00:21:49.590
Also, sometimes I just want
to go back and find something

00:21:49.590 --> 00:21:50.300
that I said-

00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:51.080
<v Colleen> Exactly.

00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:51.240
Right.

00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:51.450
[chuckles]

00:21:51.450 --> 00:21:53.740
ROB: -three months ago in the
podcast and I can just Ctrl+F

00:21:53.740 --> 00:21:55.760
on that page and find it.

00:21:55.760 --> 00:22:04.090
Having a transcript is useful
in dozens of ways that may

00:22:04.090 --> 00:22:09.290
or may not be directly related to
an accommodation for a disability,

00:22:09.290 --> 00:22:12.860
but there are many ways that
that is a valuable thing to do,

00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:16.610
even though it costs-- they're not
that expensive but it costs like $50

00:22:16.610 --> 00:22:20.080
or something to go get
that podcast transcribed.

00:22:21.100 --> 00:22:25.290
We then have that content or
that searchability forever.

00:22:25.290 --> 00:22:29.480
I found that that's been
a really useful offshoot.

00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:30.640
<v Colleen> For sure.

00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:31.340
Me too.

00:22:31.340 --> 00:22:31.980
Yes.

00:22:31.980 --> 00:22:37.200
I've also had people that don't
have any particular disability

00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:40.050
with hearing or vision that
they've actually said to me

00:22:40.050 --> 00:22:41.890
about my own podcast,
that they appreciate

00:22:41.890 --> 00:22:47.060
that I put the transcript there
because it helps them find stuff

00:22:47.060 --> 00:22:48.060
like you said.

00:22:49.950 --> 00:22:52.960
When I do the transcript,
it reads more like an article,

00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:55.930
like a blog post because
some things are taken out.

00:22:55.930 --> 00:23:00.830
It's more reader-friendly for
somebody who is just reading it,

00:23:00.830 --> 00:23:02.850
and not just listening to it.

00:23:02.850 --> 00:23:05.510
It does help and people have
told me they appreciate that.

00:23:05.510 --> 00:23:11.760
Yes, it does totally help with
search engine optimization, for sure.

00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:14.160
ROB: It's just
more good content too.

00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:18.910
Sometimes I'll get links to,
let's say a New York Times podcast

00:23:18.910 --> 00:23:21.910
that I don't listen to
regularly, but somebody says,

00:23:21.910 --> 00:23:24.570
"Oh, this was a great one,
you should check it out."

00:23:24.570 --> 00:23:27.810
It's like, you know what,
I may just read seven paragraphs

00:23:27.810 --> 00:23:31.440
of that transcript and not spend
the hour finding that thing

00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:32.960
and listening to it,
downloading, and everything.

00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:40.650
There's so many ways
that that [clears throat]

00:23:40.650 --> 00:23:46.870
creates a positive outcome that
is adjacent to accessibility

00:23:46.870 --> 00:23:49.773
and the ADA, but you're not
necessarily making that decision

00:23:49.774 --> 00:23:51.740
solely for that reason.

00:23:52.390 --> 00:23:56.250
One thing I would add
about the lawsuit angle is

00:23:56.250 --> 00:23:58.770
that I think we've really
been done a disservice

00:23:58.770 --> 00:24:00.490
by what's called patent trolling.

00:24:00.490 --> 00:24:02.560
I don't know if you've
ever seen these letters,

00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:06.150
but I had a client years
ago who got a letter.

00:24:06.150 --> 00:24:09.820
The person who sent me a
letter basically claimed

00:24:09.820 --> 00:24:15.470
that they owned the patent to
the concept of a drop-down menu.

00:24:15.470 --> 00:24:17.800
They had this really
elaborate patent from the '90s

00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:20.350
that somebody bought
and sold 20 times.

00:24:20.350 --> 00:24:24.290
Now they were claiming, and this
was a nationally known hotel chain.

00:24:24.290 --> 00:24:27.580
They were basically
saying, pay us a settlement

00:24:27.580 --> 00:24:29.570
because your website
uses drop-down menus.

00:24:29.570 --> 00:24:30.000
<v Colleen> Wow.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:31.390
ROB: This is the thing.

00:24:31.390 --> 00:24:33.210
Most people would look at
that and roll their eyes.

00:24:34.610 --> 00:24:39.840
However, now that we actually
have a legal framework

00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:43.403
around the Americans with
Disabilities Act applying

00:24:43.404 --> 00:24:44.590
to websites.

00:24:44.590 --> 00:24:48.700
I think that that context where
like, oh, I remember five years ago,

00:24:48.700 --> 00:24:51.450
I got this BS letter from somebody.

00:24:51.450 --> 00:24:58.920
That actually really hurts the
ability for us to push people

00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:03.730
on accessibility in the
future because they conflate

00:25:03.730 --> 00:25:06.600
the obviously frivolous
patent lawsuit

00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:10.310
with the not obviously
frivolous accessibility lawsuit.

00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:13.270
Chris, you mentioned finding
somebody who has been harmed.

00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:18.410
The legal standard is you
actually have to have a plaintiff

00:25:18.410 --> 00:25:23.740
who has standing and has been unable
to do something on your website

00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:25.870
in order to file a lawsuit.

00:25:25.870 --> 00:25:31.260
I would actually argue that
that's pretty easy to find for 95%

00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:32.400
of these situations.

00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:36.530
Obviously, the famous case is
somebody who tried to order a pizza

00:25:36.530 --> 00:25:38.740
from the Domino's website,
who was unable to do that.

00:25:39.870 --> 00:25:41.830
I've talked to
clients who were like,

00:25:41.830 --> 00:25:44.800
"Well, only one person has
ever complained about this."

00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:47.750
I'm like, "Well, guess how many
plaintiffs you need for a lawsuit?

00:25:47.750 --> 00:25:48.890
You need one.

00:25:48.890 --> 00:25:52.550
This doesn't have to
be a massive problem."

00:25:52.550 --> 00:25:55.240
<v Chris> You just need one
person with the motivation

00:25:55.240 --> 00:26:00.270
and the resources and the
backing to go after you.

00:26:00.270 --> 00:26:03.700
ROB: They may not even be
seeking a huge amount of money.

00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:09.800
They may just be seeking a
remediation to the problem.

00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:17.610
I think that taking the legal
route gets an unnecessarily bad rap

00:26:17.610 --> 00:26:18.660
in our heads.

00:26:18.660 --> 00:26:21.720
I certainly know of people
who will just [inaudible]

00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:24.560
be like, "Oh, it's just a
bunch of lawyers getting paid,"

00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:31.010
and blah, blah,
but we live in a place in time and

00:26:31.010 --> 00:26:34.770
in the world where you are
required to follow the law,

00:26:34.770 --> 00:26:37.950
and the law is built to help
people, ideally.

00:26:39.490 --> 00:26:42.290
You can argue on the margins like,
well, this law shouldn't exist,

00:26:42.290 --> 00:26:43.970
or this law should be slightly
different, or it's not

00:26:43.970 --> 00:26:45.160
being interpreted correctly.

00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:48.430
I don't think this is one of those
situations, I think it's clear

00:26:48.430 --> 00:26:51.960
that you should have a wheelchair
ramp, and your website should be able

00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:55.060
to be used by the
maximum number of people.

00:26:56.715 --> 00:26:59.580
<v Chris> The question
that I can always go back

00:26:59.580 --> 00:27:03.560
to is asking the business owner,
it seems like an absurd question,

00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:06.410
but it usually elicits the right
responses, "Would you put a door knob

00:27:06.410 --> 00:27:07.610
on the front door
of your business?"

00:27:08.614 --> 00:27:09.294
ROB: Yes.

00:27:09.294 --> 00:27:11.196
[chuckles]

00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:15.880
<v Chris> Enough said.

00:27:15.880 --> 00:27:18.780
No one's going to say no to
that, so why are you going

00:27:18.780 --> 00:27:23.770
to make it hard for someone
to get in the front door

00:27:23.770 --> 00:27:25.920
of your business from your
website, where arguably

00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:28.150
the digital storefront is
the more important storefront

00:27:28.150 --> 00:27:32.100
for most businesses these days?

00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:36.540
It's baffling to me when someone
pushes back after that question,

00:27:36.540 --> 00:27:39.210
at that point, maybe someone
burned them at one point,

00:27:39.210 --> 00:27:43.350
I'm not sure, or there's some
other underlying objection there

00:27:43.350 --> 00:27:45.260
that I don't want to touch.

00:27:45.260 --> 00:27:49.440
Rob, you mentioned just
outright offensive beliefs,

00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:53.550
but the door knob question
usually gets them.

00:27:53.550 --> 00:27:54.630
<v Colleen> That's a good analogy.

00:27:54.630 --> 00:27:55.360
I like that.

00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:56.380
I have to use that.

00:27:56.380 --> 00:27:57.380
[laughs]

00:27:58.577 --> 00:28:03.750
ROB: That leads into another
question about just framing

00:28:03.750 --> 00:28:08.200
and phrasing things for people and
helping people who are doing design

00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:13.000
or doing marketing understand
what are our limitations

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:16.110
and why do they exist,
or what might we have to rethink?

00:28:16.110 --> 00:28:20.820
One of the things that we see
a lot is, we see designers

00:28:20.820 --> 00:28:25.120
who want to have the most
modern, edgy, cool,

00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:27.540
cutting-edge website imaginable.

00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:33.060
They often will create stuff in
Figma or whatever other design

00:28:33.060 --> 00:28:36.540
and prototyping tools they're
using, that either are

00:28:36.540 --> 00:28:42.700
just unquestionably impossible
to do excessively, or are going

00:28:42.700 --> 00:28:48.240
to be way more expensive to
do with accessibility in mind.

00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:52.260
How do you talk to a designer
or a client who's like,

00:28:52.260 --> 00:28:55.380
"I love this idea, look at how
this thing scrolls up and down,

00:28:55.380 --> 00:28:57.970
and you've got this thing floating
over here," and it's like,

00:28:57.970 --> 00:29:02.210
"Okay, slow down, this may look
cool, but we also need

00:29:02.210 --> 00:29:04.860
to think about everybody
who might be using this."

00:29:04.860 --> 00:29:06.840
Colleen, do you ever have
that experience where you have

00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:12.810
to burst someone's bubble
on a really fancy design?

00:29:12.810 --> 00:29:14.180
<v Colleen> Yes.

00:29:14.180 --> 00:29:18.150
I have had that happen but because
I've been in the design industry

00:29:18.150 --> 00:29:22.000
for 25 years, I don't feel
like it's me against them.

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:26.240
I don't feel like they think that
because I always approach it with,

00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:29.870
"Look, I want to keep your design
intact as much as possible,

00:29:29.870 --> 00:29:33.630
but at the same time, here's why
this is going to be a problem."

00:29:33.631 --> 00:29:34.291
[chuckles]

00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:40.070
If I have to,
I could even do a demonstration

00:29:40.070 --> 00:29:42.260
if it's something I can
do a demonstration for.

00:29:45.330 --> 00:29:47.950
Show them something with
Funkify or NoCoffee,

00:29:47.950 --> 00:29:51.010
one of those visual
disabilities simulators,

00:29:51.011 --> 00:29:53.050
just to help them understand.

00:29:53.050 --> 00:29:56.920
I also tell them, "Look,
it's not just about accessibility,

00:29:56.920 --> 00:29:59.100
it's about a good user
experience, and we don't want

00:29:59.100 --> 00:30:01.950
to make people think because if
you have to make people think

00:30:01.950 --> 00:30:07.590
and they have to-- you need to
have a guide to use your website,

00:30:07.590 --> 00:30:09.970
that's a design fail.

00:30:09.970 --> 00:30:13.050
I think the fact that I have
the design background helps,

00:30:13.050 --> 00:30:19.830
but I also approach
it very objectively.

00:30:19.830 --> 00:30:21.200
It's not my opinion.

00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:23.710
It's like,
this is why this is a problem too.

00:30:24.623 --> 00:30:29.570
ROB: Has anyone ever asked or
demanded, for lack of a better word,

00:30:29.570 --> 00:30:31.590
to do something
against your advice?

00:30:31.590 --> 00:30:32.880
If so, you handled that?

00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:34.080
<v Colleen> Yes.

00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:35.530
I forget what it was.

00:30:35.530 --> 00:30:38.900
It was a long time ago, and luckily
it's only been once or twice.

00:30:39.940 --> 00:30:43.360
I will tell them that if you're
going to go against my advice,

00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:44.930
you're going to have
to sign something.

00:30:44.930 --> 00:30:47.130
I'm putting it in writing and you're
going to have to sign something

00:30:47.130 --> 00:30:49.104
because I'm not going to
be responsible for this

00:30:49.105 --> 00:30:50.742
because I want them
to take it seriously

00:30:50.743 --> 00:30:52.180
and understand, look, I'm not going

00:30:52.180 --> 00:30:55.950
to put myself at some legal risk
because you're not listening.

00:30:55.950 --> 00:30:58.610
Yes, I will absolutely do that.

00:30:59.324 --> 00:31:00.250
ROB: I think that's also-

00:31:00.250 --> 00:31:04.960
<v Chris> Just sign of a paper
generally gets them to turn,

00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:06.030
do an about-face.

00:31:06.030 --> 00:31:07.650
We do the same thing.

00:31:07.650 --> 00:31:10.800
ROB: I have had people
sign it though and be like--

00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:13.700
and that actually brings
up another question

00:31:13.700 --> 00:31:16.210
and these two things are
going to weave together.

00:31:16.210 --> 00:31:18.490
I had them in my head
as two different topics,

00:31:18.490 --> 00:31:19.860
but let's weave them together.

00:31:19.860 --> 00:31:26.900
I want to talk about this question
of-- I think the typical web design

00:31:26.900 --> 00:31:32.880
and development contract is already
going to include some warranty

00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:34.660
and liability statements.

00:31:34.660 --> 00:31:39.640
Basically, since the beginning of
time when I was building websites,

00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:43.730
I had a boilerplate contract
and it said something like,

00:31:43.730 --> 00:31:47.630
there's no warranty
for any specific use.

00:31:47.630 --> 00:31:51.400
Basically,
you can't sue me for not being happy

00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:54.000
with this website after
you accept the results.

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:56.047
We have people sign
what is essentially

00:31:56.048 --> 00:31:57.480
an approval agreement like,

00:31:57.480 --> 00:32:03.140
you did what we said we were going
to do, and the project is done.

00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:10.850
There's definitely already some
framework for the web designer

00:32:10.850 --> 00:32:14.833
or developer not getting
sued directly for a site

00:32:14.833 --> 00:32:15.750
that's not accessible.

00:32:15.750 --> 00:32:19.210
Ultimately, that is going to
be on the owner of the business

00:32:19.210 --> 00:32:22.460
who is presenting that
website to the world.

00:32:22.460 --> 00:32:26.100
<v Colleen> It has happened
that a developer has been sued.

00:32:26.678 --> 00:32:29.330
ROB: Tell me about that
story in more detail, Colleen,

00:32:29.330 --> 00:32:30.280
if you know the--

00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:33.580
<v Colleen> I think it was the Wet
Willie's Bar chain or something.

00:32:33.580 --> 00:32:34.440
I think it was them.

00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:39.110
I think that the plaintiff
brought a claim against them

00:32:39.110 --> 00:32:41.560
and the web developer
and maybe even the host.

00:32:42.790 --> 00:32:45.570
ROB: Like putting more
defendants on the list, basically?

00:32:45.570 --> 00:32:46.700
<v Colleen> Yes.

00:32:46.700 --> 00:32:49.490
I don't remember that much about it,
but I read about it a long time ago.

00:32:50.437 --> 00:32:53.130
ROB: I'd be curious what the
outcome of that would be like.

00:32:53.130 --> 00:32:56.140
I think a good lawyer could
probably get that defendant,

00:32:56.140 --> 00:32:58.710
especially the host,
the host is clearly not responsible

00:32:58.710 --> 00:33:00.340
for something that you
put on the internet.

00:33:00.340 --> 00:33:02.420
<v Colleen> Then there's
the cost to defend yourself.

00:33:02.420 --> 00:33:04.200
ROB: Exactly.

00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:07.730
It's not the thing where you
would get legal fees reimbursed.

00:33:07.730 --> 00:33:10.021
You got to show up and
defend yourself, right?

00:33:10.021 --> 00:33:11.070
<v Colleen> Right.

00:33:11.070 --> 00:33:13.540
ROB: Obviously,
you can't ever totally prevent that

00:33:13.540 --> 00:33:19.850
but I think having clear language
in your contract is becoming more

00:33:19.850 --> 00:33:20.790
and more important.

00:33:20.790 --> 00:33:24.990
I'm sure you guys could both
talk a bit about where you are

00:33:24.990 --> 00:33:28.250
with your contracts and
language around that.

00:33:28.250 --> 00:33:32.860
One of the things that
we are working on at HDC

00:33:32.860 --> 00:33:39.070
is actually putting language in
the contract that shifts the power

00:33:39.070 --> 00:33:40.380
in that decision.

00:33:40.380 --> 00:33:42.560
You talked about, okay,
a client really wants

00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:45.100
to do this thing,
they're going to have

00:33:45.100 --> 00:33:49.720
to sign an against my advice
document of some kind.

00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:51.660
One of the things that
we're experimenting

00:33:51.660 --> 00:33:59.870
with is actually having the contract
say if you the client present

00:33:59.870 --> 00:34:07.740
to us a request or a design that we
believe would violate the Americans

00:34:07.740 --> 00:34:10.880
with Disabilities Act,
we are just going to change it

00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:13.690
whether you like it or not,
and obviously, there's some gray area

00:34:13.690 --> 00:34:13.950
in there.

00:34:13.950 --> 00:34:16.350
That's something that
we're experimenting with,

00:34:16.350 --> 00:34:23.210
and I think we're like the
architect analogy comes in.

00:34:23.210 --> 00:34:26.640
Obviously, you would expect
an architect to refuse

00:34:26.640 --> 00:34:32.260
to design something that doesn't
even come close to being up to code.

00:34:32.260 --> 00:34:36.470
We want to get to a place where
as developers and designers,

00:34:36.470 --> 00:34:39.350
we're essentially going to refuse
to build something that's not up

00:34:39.350 --> 00:34:41.260
to code in the sense of the ADA.

00:34:43.290 --> 00:34:47.240
Chris, I'm curious how you phrase
things from a contract standpoint

00:34:47.240 --> 00:34:51.100
to protect yourself, but also to
set the right expectations upfront

00:34:51.100 --> 00:34:51.650
with clients.

00:34:51.650 --> 00:34:53.766
<v Chris> From a
liability perspective,

00:34:53.767 --> 00:34:56.510
there are a couple of things
that we do.

00:34:56.510 --> 00:34:59.400
One is just working
with your attorney.

00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:02.040
Having an attorney write
an actual contract for you.

00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:05.260
Making sure that they have a
solid indemnification clause

00:35:05.260 --> 00:35:08.740
in your contract for after
delivery, basically,

00:35:08.740 --> 00:35:14.140
meaning you can't be pulled into
lawsuits for X, Y, and Z reasons.

00:35:14.140 --> 00:35:19.780
One of them for us is client content
or client use of the deliverables.

00:35:19.780 --> 00:35:22.623
Those are two things in
our indemnification clause

00:35:22.624 --> 00:35:26.020
because we want to make sure, hey,
if you go in and you change a bunch

00:35:26.020 --> 00:35:29.540
of stuff on your website
because once you hand a--

00:35:29.540 --> 00:35:33.080
I'm rambling a little, but once
you hand a website off to a client,

00:35:33.080 --> 00:35:35.400
all bets are off unless
they're on a maintenance plan

00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:37.170
and you're handling
all the changes.

00:35:37.170 --> 00:35:39.010
You have to make sure
that you're protected

00:35:39.010 --> 00:35:41.790
if you don't force your
clients into a maintenance plan

00:35:41.790 --> 00:35:45.200
where your team and the people
you trust retain complete control

00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:46.200
of the website.

00:35:47.450 --> 00:35:50.090
Even beyond that,
the other thing in our guarantee

00:35:50.090 --> 00:35:53.110
is we only will guarantee
the accessibility of things

00:35:53.110 --> 00:35:55.860
that we have a direct
hand in creating.

00:35:55.860 --> 00:36:00.090
Whether that's the theme or aspects
of a design or custom blocks

00:36:00.090 --> 00:36:03.960
in Gutenberg or content that's
been manually inserted into a page.

00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:08.070
Anything that's imported,
anything that's either legacy code

00:36:08.070 --> 00:36:12.200
or third-party code where
there's a known issue with it,

00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:15.720
all of those things are excluded
from our accessibility guarantee

00:36:15.720 --> 00:36:18.750
because we can't
control those things.

00:36:18.750 --> 00:36:23.400
Only guarantee what you can control
and make sure that you have an out

00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:26.570
if you're handing websites off
and not maintaining them yourself.

00:36:26.570 --> 00:36:29.000
Those would be my two
big pieces of advice.

00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:31.080
ROB: We also have
something in our contract

00:36:31.080 --> 00:36:36.420
that limits our damages to the
amount paid and stuff like that.

00:36:36.420 --> 00:36:39.970
You're not getting into a
position where you could be sued

00:36:39.970 --> 00:36:42.570
for more than the value of the
project or anything like that.

00:36:42.570 --> 00:36:45.970
Obviously, even that would
be a very extreme situation.

00:36:45.970 --> 00:36:47.170
Colleen, what about you?

00:36:47.170 --> 00:36:52.040
How do you phrase this in
legal terms for clients?

00:36:52.040 --> 00:36:56.970
<v Colleen> I do similar to what
Chris does, but what you were saying

00:36:56.970 --> 00:37:01.686
about guaranteeing
accessibility, yes,

00:37:01.686 --> 00:37:03.070
I wouldn't guarantee accessibility

00:37:03.070 --> 00:37:05.750
if the client is--
they're updating the site

00:37:05.750 --> 00:37:09.100
or they have somebody else that
is doing the technical updates

00:37:09.100 --> 00:37:10.730
or anything like that.

00:37:10.730 --> 00:37:13.180
I also tell them though about their
documents because a lot of times,

00:37:13.180 --> 00:37:17.470
documents can get
overlooked and so they need

00:37:17.470 --> 00:37:20.760
to have those made
accessible as well.

00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:21.850
I do bring that up.

00:37:21.850 --> 00:37:26.520
I actually limit my liability
to 50% of the project fee

00:37:26.520 --> 00:37:29.420
because they're responsible
for approving certain things.

00:37:29.420 --> 00:37:32.580
Obviously, they're hiring
me for certain expertise,

00:37:32.580 --> 00:37:37.140
but they are also required to review
certain things and take ownership

00:37:37.140 --> 00:37:37.990
of that.

00:37:37.990 --> 00:37:40.570
I limit it to half
of the project fee.

00:37:42.830 --> 00:37:45.130
Yes, very similar
to what Chris said.

00:37:45.697 --> 00:37:47.770
ROB: I think one
thing I hear from both

00:37:47.770 --> 00:37:50.520
of you is this is
really a group effort

00:37:50.520 --> 00:37:55.620
and thus it's simultaneously
very difficult and, in some ways,

00:37:55.620 --> 00:37:59.370
risky to everyone
involved in the sense

00:37:59.370 --> 00:38:03.320
that like you could deliver
something that is fantastic

00:38:03.320 --> 00:38:05.360
and effectively perfect.

00:38:05.360 --> 00:38:08.890
In the moment, the person who's
writing the blog posts over

00:38:08.890 --> 00:38:12.300
at the client company gets their
hands on it, all of a sudden,

00:38:12.300 --> 00:38:13.180
where the all tag?

00:38:13.180 --> 00:38:15.660
All of a sudden, the headings
are out of order and you start

00:38:15.660 --> 00:38:20.050
to go down this rabbit
hole of inaccessibility.

00:38:20.050 --> 00:38:26.900
I think without talking too much
about the page builder problem,

00:38:26.900 --> 00:38:31.350
I also think that giving your
client the ability to do everything

00:38:31.350 --> 00:38:34.660
but the kitchen sink on those
pages essentially guarantees

00:38:34.660 --> 00:38:36.460
that somebody's going to break
something and it's not going

00:38:36.460 --> 00:38:39.050
to be accessible three months or
six months from now in the way

00:38:39.050 --> 00:38:41.930
that it was when
you handed it over.

00:38:41.930 --> 00:38:47.250
A website is always going
to be a collaboration

00:38:48.490 --> 00:38:52.380
between independent contractors,
employees, business owners,

00:38:52.380 --> 00:38:55.740
designers, developers,
writers, interns, et cetera.

00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:03.810
Ultimately, the buck stops with
the person who owns the business

00:39:03.810 --> 00:39:08.090
to train everyone to understand
and care about this, but also,

00:39:08.090 --> 00:39:09.420
it's a lot of work.

00:39:09.420 --> 00:39:12.030
It's work that they may
not have been expecting.

00:39:12.030 --> 00:39:18.780
It's stuff you have to learn and
I think there definitely could be

00:39:18.780 --> 00:39:24.260
a preconception of like, oh, well
the internet's just easy and basic.

00:39:24.260 --> 00:39:27.570
I'm basically just typing stuff in
and I don't have to think about it.

00:39:29.300 --> 00:39:35.810
Obviously, that's changing as the
internet is getting more advanced.

00:39:35.810 --> 00:39:39.870
We have more regulation via the
ADA now and stuff like that.

00:39:39.870 --> 00:39:45.590
In the same vein as the privacy
laws, the application of the ADA law

00:39:45.590 --> 00:39:49.830
to websites requires
everyone to learn more.

00:39:49.830 --> 00:39:53.810
I think that can be sometimes a
frustrating experience for people

00:39:53.810 --> 00:39:58.280
because having more requirements
and being required to do more

00:39:58.280 --> 00:40:02.090
and know more inherently
increases costs to some degree.

00:40:03.260 --> 00:40:11.290
One question that I saw in the
comments is what about the idea that

00:40:11.290 --> 00:40:16.740
if a client has major accessibility
problems on their site,

00:40:16.740 --> 00:40:20.184
that to some degree,
it'll impact their reputation.

00:40:20.184 --> 00:40:20.600
Right?

00:40:20.600 --> 00:40:22.060
<v Colleen> Oh yes.

00:40:22.060 --> 00:40:23.930
ROB: Do you ever talk
with clients about that,

00:40:23.930 --> 00:40:25.590
and how do you frame that?

00:40:25.590 --> 00:40:26.190
<v Colleen> Yes.

00:40:26.190 --> 00:40:30.094
I preach this to clients, I preach
it to designers that I train

00:40:30.094 --> 00:40:31.140
in accessibility.

00:40:32.140 --> 00:40:37.140
Definitely with reputation because
it's not just-- when you think

00:40:37.140 --> 00:40:39.340
about branding,
branding is reputation.

00:40:39.340 --> 00:40:43.030
It's not just visual branding,
it's also their messaging.

00:40:43.030 --> 00:40:46.519
Also, is accessibility,
is inclusiveness important

00:40:46.520 --> 00:40:47.750
to this business?

00:40:47.750 --> 00:40:51.080
71% of people with a
disability that go to a website

00:40:51.080 --> 00:40:53.410
that is not accessible
will leave that website.

00:40:53.410 --> 00:40:57.680
I think that was the Click-Away
Pound study or something.

00:40:58.790 --> 00:41:01.570
What happens is we have
Google reviews, we have Yelp,

00:41:01.570 --> 00:41:05.660
we have all kinds of review
sites, Facebook pages

00:41:05.660 --> 00:41:06.950
where you can leave reviews.

00:41:06.950 --> 00:41:10.510
People talk usually when
they don't like something.

00:41:10.510 --> 00:41:15.020
Definitely, that's going to affect
a brand's reputation in a positive

00:41:15.020 --> 00:41:18.060
or a negative manner if their
site is accessible or not

00:41:18.060 --> 00:41:20.970
and that's going to then
affect the bottom line.

00:41:21.646 --> 00:41:24.210
<v Chris> Just to piggyback on
that, few things are sadder

00:41:24.210 --> 00:41:27.240
than a brand that makes
all of these [inaudible]

00:41:27.240 --> 00:41:31.550
about diversity, equity, inclusion,
and having strong mission statements

00:41:31.550 --> 00:41:32.400
around diversity.

00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:35.210
Then you go to their website
and it's a dumpster fire

00:41:35.210 --> 00:41:36.580
in terms of accessibility.

00:41:36.580 --> 00:41:37.020
Right?

00:41:37.020 --> 00:41:37.880
<v Colleen> Right.

00:41:37.880 --> 00:41:40.000
<v Chris> That's something that
you can point out and you have

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:42.590
to have good rapport with the
customer in order to be able

00:41:42.590 --> 00:41:44.580
to point that out in
a sales conversation.

00:41:44.580 --> 00:41:46.550
Otherwise, they may just get
offended and shut you down

00:41:46.550 --> 00:41:48.990
but if you had a few conversations
with them being like,

00:41:48.990 --> 00:41:51.510
"Look, you're not living up
to your own stated goals."

00:41:51.510 --> 00:41:55.080
Another favorite of mine is just
looking at their competitors.

00:41:55.080 --> 00:41:58.140
If there are a couple of
competitors that you can track down

00:41:58.140 --> 00:42:01.770
to your customer or your potential
customer that are already accessible

00:42:01.770 --> 00:42:04.150
or are doing good things
in terms of accessibility

00:42:04.150 --> 00:42:07.290
and turning around and saying, hey,
so and so's already doing this.

00:42:07.290 --> 00:42:08.110
<v Colleen> I'll just tell them.

00:42:08.110 --> 00:42:10.370
I'll just rip the bandaid
off and I'll just tell them.

00:42:10.370 --> 00:42:11.730
I don't have [inaudible]

00:42:11.730 --> 00:42:14.050
conversations
beforehand [inaudible]

00:42:14.050 --> 00:42:18.200
ROB: I love the idea of a wealthy
business owner getting offended

00:42:18.200 --> 00:42:22.550
when being called out for not
achieving or even attempting

00:42:22.550 --> 00:42:25.420
to achieve their own
DEI goals like that.

00:42:26.670 --> 00:42:29.030
That person taking
offense to that is

00:42:29.030 --> 00:42:32.170
the most hilarious upside-down
scenario I could possibly imagine,

00:42:33.340 --> 00:42:36.440
but we do know that that
happens all the time.

00:42:36.440 --> 00:42:43.930
Chris, I'm curious what you think
about there is a potential bill going

00:42:43.930 --> 00:42:46.610
through Congress called the
Websites and Software Applications

00:42:46.610 --> 00:42:47.510
Accessibility Act.

00:42:47.510 --> 00:42:49.060
Have you dug into that at all?

00:42:49.060 --> 00:42:51.500
If so, can you tell us about it
and how you think that's going

00:42:51.500 --> 00:42:54.060
to shape the future
of this conversation?

00:42:54.439 --> 00:42:57.020
<v Chris> I actually have
not dug into that bill,

00:42:57.020 --> 00:42:58.970
I'm a little embarrassed to say.

00:42:58.970 --> 00:43:01.330
ROB: Neither have I and that's
why I put the question to you,

00:43:01.330 --> 00:43:02.110
so there we go.

00:43:02.110 --> 00:43:03.890
We'll come back to that question.

00:43:04.646 --> 00:43:06.860
<v Chris> Do you have any
high-level impressions?

00:43:06.860 --> 00:43:11.170
Is it one of those where they're
trying to limit business liability

00:43:11.170 --> 00:43:13.080
in terms of accessibility
or is it the opposite?

00:43:13.595 --> 00:43:15.850
ROB: I'm going to Google it
while we answer the next question

00:43:15.850 --> 00:43:18.070
and then we're going to come back
and we're going to talk about that.

00:43:18.070 --> 00:43:20.200
<v Chris> Okay, sounds good.

00:43:20.200 --> 00:43:22.180
ROB: These are
coming from the chat.

00:43:23.560 --> 00:43:27.870
How often do you get to train
clients after you've given the keys

00:43:27.870 --> 00:43:29.060
to their new accessible website?

00:43:29.060 --> 00:43:33.270
I think this is like a parallel
to is this person just going

00:43:33.270 --> 00:43:35.940
to take this website and
mess it up and it's going

00:43:35.940 --> 00:43:37.700
to be a dumpster
fire in six months?

00:43:38.930 --> 00:43:42.660
Colleen, how do you handle,
for example, content training

00:43:42.660 --> 00:43:45.440
because obviously you have quite a
bit of control, you have quite a bit

00:43:45.440 --> 00:43:50.740
of ability to mess things up for
lack of a better way of putting it.

00:43:50.740 --> 00:43:52.780
How do you handle training a
client and making sure that

00:43:52.780 --> 00:43:57.450
that training is actually
sustained and useful and applied?

00:43:57.450 --> 00:44:00.490
<v Colleen> What I do is I'll
create a guide that has to do

00:44:00.490 --> 00:44:04.850
with how to update their
content excessively, like images

00:44:04.850 --> 00:44:07.680
and text headings, audio and video.

00:44:07.680 --> 00:44:11.290
I'll give them a guide which has
hyperlinks to various services

00:44:11.290 --> 00:44:14.010
for captioning or
transcripts, things like that.

00:44:14.010 --> 00:44:17.620
I also will do a live video
call with them to show them

00:44:17.620 --> 00:44:20.910
around the site as well
but since a lot of people,

00:44:20.910 --> 00:44:23.150
they get excited about the
guide and then they never look

00:44:23.150 --> 00:44:24.670
at it again.

00:44:24.670 --> 00:44:29.200
One thing that we've done very
successfully and this is also

00:44:29.200 --> 00:44:33.730
to help them maintain the
accessibility without having

00:44:33.730 --> 00:44:36.430
to think too much about
it is we do a lot of work

00:44:36.430 --> 00:44:39.600
with advanced custom fields to
prevent them from being able

00:44:39.600 --> 00:44:42.050
to get into certain things
and formatting them some way

00:44:42.050 --> 00:44:43.140
that we don't want them to.

00:44:44.370 --> 00:44:49.360
We'll put little instructions,
like notes above the fields

00:44:49.360 --> 00:44:57.000
so they can see, enter this and
only enter this or upload this file

00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:58.070
or whatever it is.

00:44:58.070 --> 00:45:02.490
We'll put in some short instructions
where needed so it's right there

00:45:02.490 --> 00:45:04.600
in their face and they don't
have to go find their guide

00:45:04.600 --> 00:45:07.650
and then figure out,
what am I supposed to do here?

00:45:07.650 --> 00:45:11.230
Then the guide also will have
screenshots to things as well.

00:45:11.230 --> 00:45:13.850
It's kind of a user
manual for their website

00:45:13.850 --> 00:45:16.260
that also incorporates
accessibility practices.

00:45:16.871 --> 00:45:19.200
ROB: It feels to me like
the more you document it,

00:45:19.200 --> 00:45:22.540
the more them ignoring it looks bad
for them and looks good for you.

00:45:22.540 --> 00:45:25.430
In that scenario where somebody
comes back and is like,

00:45:25.430 --> 00:45:26.170
"What happened here?

00:45:26.170 --> 00:45:29.290
Why are we getting this letter
six months later?" It's like,

00:45:29.290 --> 00:45:32.770
"Well, do you remember this
extensive training that I gave you

00:45:32.770 --> 00:45:33.540
that you ignored?

00:45:33.540 --> 00:45:36.120
Well, this is the
consequence of that."

00:45:37.420 --> 00:45:42.450
I think that while it is always
extra work and extra expense,

00:45:42.450 --> 00:45:46.700
being more thorough seems
like the way to go with this.

00:45:46.700 --> 00:45:50.470
<v Chris> It was actually at least
in part out of the frustration

00:45:50.470 --> 00:45:53.800
of handing off websites that we
knew were perfectly accessible

00:45:53.800 --> 00:45:56.800
and watched them get
systematically ruined,

00:45:56.800 --> 00:46:00.070
that we built accessibility
checker because we wanted

00:46:00.070 --> 00:46:03.740
to have something that was
directly in the edit screen

00:46:03.740 --> 00:46:05.310
to get people direct feedback.

00:46:05.310 --> 00:46:09.060
That's been an evolving thing
because not all customers use it,

00:46:09.060 --> 00:46:11.710
so we're still trying to figure
out ways to make that useful

00:46:11.710 --> 00:46:14.970
and to get more customers
to engage with that tool

00:46:14.970 --> 00:46:19.270
and help keep content accessible
as they're entering it.

00:46:19.270 --> 00:46:23.610
I think that for us and
that I think by virtue

00:46:23.610 --> 00:46:26.210
of Colleen's documentation
like having tool tips

00:46:26.210 --> 00:46:30.030
and messages directly in the
ACF, editing areas,

00:46:30.030 --> 00:46:33.050
it's those sorts of preventive
steps that are going

00:46:33.050 --> 00:46:37.640
to ultimately get us to a better
place and actually going out

00:46:37.640 --> 00:46:41.370
and anticipating the customer's
going to create problems.

00:46:41.370 --> 00:46:45.420
I also think that care plans with
agencies have a bigger role to play

00:46:45.420 --> 00:46:48.430
in this than a lot of agency
owners might think right now.

00:46:48.430 --> 00:46:51.300
I think starting to
roll accessibility

00:46:51.300 --> 00:46:53.690
into your care plans
have a scanning solution

00:46:53.690 --> 00:46:56.680
that's either native WordPress
or external, whatever you like,

00:46:57.930 --> 00:47:02.360
and have a plan in place at
least for accessibility basics.

00:47:02.360 --> 00:47:05.750
You don't necessarily have
to have an auditor on staff

00:47:05.750 --> 00:47:09.400
but if you have a good scanning
solution that's not an overlay

00:47:09.400 --> 00:47:13.600
that can detect some basic
problems and flag those for you

00:47:13.600 --> 00:47:17.970
and for your customer, I think
that that is a good thing to add

00:47:17.970 --> 00:47:19.130
onto your care plans.

00:47:19.130 --> 00:47:21.620
It'll increase the value, you could
probably justify charging more.

00:47:22.440 --> 00:47:22.820
ROB: Sure.

00:47:22.820 --> 00:47:25.720
Plans are always a great source
of revenue for everyone too.

00:47:25.720 --> 00:47:29.520
If we can combine consistency
of revenue with improvements

00:47:29.520 --> 00:47:31.650
to the site,
I think that's always a win-win.

00:47:31.650 --> 00:47:33.650
We have about two minutes left.

00:47:33.650 --> 00:47:36.060
Colleen, why don't you finish that
last thought and then we'll dive

00:47:36.060 --> 00:47:36.790
into the closing questions.

00:47:36.790 --> 00:47:38.720
<v Colleen> Oh, I was just going
to say the accessibility check

00:47:38.720 --> 00:47:39.410
or plugin is great.

00:47:39.410 --> 00:47:42.930
I've seen some different ones and
I find that my clients find it

00:47:42.930 --> 00:47:45.280
much easier to understand
than some others.

00:47:45.280 --> 00:47:46.620
<v Chris> Oh, well, thank you.

00:47:46.621 --> 00:47:48.092
I appreciate that.

00:47:48.093 --> 00:47:48.980
ROB: Agreed.

00:47:48.980 --> 00:47:50.410
A sales pitch for
the accessibility.

00:47:50.410 --> 00:47:50.580
Sure.

00:47:50.580 --> 00:47:52.020
<v Chris> Did not [inaudible]

00:47:52.020 --> 00:47:52.570
I promise.

00:47:52.570 --> 00:47:53.060
I'm sorry.

00:47:53.060 --> 00:47:56.560
ROB: The law we
mentioned was introduced

00:47:56.560 --> 00:48:00.900
by Senator Tammy Duckworth
and one other representative.

00:48:00.900 --> 00:48:05.730
Basically, it would take the
court decisions around the ADA

00:48:05.730 --> 00:48:07.930
and clarify them at
the legislative level.

00:48:07.930 --> 00:48:09.650
We're not just relying on judges,

00:48:09.651 --> 00:48:11.840
we're actually saying
the ADA does apply

00:48:11.840 --> 00:48:14.630
to websites and it
sounds like they want

00:48:14.630 --> 00:48:17.460
to maybe apply some
actual standards.

00:48:17.460 --> 00:48:19.640
That's something we didn't
talk about but the question

00:48:19.640 --> 00:48:26.790
of is this WCAG2.1, AA,
AAA, A, 2.2, whatever?

00:48:26.790 --> 00:48:28.810
There's a lot of standards
and they're similar

00:48:28.810 --> 00:48:31.400
but there is some nuance
differences to them.

00:48:31.400 --> 00:48:31.907
It sounds like-

00:48:31.908 --> 00:48:33.190
<v Chris> Knowing
the US government,

00:48:33.190 --> 00:48:35.390
they're not going to rely on an
external standard, they're going

00:48:35.390 --> 00:48:37.190
to create their own that all of us-

00:48:37.190 --> 00:48:39.880
ROB: Then there's Section
508, there's all these things.

00:48:39.880 --> 00:48:43.660
It sounds like they want to
legislatively clarify that.

00:48:43.660 --> 00:48:48.450
I would say I'm operating
personally under the assumption that

00:48:48.450 --> 00:48:50.680
that is already how a
judge would interpret it,

00:48:50.680 --> 00:48:53.010
but it certainly does not
hurt for the legislature

00:48:53.010 --> 00:48:56.510
to also put that in writing.

00:48:56.510 --> 00:48:57.690
We have a minute left.

00:48:59.050 --> 00:49:02.660
What is the one thing that
you would ask a client

00:49:02.660 --> 00:49:06.670
to do tomorrow that would
take them less than an hour

00:49:06.670 --> 00:49:10.310
to go in and fix up
accessibility on their site?

00:49:10.310 --> 00:49:14.860
Colleen, do you have an easy fix,
or what is the number one easy fix

00:49:14.860 --> 00:49:16.430
that people don't do?

00:49:16.430 --> 00:49:17.790
<v Colleen> Here's one.

00:49:17.790 --> 00:49:22.450
I would say go slap an
accessibility statement on that site

00:49:22.450 --> 00:49:25.800
if you don't have it
because that is easy to do.

00:49:25.800 --> 00:49:29.310
You can just write something about
your commitment to accessibility

00:49:29.310 --> 00:49:31.310
and talk about what
efforts you're taking,

00:49:31.310 --> 00:49:35.450
there's also some accessibility
statement generators out there.

00:49:35.450 --> 00:49:38.320
A lot of people will overlook this.

00:49:38.320 --> 00:49:41.230
When I do website audits,
I often find that people are trying

00:49:41.230 --> 00:49:43.800
to make their website accessible,
but they're not putting

00:49:43.800 --> 00:49:45.870
the accessibility
statement on there.

00:49:45.870 --> 00:49:48.270
It's very important to do that.

00:49:48.270 --> 00:49:52.430
According to some lawyers,
that can prevent some legal issues

00:49:52.430 --> 00:49:56.830
and I look at it as a beware
of dog sign to a robber.

00:49:56.830 --> 00:49:59.240
They will see that sign and
maybe move on to the next house.

00:49:59.240 --> 00:50:02.130
They don't want to mess with that.

00:50:03.467 --> 00:50:04.660
ROB: Chris, what do you think?

00:50:04.660 --> 00:50:07.111
What's a simple fix that
people aren't doing,

00:50:07.112 --> 00:50:08.230
but should be doing?

00:50:09.154 --> 00:50:11.570
<v Chris> I don't know if I would be
able to tell this to my customers.

00:50:11.570 --> 00:50:13.060
I think you said,
reach out to one of your customers

00:50:13.060 --> 00:50:14.970
but I would say if
you have customers

00:50:14.970 --> 00:50:16.926
that are using
accessibility overlays,

00:50:16.927 --> 00:50:18.480
reach out to them and ask them

00:50:18.480 --> 00:50:22.410
to reconsider that relationship
and make a game plan in 2023

00:50:22.410 --> 00:50:26.030
to start introducing true
accessibility instead of a band-aid.

00:50:26.030 --> 00:50:27.200
ROB: Excellent.

00:50:27.200 --> 00:50:27.570
All right.

00:50:27.570 --> 00:50:28.159
Well, thank you-

00:50:28.159 --> 00:50:28.759
<v Colleen> [inaudible]

00:50:28.759 --> 00:50:29.520
ROB: Yes.

00:50:29.520 --> 00:50:30.260
Thank you so much.

00:50:30.260 --> 00:50:32.710
Chris and Colleen,
it's been really fun.

00:50:32.710 --> 00:50:36.620
We're going to wrap it up and
move on to our next session.

00:50:36.620 --> 00:50:38.470
It's been really fun
chatting with you guys.

00:50:38.470 --> 00:50:38.980
<v Colleen> Thanks so much.

00:50:38.980 --> 00:50:39.890
ROB: Thanks for joining me.

00:50:39.890 --> 00:50:40.760
<v Chris> Thanks, Rob.

00:50:42.725 --> 00:50:43.181
<v Colleen> Thank you.

00:50:43.182 --> 00:50:44.130
<v Amber> Thank you, everyone.

00:50:44.130 --> 00:50:48.840
Thank you, Rob, Colleen,
and Chris for this fabulous session

00:50:48.840 --> 00:50:54.370
on Selling Skeptical
Clients on Accessibility.

00:50:54.370 --> 00:50:56.560
You can continue the
conversation in the chat for

00:50:56.560 --> 00:50:57.600
about the next 10 minutes.

00:50:57.600 --> 00:51:00.180
Then we will refresh the
chats so it'll be set up

00:51:00.180 --> 00:51:02.290
for our next conversation.

00:51:04.080 --> 00:51:09.550
You can also tag us on social
media with the #WPA11YDay

00:51:09.550 --> 00:51:13.940
and #WP2022-- Oh, sorry.

00:51:13.940 --> 00:51:16.507
