00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.180
AMBER HINDS: Our next
video is from Sandy Feldman.

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.150
Sandy is a web designer.

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:41.870
She designs and codes
accessible and responsive sites

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:46.520
and custom word press themes and
is also a freelancer for CNIB.

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:52.350
Frontier digital accessibility
and inclusive media and design.

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.400
Helping developers understand
and fix accessibility problems.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:00.960
Today, Sandy will be talking
about how to choose a plug-in

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.430
for accessibility.

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.460
I don't believe that Sandy is
here but feel free to engage

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.880
with other attendees in the
idea's section of the chat

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.740
and we will be back in about
15 minutes with another video.

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:18.980
SANDY FELDMAN: My name is
Sandy Feldman and I'm gonna talk

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:22.070
about picking plug-ins
for accessibility.

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:26.740
And five things that you can do
to keep your site accessible.

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.180
Because plug-ins will break sites.

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:36.190
So, first thing is to
test your theme and uh,

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:41.700
before you install a plug-in
and pick your plug-in carefully,

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.760
test the theme again and
then I'm gonna talk a bit

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:50.270
about accessibility plug-ins and
the stop-gap solution you can use.

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.310
So, check your theme.

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.430
Make sure that everything can
be accessed with the keyboard

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.080
and use automated
accessibility testing tools.

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.050
Keyboard access,
first thing is you navigate

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:11.760
through the site using the tab key.

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.210
And the first thing you should come
across is the skipped content link

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:16.570
or skip navigation.

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:22.293
It's really important because
it's gonna let your keyboard users

00:02:22.294 --> 00:02:26.450
not have to tab through
the entire navigation.

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:34.000
Make sure that each Inter
app development gets focus

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.210
and that focus is always fist balled
and that it's in a logical order

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:41.940
which is usually left to
right, top to bottom.

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:48.450
And you can activate any interactive
elements using your space bar,

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.770
your enter key or your arrow key.

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.290
The testing tools, there's a lot
of them, a lot of different ones.

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.160
And none of them is perfect.

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:06.060
They all miss things and I'm
gonna talk about four tools

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:12.790
and show the differences between
what they catch and what they miss.

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.007
So, first one is
Wave, then SiteImprove

00:03:16.007 --> 00:03:18.699
and then Lighthouse and aXe.

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:24.770
So, Wave is a browser
extension that you can add.

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:29.600
It comes from wave.webaim.org.

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.660
You can go there as a page.

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:44.190
SiteImprove, so SiteImprove in this
situation caught a lot more errors.

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:54.200
Wave cost caught 88 contrast errors
and one error but 25 concerns

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:55.570
to check out.

00:03:55.570 --> 00:04:01.770
SiteImprove caught duplicate
element IDs, page regions

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:05.190
without accessible names,
headings were not structured

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:08.710
there's orphan contact and
it found the contrast errors

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:10.520
as well as font size errors.

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:17.320
Lighthouse says the
site is 97% accessible.

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:20.540
But it did catch the problems
with contrast and headings.

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:28.480
aXe came up with 184 problematic
elements and it goes into detail

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:31.140
in the app.

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:36.750
So, once you've tested the
site and you see what kind

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:39.820
of shape it's in,
pick your plug-in.

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:43.880
Every plug-in has got
information associated with it.

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:48.030
How many installs there are,
reviews, when it was last updated

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:51.710
and whether or not it's compatible
with your version of word press.

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:55.830
So, I have two
plug-ins on the screen.

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:57.690
The information about them.

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:04.140
One has 900 plus four
and a half star reviews.

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:10.250
The other was last updated
four days ago 5 million

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:14.040
plus active installations and
it's compatible with my version

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:15.590
of WordPress.

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:20.600
The other one has 20 active
installations, one five star review.

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:22.630
We can guess who wrote that.

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:28.930
Last update three years ago and
untested with a version of WordPress.

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:32.420
So, use the information
to pick which plug-in.

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:34.070
They both do the same thing.

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:41.330
And install that plug-in and activate
it and then a check the theme again.

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:44.850
Make sure that everything can
be accessed with the keyboard

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:48.770
and use your automated
tools to check out the site.

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:55.300
You do this for every plug-in you
install, right after it's installed.

00:05:55.300 --> 00:06:00.640
Because if you do this
task, at the end

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:04.220
of the project after you've got,
you know 10 plug-ins in their

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:07.970
and there's something the matter
it can be a lot of work to sort out

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:11.620
what plug-in introduced the errors.

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:14.200
So, now I'm going to talk about
a particular kind of plug-in

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:16.460
and that's an
accessibility overlay.

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:26.900
And overlays are, I’m going to read
here from the overlayfactsheet.com.

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:31.570
Overlays are a broad term
for technologies that aim

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:35.240
to improve the
accessibility of a website.

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:39.040
They apply third-party source
code (typically JavaScript)

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:42.040
to make improvements to the
front-end code of the website.

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:47.330
And the goal is to make the
site accessible without needing

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:51.590
to do anything else.
And there'll be a lot of people

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:56.560
who you know these days are being
told the site needs to be accessible.

00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:00.270
There's legislation maybe there's
a lawsuit pending can you do

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:02.320
in the next half hour.

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:05.560
And a plug-in like that is
going to look so tempting.

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:09.300
Oh my gosh, I just install
it and activate it and boom,

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:10.510
the site accessible.

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:14.880
Accessibility overlays don't work.

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:16.160
They look like they're working.

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:24.140
They look like they're working
because they add, if you can see,

00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:29.940
if you can use a mouse they add
some things that can be helpful

00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:38.070
for people but if you use assistive
technology, overlays get in there

00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:40.810
and they mess up that technology.

00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:45.560
So, that people who have
specific settings that allow them

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:50.010
to access the web and are
not able to otherwise,

00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:52.720
the overlays interfere with that.

00:07:53.611 --> 00:07:59.400
So, this is to the point where
their software called accessibyebye

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:02.712
that you can download
at accesibyebye.org

00:08:02.713 --> 00:08:07.220
that will turn off overlays
to make the site accessible.

00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:14.210
All right, and then you can
find out more about overlays

00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:16.380
at overlayfacsheet.com.

00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:22.440
So, a quote in here from Lainey
Feingold who is an American lawyer

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:25.630
who specializes in accessibility.

00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:28.870
And she says, And if you need
another reason to say no,

00:08:28.870 --> 00:08:32.180
these tools don't even
protect against lawsuits.

00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:36.950
So, it's not a valuable
solution on any level.

00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:42.840
There is a stop-gap
solution you can use.

00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:45.370
If you're using WordPress.

00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:49.230
And that is a plug-in
by Joe Dawson.

00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:53.520
And it's called a WP
hyphen accessibility.

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:55.260
And I'm quoting Joe here.

00:08:57.150 --> 00:09:00.800
The plug-in is intended to help
with deficiencies commonly found

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:04.730
in themes and to solve some
issues in WordPress core.

00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:12.930
So, most of the plug-ins feature
can be turned off so you just use

00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:14.660
what you really need.

00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:18.120
For example, most themes will
have that skip navigation,

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:20.180
that skipped content link.

00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:25.240
The plug-ins add one but if you've
got one in the theme you're using,

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:26.240
you don't need it.

00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:36.340
So, he says, I don't really
want people to use it forever.

00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:38.230
It's a stop-gap.

00:09:38.230 --> 00:09:42.760
It lets you address
urgent concerns in a way

00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:46.610
that doesn't make things worse
and it gives you that little bit

00:09:46.610 --> 00:09:50.300
of breathing space to find an
accessible theme and implemented

00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:52.160
in a way that keeps it accessible.

00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:59.710
So, again, for accessibility
and plug-ins that relationship.

00:09:59.710 --> 00:10:05.410
You test your theme, you pick your
plug-in carefully using the reviews

00:10:05.410 --> 00:10:10.430
and the number of installs
and when it was updated last

00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:13.260
and how many users are using it.

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:16.830
Install it, activate it,
test the site again and see

00:10:16.830 --> 00:10:18.040
if it made trouble or not.

00:10:19.290 --> 00:10:22.880
And accessibility
overlays do not work

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:29.640
and the WP accessibility
plug-in is a stopgap solution.

00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:33.160
