00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:32.232
[silence]

00:00:32.232 --> 00:00:33.901
>> DANIELLE ZARCARO:
Hello again and welcome

00:00:33.901 --> 00:00:36.640
to WordPress Accessibility Day.

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.760
My name is Danielle and I'm the
founder of Overnight Website

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.910
and Kinetic Iris Web
Development Studio.

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:46.496
Thank you for joining
us for Accessibility

00:00:46.497 --> 00:00:49.890
of Common Gutenberg blocks
with Graham Armfield.

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.830
Graham works with organizations to
help them improve the accessibility

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:57.180
of their websites, testing the
websites for accessibility,

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.526
and advising the
designers and developers

00:00:59.526 --> 00:01:01.720
on how to fix issues found.

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.710
He has written detailed training
courses on accessibility

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.740
for developers, which he
presents on a regular basis.

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.240
Please feel free to add your
questions in the Q&A tab next

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.470
to the video, and we'll answer
them at the end of the session

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.790
and use the ideas section to
chat with other attendees.

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:21.048
Take it away, Graham.

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.930
>> GRAHAM ARMFIELD: Thanks
Danielle, and welcome everyone

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.160
to Accessibility of
Common Gutenberg blocks.

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.280
It was a good
introduction and [laughs]

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:37.820
so I don't need to
say anymore here.

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.088
I've built many,
many accessible websites

00:01:41.089 --> 00:01:43.500
using WordPress over the years

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:48.870
and have contributed something
to accessibility in the core.

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:51.050
I've still got a couple of
things in there which are

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:53.130
for improved accessibility.

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.650
I don't need to say
anything more about myself.

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:58.160
Let's just get straight in.

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.830
Firstly, I want to talk about what
this presentation is not about.

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:05.450
Over the years since Gutenberg
first arrived on the scene,

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.960
there's been a lot of talk about
the accessibility of the editor

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.660
in the admin area.

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.540
Yes, it was a bit of a
dreadful mess to start with.

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.570
It has been improved over the
years, I'm pleased to say,

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:21.370
but it put me off
using Gutenberg really,

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.010
and I've never really
done much with it.

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:31.210
One of my own websites
needs a bit of TLC

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:35.300
and so I thought maybe it's time
to start embracing Gutenberg.

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:41.170
I just wanted to see what it was like
from an accessibility perspective.

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.080
Most of the clients that I've
worked with over the years

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.020
are not at all technical people.

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:51.680
They don't really know much
about HTML or anything like that,

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.140
or Gutenberg or accessibility,
they just want it to work

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.270
and to sell their
products and services.

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:02.040
I wanted to see what it would
be like if I just picked up

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:07.950
some of the Gutenberg blocks and
actually saw what accessible delivery

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.370
that enabled.

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.320
Stuff that the site visitor
actually gets in the browser.

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:15.000
I'm not going to talk about
the admin area at all apart

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.420
from enabling and
disabling some plugins.

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:21.650
Why accessibility is important.

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:25.400
I'm sure you've had people talking
about this throughout the sessions.

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.080
Companies get involved in
accessibility for two reasons.

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:35.015
Partly, they don't want to
get sued and the other reason,

00:03:35.015 --> 00:03:37.752
which is perhaps the more
positive reason is that

00:03:37.752 --> 00:03:41.340
they want to increase their customer
base or the potential customer base

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.900
because when you add up all the
people who have access needs

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.330
that are perhaps different to
yours, it's maybe

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:52.560
about 20% of the population and
accessibility can help everybody.

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:57.030
This picture here is the hill
that leads up from the Thames

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:58.230
in London up to St.

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:00.410
Paul's Cathedral in the background.

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:04.870
It was originally a road, but when
the Millennium Bridge was finished,

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:08.610
it was turned into like a gentle
staircase, but they also put

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:12.340
in this ramp that you can
see crossing the photograph.

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:16.780
It's there for wheelchair
users and people using buggies,

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:17.780
pushchairs, whatever.

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:21.880
If you stand here on this wet
November afternoon about three

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:25.250
or four years ago, you can see
that actually most people prefer

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:28.230
to use the ramp rather
than the stairs.

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:32.460
It's showing you that these
features are used by many people,

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.620
perhaps more than was
originally intended.

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:40.070
The test that I did,
most of this presentation's going

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:44.060
to be a little bit of a live
presentation on some screens

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:45.510
in my browser.

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:49.960
I did some detailed tests
using my Windows 10 laptop,

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.590
the latest Firefox,
and Chrome browsers.

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:56.620
I had WordPress 6.0.2 running,
I know that's not the latest version,

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:01.180
but when I did the tests,
it was the latest version.

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:11.110
I was using Twenty Twenty-One Theme
and Screen Reader was NVDA 2022.2.3

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:12.780
which is almost the latest version.

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:20.180
Now, there are hundreds and
hundreds of Gutenberg blocks.

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:22.500
I couldn't cover all
of them obviously.

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:26.520
I did tech pick up some of
the core ones to start with

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:29.318
and these were ones that are
available in every install

00:05:29.318 --> 00:05:30.697
of WordPress now.

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:34.170
Also, I reached out
and asked some people

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:39.460
which were the other popular ones,
and I chose some from Coblocks,

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:42.110
some from Stackable,
and some from Kadence.

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:45.760
I certainly didn't choose all
of the blocks that are available

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:46.760
from these people.

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:51.160
We'll see what we
have time to cover.

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:54.620
I've only got a short time
so I can't cover everything

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:58.640
and so I'm only going to cover
some common accessibility issues.

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:03.770
I'm focusing more on keyboard
interaction because a lot

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:07.480
of people actually choose
to or have to use a keyboard

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:10.730
instead of a mouse or a trackpad.

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:14.920
I also did some tests
with NVDA Screen Reader,

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:17.680
it's a popular screen reader
that's free to download

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:20.290
on Windows machines and
there's one or two other things

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:21.710
that I might mention as well.

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:25.200
Let's get going.

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:27.490
I'm going to come out
on the presentation now

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:31.660
and you can see a screen
on a test WordPress website

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:33.010
that I've put together.

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:35.870
The first page we are
looking at is simple stuff.

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:40.460
I've pulled together some of the
simpler building block type blocks

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:46.570
from the core, from these
core Coblocks on this page.

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:50.300
We've got a list of items,
we've got some headings here,

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:55.160
heading level 2, heading level
3, et cetera paragraphs

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:58.390
as an ordered list, like a
numbered list, it was a bullet list

00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:02.120
at the top and then
block quotes and verses.

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:05.550
Now, this is all simple stuff
and you'll be pleased to know

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:10.730
that all of this basic building block
stuff is all perfectly accessible.

00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:14.000
I'm not going to talk
anymore about that really.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.290
Let's move on to the next one
where I've got the opportunity

00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:22.850
of putting tables into a
page that is a core block.

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:24.980
I can do a table like this.

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:26.330
I've mocked this up.

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:29.130
It's a list of events
that are happening

00:07:29.131 --> 00:07:31.110
at the Student Union campus.

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:36.340
I've got a table and I was
able, using the core block,

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:38.750
to add column headers.

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:40.430
Now I need to look at my notes.

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:41.430
Where are they?

00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:47.660
There's no way to add a
caption to this table.

00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:53.010
Though using the block, a caption is
like the alternate text list table.

00:07:53.010 --> 00:07:57.030
It's basically a label that
you can set on the table to say

00:07:57.030 --> 00:07:58.840
what this table is showing you.

00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:02.560
Something like a list of the
events in the student campus

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:03.450
or something like that.

00:08:03.450 --> 00:08:07.820
There's no way of doing
that using the block itself.

00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:11.050
That's not great.

00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:14.120
Also, these heading cells,
they are marked up as headers,

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:18.460
but it's missing the scope
attributes, which would be useful

00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:19.530
for some screen readers.

00:08:19.530 --> 00:08:23.100
Some screen readers cope with
that fine, others maybe not.

00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:27.930
I've also tried to create a table,
like a product comparison table

00:08:27.930 --> 00:08:32.290
would be where I've got
features down the left-hand side

00:08:32.290 --> 00:08:36.180
and some products across the top.

00:08:36.180 --> 00:08:39.900
Obviously, once again put
together just as an example here.

00:08:41.830 --> 00:08:44.940
Here I've got column headers,
like Feature, Austin Mini,

00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:49.600
and Escort Mark 1 van,
and then I have row headers.

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:54.620
Now, sadly in the plugin at the
moment, sorry, the core block,

00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:58.630
there is no way of
adding row headers.

00:08:58.630 --> 00:09:02.790
This table, I actually put
these in by hand just to see

00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:05.010
if it was feasible that way.

00:09:05.010 --> 00:09:08.700
It is, but using the block
itself and if someone

00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:12.170
has no technical knowledge and
they won't know what to do,

00:09:12.170 --> 00:09:15.450
then there's no way of
doing a suitable something

00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:17.500
like a product comparison table.

00:09:19.070 --> 00:09:19.660
Moving on.

00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:21.840
That's all about tables
I'm going to talk about.

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:28.470
The next one I'm going to look at is
media, which is effectively images.

00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:33.230
I've added some images to the
site, to this page.

00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:36.180
I've got a plain image with
a caption, I've also set

00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:39.450
the alternate text and that
is revealed there so it's good

00:09:39.450 --> 00:09:41.740
for screen reader users as well.

00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:44.350
The next one I tried
was the cover image.

00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:49.880
Now, this puts text directly
on top of an image, so I chose

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:55.050
to actually darken the user
darker overlay on the image

00:09:55.050 --> 00:09:57.760
just to make the text
visible because of course

00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:00.850
if you have a light
image with light text,

00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:03.210
then it can make the text
quite difficult to read

00:10:03.210 --> 00:10:06.430
but I was able to sort that
out, so that's good.

00:10:06.430 --> 00:10:09.530
The next one I've got is
this media and text block.

00:10:09.530 --> 00:10:13.610
I've got a picture of a guitar
here with some texts next to it.

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:21.140
Down the bottom here I've got the
gallery and these are quite good

00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:26.570
because two of these are interactive
elements because I set them up

00:10:26.570 --> 00:10:28.240
to show you.

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:30.560
This one shows you
the larger image.

00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:34.570
You can see I've tabs
to this and it has got

00:10:34.570 --> 00:10:36.840
a good focus indication there.

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:41.210
If I press the tab key again,
once again a good focus indication.

00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:45.450
The third image doesn't have any
functionality attached to it.

00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:49.610
If I go to Wembury Beach
and the alternate text

00:10:49.610 --> 00:10:54.470
for this image is set appropriately
if I press the enter key now,

00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:59.270
you can see it shows
me a full-size image.

00:10:59.270 --> 00:11:07.280
However, if you look on the
underlying code here, which I shall,

00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:10.070
the image itself,
the alt attribute, which is

00:11:10.070 --> 00:11:14.180
how you set the alternate
text, is actually set to a URL.

00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:18.280
This is no good at all and
it really ought to be set

00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:23.150
to the alternate text that's
stored in the database.

00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:26.370
WordPress has alternate text
stored against this image,

00:11:26.370 --> 00:11:28.080
but it's not retrieving it.

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:29.690
That's a slight issue.

00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:31.680
It's better than perhaps
the classic editor

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:35.300
because there was no all attribute
there at all in the classic editor,

00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:37.840
but it could be better definitely.

00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:42.730
Okay, so let's get rid of that
and go back to where I was before.

00:11:42.730 --> 00:11:48.510
That's all the images and that's
all of the core Gutenberg blocks

00:11:48.510 --> 00:11:50.440
that I looked at.

00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:54.080
I have three other pages
that I've set up for,

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:56.370
the other blocks
that I'm looking at.

00:11:56.370 --> 00:11:59.800
What I'll need to do first is
enable the plugins for these.

00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:03.850
Let's do the Coblocks ones first,
so let's activate that one.

00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:09.600
Slightly frustratingly, if I have
all of these plugins going at once,

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:12.820
they do kind of contend with
each other a little bit,

00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:15.120
so that's a bit unfortunate.

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:19.370
If you want to use some Coblocks
blocks, some Stackable blocks,

00:12:19.370 --> 00:12:23.050
and some Kadence blocks,
I guess one day that will help.

00:12:23.050 --> 00:12:26.270
Okay, so here we are
on the Cooblocks page.

00:12:26.270 --> 00:12:29.440
Now the first one I've
got is a hero image.

00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:31.250
Where's my notes again?

00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:34.400
Once again I've got text
directly on the image,

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:38.370
but I've specifically
chosen a darker image here.

00:12:38.370 --> 00:12:43.300
This was taken almost at sunset and
so the text shows up quite nicely.

00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:46.750
If you had a light image, I'm sure
it's possible to change the color

00:12:46.750 --> 00:12:48.310
of this text appropriately.

00:12:48.310 --> 00:12:52.490
It would be nice to be able to put
some kind of underlay under there.

00:12:52.490 --> 00:12:53.550
I've got these links here.

00:12:53.550 --> 00:12:56.760
The first one, I don't know why
the hover means it disappears.

00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:58.900
I'll have to investigate
further why that is.

00:13:00.010 --> 00:13:03.260
Also, they do have a
good focus indication.

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:08.320
I've tabs to the first link now
and then the second one and this,

00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:12.720
you can set the link text
however you want, so that's okay.

00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:18.600
The next elements are
accordions and you this uses the

00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:22.100
more modern HTML 5 summary
in details elements,

00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:24.950
which are now widely
supported by browsers

00:13:24.950 --> 00:13:28.520
and also assisted technologies
like screen readers.

00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:33.670
That's good I can click on
these things and that works okay

00:13:33.670 --> 00:13:35.770
and they do work fine
in screen readers.

00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:40.360
The actual keyboard
focus that's set on this

00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:42.750
and I couldn't change
this is very subtle.

00:13:42.750 --> 00:13:47.050
You can see if there's a focus ring
around this more information one,

00:13:47.050 --> 00:13:50.870
if I do shift that, you can see
where I've made the accordion

00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:53.140
have a dark background.

00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:55.134
The keyboard focus indication

00:13:55.134 --> 00:13:58.370
is completely almost
invisible basically.

00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:02.500
The next thing on this page is
highlighted text and literally,

00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:04.440
it's just changing
the color of the text.

00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:06.840
That's not a problem.

00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:11.840
You can choose combinations
that work for you.

00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:13.330
After that would say, "Tweet this."

00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:18.880
What this actually does is it tweets
this page so it's like a share thing.

00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:23.680
If I tab to that,
it actually disappears

00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:27.100
because it sets the background
image of the button to white

00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:29.020
and there's white
text on top of it.

00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:34.580
Maybe there's a way of changing
that, but I haven't found it yet.

00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:38.780
Also for screen readers,
this is not that informative really

00:14:38.780 --> 00:14:43.520
to just say tweet as
the link text here.

00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:44.980
It's not really telling me enough.

00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:49.350
It doesn't tell me exactly
what it does, but there we go.

00:14:49.350 --> 00:14:50.690
That could be better.

00:14:50.690 --> 00:14:53.670
The next thing we've got on
this page is the carousel.

00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:58.590
A nice big wide image here and
if I click on these images,

00:14:58.590 --> 00:15:00.850
you can see it changes them.

00:15:00.850 --> 00:15:05.140
Now you'll notice that there's
a subtle focus indication there.

00:15:05.140 --> 00:15:09.410
Notice the white dots, when I
hover over it, they turn black.

00:15:09.410 --> 00:15:14.440
If I press the tab key, quite
difficult to see, but they do work.

00:15:17.370 --> 00:15:20.360
If I press the enter key now
it does change [inaudible].

00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:23.520
The keyboard functionality is
quite good there, except that

00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:27.060
if I do shift-tab and
then shift-tab again,

00:15:28.590 --> 00:15:31.160
I have moved keyboard
focus up the page.

00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:36.700
You can't tell, but it is now
this big image here has got focus.

00:15:37.710 --> 00:15:41.710
I don't know why they've done that
because there's no functionality.

00:15:41.710 --> 00:15:46.060
I'm clicking on this image at the
moment and nothing's happening.

00:15:46.060 --> 00:15:49.420
A screen reader user will,
when they arrive at this image,

00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:54.410
they'll get the alternate text okay,
but it'll tell them it's clickable

00:15:54.410 --> 00:16:00.030
because there is some kind of
trigger that says they thin,

00:16:00.030 --> 00:16:04.130
"Actually something happens here,"
because images wouldn't normally

00:16:04.130 --> 00:16:05.550
get focus.

00:16:05.550 --> 00:16:08.820
That's a little bit confusing.

00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:12.138
Let's move focus down here
so I know where it is.

00:16:12.138 --> 00:16:14.807
I haven't got anything
else to say about that.

00:16:19.045 --> 00:16:20.046
Oh yes.

00:16:20.046 --> 00:16:21.080
That's right.

00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:27.600
From a screen reader user's
perspective, these images here are

00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:30.590
in a button, which is good
because buttons are things

00:16:30.590 --> 00:16:32.650
that trigger functionality.

00:16:32.650 --> 00:16:37.460
The image itself has some
appropriate alternate text

00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:38.270
if only I could find it.

00:16:38.270 --> 00:16:38.910
There we go.

00:16:38.910 --> 00:16:41.900
Wembury Beach [inaudible].

00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:47.010
However, the button itself,
they've actually given it aria-label.

00:16:47.010 --> 00:16:52.760
Now, aria-label is useful thing to
give something an accessible label,

00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:55.229
but what it does is it overrides

00:16:55.230 --> 00:16:58.470
whatever was the
accessible label before

00:16:58.470 --> 00:17:02.260
in this case, which was Wembury
Beach, but now the aria-label

00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:05.610
for all of these buttons is
set to gallery thumbnail.

00:17:05.610 --> 00:17:09.600
That's much less useful
for screen reader users

00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:12.100
because they don't get to
hear Wembury Beach, they get

00:17:12.100 --> 00:17:15.060
to hear that it's a button
for gallery thumbnail.

00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:18.200
There's also a tab index
of zero on that unnecessary

00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:20.330
since buttons get focused anyway.

00:17:21.930 --> 00:17:25.420
We'll keep the code
window open for a bit.

00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:26.580
Let's move down to here.

00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:30.830
Keyboard focus is currently
on this image here.

00:17:30.830 --> 00:17:34.990
If I tab and tab again, it's on
the last of those three images.

00:17:34.990 --> 00:17:38.970
What's next on the page is--
actually we'll get rid of that--

00:17:38.970 --> 00:17:42.290
is this offset with lightbox
block where I can do,

00:17:42.290 --> 00:17:45.960
there's like a gallery,
but I can actually click on these

00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:48.340
and it shows me a lightbox.

00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:49.070
That's fine.

00:17:49.070 --> 00:17:51.600
Mouse users are catered for.

00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:55.840
Now if I press the tab key focus
is actually on this image up here.

00:17:55.840 --> 00:18:00.870
I'd expect these images to get
focus because I want keyboard users

00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:05.550
to be able to trigger the lightbox
too but if I press tab key,

00:18:05.550 --> 00:18:09.930
you'll see the focus ends
up on the Coblocks form.

00:18:09.930 --> 00:18:12.480
It's completely missed
out all of these images,

00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:16.930
even though they are actually
interactive elements.

00:18:16.930 --> 00:18:19.570
That's the huge problem
for keyboard users here.

00:18:19.570 --> 00:18:20.670
If I click on this one.

00:18:20.670 --> 00:18:24.580
You can see it does
deliver a lightbox.

00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:28.810
Now ironically when this is
open, I can actually use the left

00:18:28.810 --> 00:18:33.580
and right arrow keys to actually
swivel through the images.

00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:36.350
There's nothing to tell me that
that happens, but of course,

00:18:37.630 --> 00:18:39.520
as a Keyboard user,
I wouldn't ever be here

00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:42.110
because I can't
trigger the lightbox.

00:18:42.110 --> 00:18:44.130
Also for screen readers.

00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:48.740
What's the note about
screen readers here?

00:18:53.230 --> 00:18:55.920
We have the wrong bit.

00:18:55.920 --> 00:19:00.240
Okay, these images have no alt
attribute, which is not good

00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:05.200
and because focus is not transferred
into the lightbox, it's still

00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:09.910
on the underlying page, so I
can't access these buttons at all.

00:19:11.020 --> 00:19:12.020
That's not great.

00:19:13.290 --> 00:19:14.530
Let's get rid of that.

00:19:14.530 --> 00:19:16.080
It does listen out
for this gate key.

00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:20.840
Some keyboard accessibility is coded
for, but just not letting you get

00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:23.330
into the lightbox
in the first place.

00:19:23.330 --> 00:19:25.760
Let's move focus onto the form.

00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:28.580
The next thing I've got here,
I've created this little form

00:19:28.580 --> 00:19:33.490
in using Coblocks rock and it's
got name first and last, phone,

00:19:33.490 --> 00:19:34.720
email, et cetera.

00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:39.150
Now happily,
most of this form is pretty good

00:19:39.150 --> 00:19:40.790
from an accessibility perspective.

00:19:40.790 --> 00:19:42.540
The focus indication is good.

00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:48.140
You can see a nice clear
dotted line around that thing,

00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:49.940
around the input field.

00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:53.890
For screen reading users, there's
a problem with this first one.

00:19:53.890 --> 00:19:57.980
There is actually a code error
in the block, which means

00:19:57.980 --> 00:20:04.290
that the first and last name,
which is a common thing you'll see

00:20:04.290 --> 00:20:08.630
in websites, these are not
linked up with the label.

00:20:08.630 --> 00:20:11.270
What's important when you are
putting a form together is

00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:15.980
that the label here, the prompt for
the form is programmatically linked

00:20:15.980 --> 00:20:17.450
to the input field.

00:20:17.450 --> 00:20:19.050
That's not the case
with these two because

00:20:19.050 --> 00:20:22.320
there's obviously been a mistake
in the way it's been put together.

00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:27.020
I don't get any useful information
from the first and last name bits

00:20:27.020 --> 00:20:27.960
at the top.

00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:31.560
The other problem with
this form is that here,

00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:33.340
I've got a radio button
group that I added.

00:20:33.340 --> 00:20:36.240
It's asking me whether I
want sugar in my coffee,

00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:38.160
so I've got a yes-no option there.

00:20:39.210 --> 00:20:42.710
When I tab to this or move
to this in a screen reader,

00:20:42.710 --> 00:20:46.470
it will tell me that the label
for this radio button is yes

00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:50.080
and then no,
but it doesn't read out the question

00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:55.060
when I'm using NVDA, because it's
not in a fieldset, in a legend.

00:20:55.060 --> 00:20:58.170
Whenever you've got a radio button
group, you need to use fieldset

00:20:58.170 --> 00:21:02.910
and legend to help everyone
understand what's going on.

00:21:02.910 --> 00:21:03.910
There we go.

00:21:04.970 --> 00:21:06.110
The form's pretty good.

00:21:06.110 --> 00:21:08.100
There's a bit button
is fine as well.

00:21:10.060 --> 00:21:14.460
Then the only other Coblocks block
I used was this pricing table

00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:16.040
just to see how it put out.

00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:18.600
It's all plain text
with these links here.

00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:21.740
Then this is down to how,
however, you choose the link text,

00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:23.520
whether or not that's accessible.

00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:25.450
That's all fine.

00:21:25.450 --> 00:21:25.940
There we go.

00:21:25.940 --> 00:21:28.360
That's the Coblocks blocks.

00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:33.790
Now before we move on to Stackable,
I'll need to deactivate Coblocks.

00:21:33.790 --> 00:21:37.830
This is a little bit annoying
every time you deactivate Coblocks,

00:21:37.830 --> 00:21:42.690
it wants to know why.

00:21:42.690 --> 00:21:44.200
Which one was I going to do next?

00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:45.220
Stackable.

00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:46.480
Let's find that one.

00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:51.980
Okay, Stackable's running now.

00:21:51.980 --> 00:21:53.720
We can go to the Stackable page.

00:21:55.870 --> 00:22:01.810
First one I chose was the hero title
block and a similar sort of thing.

00:22:01.810 --> 00:22:03.310
I've used an image as a background.

00:22:03.310 --> 00:22:07.960
Then I've got some text
and a link on top of that.

00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:10.240
You can customize the
colors how you want.

00:22:11.450 --> 00:22:12.890
That's good.

00:22:12.890 --> 00:22:14.630
I could quite easily set that up.

00:22:14.630 --> 00:22:17.930
It was hard to read the text
on the image but actually,

00:22:17.930 --> 00:22:22.220
assuming you have the good
enough contrast, it's fine.

00:22:22.220 --> 00:22:23.720
Let's move down in my notes.

00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:27.680
The next one I'm going to talk
about is these accordions.

00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:31.440
Once again, these are done
using the HTML 5 summary

00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:33.510
and details elements
and that's good.

00:22:33.510 --> 00:22:38.450
If I tab to them, most very
clear keyboard focus indication

00:22:38.450 --> 00:22:43.320
and action number there, any problems
and screen readers all support,

00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:45.180
summary and details now.

00:22:45.180 --> 00:22:47.180
That's all good.

00:22:47.180 --> 00:22:50.780
The next one's an interesting
one, the show more or less.

00:22:50.780 --> 00:22:53.500
If I tap there to that, good.

00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:57.060
There's a focus indication there
and this works a little bit

00:22:57.060 --> 00:23:00.090
like an accordion,
but if you look the text above here,

00:23:01.270 --> 00:23:07.530
when I press the enter key, what it
does is it actually replaces the text

00:23:07.530 --> 00:23:10.800
that was here earlier
with some newer text,

00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:14.500
presumably some more expanded
text, but focus stays on button,

00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:16.020
which is very good.

00:23:16.020 --> 00:23:20.990
The only problem with this is
that screen reader users like

00:23:20.990 --> 00:23:24.040
if it's an accordion,
when you open an accordion,

00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:28.680
the new content appears beneath and
most screen reader users will assume

00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:31.070
that the new content is
going to appear beneath.

00:23:31.070 --> 00:23:35.860
In this case, the content is changed
above where you are on the screen.

00:23:35.860 --> 00:23:40.040
A lot of screen reader users
will not find the amended text.

00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:44.760
Next one, button group.

00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:50.150
How are we doing for time?

00:23:50.150 --> 00:23:56.400
These button groups, you can see
that these are all for social media.

00:23:56.400 --> 00:23:59.760
The social media icons on the
page, Facebook, Twitter,

00:24:01.260 --> 00:24:03.130
that's Instagram and then YouTube.

00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:08.550
If I hover over these, there's a
subtle change for hover focuses

00:24:08.550 --> 00:24:10.970
on here at the moment.

00:24:12.050 --> 00:24:13.430
Let me do a tab key.

00:24:14.780 --> 00:24:16.550
Now you probably won't
be able to see it.

00:24:16.550 --> 00:24:18.270
I can only just see it.

00:24:18.270 --> 00:24:21.910
Focus is now on the Facebook icon.

00:24:21.910 --> 00:24:27.270
If I press the tab key again,
there's a very, very brief change

00:24:27.270 --> 00:24:32.900
of the sort of like I think it's
the border of the thing itself

00:24:32.900 --> 00:24:36.740
or maybe it grows I size slightly,
I I press the tab key again.

00:24:36.740 --> 00:24:39.580
That is not good from
a keyboard perspective.

00:24:39.580 --> 00:24:40.770
These links are active.

00:24:40.770 --> 00:24:45.670
I could actually take you to--
If I'm on the YouTube one,

00:24:45.670 --> 00:24:49.867
if I press the enter key,
it will actually take me

00:24:49.868 --> 00:24:51.760
to my YouTube channel.

00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:53.450
Let's go back to where we were.

00:24:54.650 --> 00:24:58.180
I think I need to ensure that
we're in the right place now.

00:25:00.460 --> 00:25:06.180
On some of these things, focus seems
to disappear all over the place

00:25:06.180 --> 00:25:08.260
which is not good from a
keyboard user's perspective.

00:25:10.460 --> 00:25:17.170
Keyboard users can use these but
the real problem is what happens

00:25:17.170 --> 00:25:18.410
for screen reader users.

00:25:18.410 --> 00:25:24.430
If we look at these
elements, they are links

00:25:26.260 --> 00:25:31.410
but what the link
contains is an SVG file.

00:25:31.410 --> 00:25:37.740
Now that's not a surprise
to you but at the SVG file

00:25:37.740 --> 00:25:41.750
as it's defined here,
has no accessible content at all.

00:25:42.910 --> 00:25:46.540
A screen reader user will
know that there's a link there

00:25:46.540 --> 00:25:50.020
because the screen reader
will recognize the a-tag

00:25:50.020 --> 00:25:54.950
but there is nothing
meaningful inside that link

00:25:54.950 --> 00:25:57.450
to tell screen reader
users what it's for.

00:25:57.450 --> 00:26:02.460
That is a completely useless block
from an accessibility perspective

00:26:03.470 --> 00:26:05.870
because it's not really
good for keyboard users

00:26:05.870 --> 00:26:09.580
and it certainly isn't good
for screen reader users either.

00:26:10.810 --> 00:26:14.190
What else have we got on this page?

00:26:14.190 --> 00:26:18.040
The other block I've chosen is cards
and I've put two of these together.

00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:21.160
Let's move that out the way.

00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:21.880
These are fine.

00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:25.140
It's got an image at the top that's
got the correct alternate text

00:26:25.140 --> 00:26:26.170
attached to it.

00:26:26.170 --> 00:26:29.350
I've got a heading in here
and then some plain text.

00:26:29.350 --> 00:26:35.750
I put a link in this one and these
also are links at the bottom.

00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:41.280
Interestingly if I tab to
it, these links disappear.

00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:44.990
Once again, this seems to be a
problem with some of these blocks

00:26:44.990 --> 00:26:47.690
or maybe it's just the theme
settings, I don't know.

00:26:47.690 --> 00:26:51.540
When I tab these things
they just disappear

00:26:51.540 --> 00:26:55.590
because the background color changes
to the same as the font color.

00:26:56.940 --> 00:27:00.020
which is a bit awkward really.

00:27:00.020 --> 00:27:03.350
That is all of the Stackable
ones that I'm going to demo.

00:27:03.350 --> 00:27:07.160
I've got some time left so
I'm going to have a quick look

00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:08.590
at some Kadence blocks.

00:27:10.100 --> 00:27:12.180
Once again, going back to plugins.

00:27:13.420 --> 00:27:21.550
Let's get Stackable and deactivate
that and activate Kadence

00:27:25.350 --> 00:27:27.090
and we'll move to the Kadence page.

00:27:30.070 --> 00:27:34.240
Some good stuff in here actually,
I was pleased to discover.

00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:38.920
The first thing is what they've got
a block called table of contents,

00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:41.990
which is a nice idea if you've
got a very long blog post

00:27:43.470 --> 00:27:44.600
with lots of headings.

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:48.130
This is the block for you.

00:27:48.130 --> 00:27:51.650
It helps people find parts of the
page they might be interested in

00:27:51.650 --> 00:27:54.230
because there are in-page
links down to the headings

00:27:54.230 --> 00:27:55.690
and that works quite nicely.

00:27:57.920 --> 00:28:00.130
As long as you've got headings
set up properly that is,

00:28:00.130 --> 00:28:03.730
including it takes into account
like your heading levels,

00:28:03.730 --> 00:28:05.030
your heading hierarchy.

00:28:05.030 --> 00:28:05.970
That's quite good.

00:28:05.970 --> 00:28:09.110
The only thing that's wrong
here really with this is that

00:28:09.110 --> 00:28:13.260
that is an obvious candidate to
be made heading, but it isn't.

00:28:13.260 --> 00:28:15.130
It's just bold text.

00:28:15.130 --> 00:28:17.810
That's my only criticism of
the table of contents thing.

00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:22.480
Further down the page
we've got accordions.

00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:24.660
Now, these are not done
with summary and details.

00:28:24.660 --> 00:28:29.320
These are done with the old,
older, slightly older method

00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:32.680
of doing accordions but they
are perfectly accessible.

00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:35.780
If I was building an accordion
myself and not using summary

00:28:35.780 --> 00:28:38.680
and details,
this is exactly how I would do it.

00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:44.910
I could click on them and they've got
a nice good keybard focus indication

00:28:44.910 --> 00:28:47.280
and they are good for
screen readers as well

00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:51.090
because they use all the
necessary ARIA attributes

00:28:51.090 --> 00:28:53.910
to make it perfectly
accessible, which is good.

00:28:55.470 --> 00:28:56.470
Moving on.

00:28:56.880 --> 00:28:59.280
Next one I've got is a tab panel.

00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:01.290
There's a slight problem with
the appearance of this one

00:29:01.290 --> 00:29:05.170
because tab 3 is not as
high as the other two

00:29:05.170 --> 00:29:09.530
but this is pretty good
where keyboard focus is here.

00:29:09.530 --> 00:29:15.480
If I tab to the tab panel, the
focus is there, it's on this panel

00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:16.340
at the moment.

00:29:16.340 --> 00:29:18.900
It disappears immediately
though, that's the problem

00:29:18.900 --> 00:29:22.860
because you're not certain
now where keyboard focus is.

00:29:22.860 --> 00:29:27.470
It actually uses the official
way of doing tab panels

00:29:27.470 --> 00:29:31.480
from keyboard operability
and accessibility.

00:29:31.480 --> 00:29:33.740
I've tabbed to the
first tab header.

00:29:33.740 --> 00:29:38.290
If I want to move to any of the
other tab headers using a keyboard,

00:29:38.290 --> 00:29:41.290
I will actually use the
left and right arrow keys.

00:29:41.290 --> 00:29:46.150
I'll press the right arrow key
now and we can see that it's moved

00:29:46.150 --> 00:29:50.910
to the second one and
then the third one.

00:29:50.910 --> 00:29:54.420
I'm using the left arrow key to
move back to where I was before.

00:29:56.180 --> 00:29:58.030
That's pretty good.

00:29:58.030 --> 00:30:02.030
That's exactly how you should
build a tab panel to work.

00:30:02.030 --> 00:30:07.330
Also, the ARIA underneath is
absolutely correct as well.

00:30:11.410 --> 00:30:13.520
Yes, so that's
pretty good actually.

00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:17.600
Apart from the slight appearance
problem here, and the fact

00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:20.200
that the keyboard focus
disappears very quickly.

00:30:21.230 --> 00:30:24.820
Okay, underneath, it's a testimonial
block, there's nothing much going on

00:30:24.820 --> 00:30:29.360
in here, so I won't say
anything more about that.

00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:33.320
Now, we've got the gallery,
and lightbox, click on that,

00:30:33.320 --> 00:30:37.080
and it shows me a lightbox
again, which is good.

00:30:37.080 --> 00:30:38.860
Let's get rid of that.

00:30:38.860 --> 00:30:42.790
Now, I'm going to put the focus
back up here so I know exactly,

00:30:42.790 --> 00:30:44.040
where focus is.

00:30:44.040 --> 00:30:46.340
Focus is on the tab
panel at the moment.

00:30:46.340 --> 00:30:50.300
If I press the tab key,
I would expect focus to end up here.

00:30:50.300 --> 00:30:53.730
There's nothing in the
testimonial that's interactive.

00:30:53.730 --> 00:30:58.730
I would expect focus to end up
here when I press the tab key.

00:30:58.730 --> 00:31:01.090
Now, focus does end
up on that image,

00:31:01.090 --> 00:31:05.510
but it has absolutely no
focus indication, okay?

00:31:05.510 --> 00:31:13.610
I can press the enter key,
and it does show me the lightbox.

00:31:13.610 --> 00:31:17.150
Now, if I press the tab key to
try, and move to any of these

00:31:17.150 --> 00:31:20.340
as if I'm a sighted keyboard
user, I want to potentially get

00:31:20.340 --> 00:31:24.280
to these buttons to move through
the images, or close the lightbox.

00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:29.860
If I press the tab key nothing
happens, but actually, I'm still

00:31:29.860 --> 00:31:31.100
on the underlying page.

00:31:31.100 --> 00:31:32.830
That is a problem.

00:31:32.830 --> 00:31:37.240
With the lightbox, you always
want, when I open the lightbox

00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:40.130
for focus to be put
inside the lightbox.

00:31:40.130 --> 00:31:42.850
Otherwise, keyboard users
are not really going to know

00:31:42.850 --> 00:31:46.530
what's going on,
and they can't really use it.

00:31:46.530 --> 00:31:50.090
Now, it does have the left
and right arrow functionality

00:31:50.090 --> 00:31:53.160
as the other one I showed
you before did have,

00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:55.150
and also I can press
the escape key.

00:31:56.650 --> 00:32:01.040
It kind of is keyboard accessible,
but there's nothing anywhere

00:32:01.040 --> 00:32:03.980
to tell the user what
keystrokes are relevant.

00:32:05.170 --> 00:32:11.000
Also, the focus indication on
the actual images could be nice.

00:32:12.860 --> 00:32:16.810
I'm thinking that focus indication's
going to be on that first image.

00:32:16.810 --> 00:32:18.250
There it is.

00:32:18.250 --> 00:32:21.740
Now, the next thing that's going
to get focus is this info box here,

00:32:21.740 --> 00:32:24.330
which is effectively one big link.

00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:29.480
Let me press the tab key
again, and again.

00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:33.630
Now, when I press the tab key,
focus will go to the info box.

00:32:35.010 --> 00:32:38.210
Notice that the focus
indication is there in ABLE,

00:32:38.210 --> 00:32:42.340
you might not even have seen
it across the web there.

00:32:42.340 --> 00:32:44.060
It flashes very, very briefly.

00:32:44.060 --> 00:32:45.900
It's less than a second.

00:32:45.900 --> 00:32:49.070
Focus indications if they
just immediately disappear,

00:32:49.070 --> 00:32:52.300
that's not at all helpful, okay?

00:32:52.300 --> 00:32:53.610
Now, focus, it's on that.

00:32:53.610 --> 00:32:55.010
It actually is a link.

00:32:55.010 --> 00:32:59.470
The whole thing is a link
back to the simple stuff page.

00:33:00.810 --> 00:33:03.880
Whatever you put in here
effectively becomes the link text.

00:33:05.310 --> 00:33:07.420
Since it's going back to one
of the other block pages,

00:33:07.420 --> 00:33:10.720
that's probably, not appropriate
text, but that's down

00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:13.130
to what you choose to put in it.

00:33:13.130 --> 00:33:14.430
How am I doing for time?

00:33:14.430 --> 00:33:16.030
I think I'm okay.

00:33:16.030 --> 00:33:19.720
Let's move down, and look,
I've done a form here as well,

00:33:19.720 --> 00:33:23.510
and I'm very pleased to relate
that this form is generally,

00:33:23.510 --> 00:33:26.290
pretty good from an
accessibility perspective.

00:33:26.290 --> 00:33:30.380
I've got nice focus indication going
on here on all of these things,

00:33:30.380 --> 00:33:34.350
I can tab to each of
them, and this works okay.

00:33:34.350 --> 00:33:35.420
That's a selection.

00:33:36.890 --> 00:33:41.880
The only slight problem
here is these radio buttons.

00:33:41.880 --> 00:33:43.900
They're very, very tiny.

00:33:43.900 --> 00:33:46.840
They're almost tinier than
perhaps the native ones.

00:33:46.840 --> 00:33:48.780
I don't know, I'm not quite sure
how that's done, but they're very,

00:33:48.780 --> 00:33:49.780
very small.

00:33:51.420 --> 00:33:55.200
They work okay, except for
the fact that the other form

00:33:55.200 --> 00:34:00.590
I showed you before, these are
not contained in the fieldset

00:34:00.590 --> 00:34:01.590
or with a legend.

00:34:03.160 --> 00:34:07.660
Yes, I will hear that this radio
button is for eating take away,

00:34:07.660 --> 00:34:08.740
and delivery.

00:34:08.740 --> 00:34:14.250
Now, I might guess that
that is about my options for

00:34:14.250 --> 00:34:18.470
how I want my food, but it
doesn't read out eating options

00:34:18.470 --> 00:34:23.140
in a screen reader, because it's
not marked up in a fieldset,

00:34:23.140 --> 00:34:24.150
in a legend.

00:34:24.150 --> 00:34:25.560
That would be really nice.

00:34:25.560 --> 00:34:28.940
Otherwise, this form is very good,
because if I submit this form,

00:34:28.940 --> 00:34:33.120
having indicated that these
fields are all mandatory

00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:35.680
and that it could be slightly
better from a screen reader user

00:34:35.680 --> 00:34:36.460
perspective.

00:34:36.460 --> 00:34:39.260
If they used ARIA
required on there.

00:34:39.260 --> 00:34:44.330
If I submit the form, it produces
appropriate error messages,

00:34:44.330 --> 00:34:48.240
and these are all accessible
as well to a screen reader.

00:34:48.240 --> 00:34:49.870
That is really, really good.

00:34:49.870 --> 00:34:54.180
Yes, that's nice.

00:34:57.540 --> 00:34:59.060
What else can I say about this?

00:34:59.060 --> 00:35:00.200
That's it.

00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:04.210
Okay, so that's all of the
Kadence blocks that I've covered.

00:35:05.860 --> 00:35:06.880
There we go.

00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:08.130
That's pretty good actually.

00:35:08.130 --> 00:35:09.720
Most of that stuff's pretty good.

00:35:09.720 --> 00:35:11.550
Few tweaks here, and there.

00:35:11.550 --> 00:35:13.460
That could be much better.

00:35:13.460 --> 00:35:21.980
Now, let's move back
into my presentation.

00:35:21.980 --> 00:35:24.330
It's a bit early in the morning
here, half asleep still.

00:35:24.330 --> 00:35:25.540
Sorry.

00:35:25.540 --> 00:35:29.540
Yes, now, I have found some issues,
and I started doing the testing

00:35:29.540 --> 00:35:35.830
a few weeks ago, and I found
some issues, and I have reported

00:35:35.830 --> 00:35:39.430
some of them,
and already some have been fixed.

00:35:39.430 --> 00:35:41.180
I think in the Coblocks
ones, a couple

00:35:41.180 --> 00:35:44.100
of the issues have already
been fixed, which is nice.

00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:47.040
It's good that the plugin
authors are responding to that.

00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:50.460
There are some, which I haven't
reported yet, which I will.

00:35:50.460 --> 00:35:53.150
There are others I think
it's-- I can't remember.

00:35:53.150 --> 00:35:56.370
I'm not going to say who,
but where I did get pushback

00:35:56.370 --> 00:35:59.440
on something, so I'm going
to have to work a bit harder

00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:01.460
to get people to
actually improve stuff.

00:36:03.860 --> 00:36:05.030
There we go.

00:36:05.030 --> 00:36:11.110
That is my quick demo of some
and some Gutenberg blocks looking

00:36:11.110 --> 00:36:14.400
at the accessibility
for your site visitors.

00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:19.110
That is it for my presentation.

00:36:28.019 --> 00:36:28.730
>> DANIELLE: Awesome.

00:36:28.730 --> 00:36:33.130
Thank you so much for all of
the really useful information.

00:36:33.130 --> 00:36:39.600
I find it, especially, useful for
the block libraries, these plugins,

00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:44.460
because I won't often
install other random ones.

00:36:44.460 --> 00:36:47.300
I tend to stick with the core ones.

00:36:47.300 --> 00:36:51.560
I really liked the walkthrough
and seeing which one is ahead

00:36:51.560 --> 00:36:53.960
of the others for right now.

00:36:53.960 --> 00:36:57.790
>> GRAHAM: Yes, it's interesting,
and it's a bit of a frustration

00:36:57.790 --> 00:37:01.090
as I mentioned that,
if you want some Coblocks ones,

00:37:01.090 --> 00:37:02.710
and some Stackable
ones, and some Kadence,

00:37:02.710 --> 00:37:05.570
if you have all three
plugins running, some of them

00:37:05.570 --> 00:37:09.200
just don't work properly,
which is the real pain basically.

00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:09.600
>> DANIELLE: Yes.

00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:10.890
Really interesting.

00:37:10.890 --> 00:37:14.970
I'm sure there's lots of
workarounds that people are starting

00:37:14.970 --> 00:37:15.970
to figure out.

00:37:17.050 --> 00:37:20.210
Yes, we have a couple
of questions for now.

00:37:20.210 --> 00:37:23.670
As a reminder to anyone watching,
you can enter your questions

00:37:23.670 --> 00:37:28.070
in the Q&A tab next
to the Livestream.

00:37:28.070 --> 00:37:33.730
Our first question is, do any of
the block providers give information

00:37:33.730 --> 00:37:36.810
about the accessibility of
the blocks in their libraries,

00:37:36.810 --> 00:37:39.800
or was all of this,
start-- you had no idea

00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:40.890
what you were getting into?

00:37:42.260 --> 00:37:44.260
>> GRAHAM: It was
really the latter there.

00:37:44.260 --> 00:37:46.360
I had no idea what
I was getting into.

00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:51.380
As I mentioned before,
I kind of stayed away from Gutenburg

00:37:51.380 --> 00:37:56.860
because I was so disenchanted with
the accessibility of the admin area.

00:37:57.880 --> 00:37:59.140
I kind of avoided using it.

00:37:59.140 --> 00:38:01.900
I'm still using the classic
editor on most of the websites

00:38:01.900 --> 00:38:05.770
that I'm doing, all of the
websites I that I built for myself.

00:38:08.340 --> 00:38:13.600
I had no information at all,
and I chose those three plugins.

00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:16.430
I did look at a couple of others
as well, but these were nice.

00:38:16.430 --> 00:38:22.370
Good ones to look at,
based on advice from other people.

00:38:22.370 --> 00:38:29.150
I have found no information at all
on those plugins about accessibility.

00:38:29.150 --> 00:38:32.560
Now, I'm not saying there isn't any,
but I haven't found any information.

00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:38.820
Yes, a lot of people are still
learning about accessibility,

00:38:38.820 --> 00:38:43.340
and it's good they are learning,
but it's not still quite

00:38:43.340 --> 00:38:45.680
in the mainstream enough really.

00:38:46.524 --> 00:38:51.860
>> DANIELLE: Yes, our next question
is, you've answered it a bit.

00:38:51.860 --> 00:38:54.970
Do you recommend Gutenberg for
accessibility, or will people

00:38:54.970 --> 00:38:56.420
to check somewhere else?

00:38:59.170 --> 00:39:00.550
It's kind of a loaded question.

00:39:01.172 --> 00:39:02.240
>> GRAHAM: [laughs]

00:39:02.240 --> 00:39:07.800
Yes, if you are running a
website, and you're setting up

00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:12.200
a brand new website for your
company, you can certainly,

00:39:12.200 --> 00:39:15.480
just pick up like I did
one of the default themes,

00:39:15.480 --> 00:39:19.540
were press default themes,
and start using it straight away,

00:39:19.540 --> 00:39:21.640
and you can get a good output.

00:39:22.740 --> 00:39:27.280
If you stick with the core blocks,
then generally, that's pretty good.

00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:31.120
I mentioned with the tables one,
there's some limitations there

00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:32.230
as to what you can do.

00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:38.130
I didn't obviously,
do every single core block,

00:39:38.130 --> 00:39:42.040
but that's pretty good,
and you can style them how you want.

00:39:42.040 --> 00:39:47.740
Now, given its site editing rather
than content editing, I suppose

00:39:47.740 --> 00:39:53.480
if you persevered, you could
actually, end up with a good website

00:39:53.480 --> 00:39:56.450
that was fairly good from an
accessibility perspective.

00:39:56.450 --> 00:40:00.830
In the olden days, with the
classic editor you would need

00:40:00.830 --> 00:40:04.150
to get a developer like me
and like thousands of others

00:40:04.150 --> 00:40:06.670
to actually build you a theme.

00:40:06.670 --> 00:40:10.650
Then the accessibility of your
website is governed partly

00:40:10.650 --> 00:40:15.040
by your own content author
knowledge of accessibility but also

00:40:15.040 --> 00:40:18.370
how the theme developer
has put the theme together.

00:40:18.370 --> 00:40:25.610
It's quite easy to bake inaccessible
features into a WordPress theme.

00:40:25.610 --> 00:40:27.540
The default themes are
generally pretty good.

00:40:30.330 --> 00:40:37.510
I think yes it's probably not
one that you want to avoid.

00:40:37.510 --> 00:40:42.650
If you stick with the core elements,
then the chances are you're going

00:40:42.650 --> 00:40:46.190
to end up with a pretty
accessible website.

00:40:46.190 --> 00:40:49.310
>> DANIELLE: Because they're
core they're easier to extend

00:40:49.310 --> 00:40:51.600
in those different ways.

00:40:51.600 --> 00:40:55.430
We have a question about can I
put ARIA values in WordPress?

00:40:55.430 --> 00:40:58.590
I don't recall there being
a way to go that deep.

00:40:58.590 --> 00:41:02.380
I know there's a plugin that
allows you to do screen reader text

00:41:02.380 --> 00:41:03.380
and different things.

00:41:04.550 --> 00:41:08.980
I would assume that hooking into
these blocks would allow you

00:41:08.980 --> 00:41:12.620
to manipulate them and
add those ARIA values.

00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:19.280
>> GRAHAM: Then obviously you
can-- if you've got the knowledge,

00:41:19.280 --> 00:41:22.290
then you can go and
edit the code yourself.

00:41:23.480 --> 00:41:25.950
With ARIA,
I would be very cautious.

00:41:25.950 --> 00:41:30.500
I've trained a lot of people, a
lot of developers in accessibility,

00:41:30.500 --> 00:41:33.320
and I've reviewed a lot of
websites for accessibility.

00:41:33.320 --> 00:41:37.330
One of the common problems
is that people use ARIA

00:41:37.330 --> 00:41:41.360
in the wrong place,
and the wrong ARIA attributes.

00:41:41.360 --> 00:41:46.430
If you use ARIA incorrectly
it can be often a lot worse

00:41:46.430 --> 00:41:50.150
for accessibility than
just not using it at all.

00:41:50.150 --> 00:41:54.000
I'd be very, very cautious about
adding your own ARIA values.

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:58.490
Also, in the case of the old
wave way of doing an accordion,

00:41:59.850 --> 00:42:03.570
you need to tweak the values
of the ARIA attributes

00:42:03.570 --> 00:42:06.390
when the accordion opens
and when it closes.

00:42:06.390 --> 00:42:10.220
Now that's something that's done
in scripting so you'd have to get

00:42:10.220 --> 00:42:14.590
into the actual JavaScript
to actually start making sure

00:42:14.590 --> 00:42:17.090
that the ARIA has the
correct values there.

00:42:17.090 --> 00:42:19.280
That's if you know
what you're doing.

00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:20.440
Yes of course you can do it.

00:42:20.440 --> 00:42:23.600
If you don't know what you're doing,
I would caution against doing that.

00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:24.830
>> DANIELLE: Yes.

00:42:24.830 --> 00:42:29.570
I think there's that balance
between giving the users the ability

00:42:29.570 --> 00:42:31.850
to do anything in the editor.

00:42:31.850 --> 00:42:34.370
Then should we put this?

00:42:34.370 --> 00:42:34.740
[laughs]

00:42:34.740 --> 00:42:37.110
Is this the thing we should
be adding in the first place?

00:42:37.110 --> 00:42:37.720
[laughs]

00:42:37.720 --> 00:42:38.589
>> GRAHAM: Yes.

00:42:38.589 --> 00:42:41.810
With those ones with the accordions
I think it was the Kadence blocks

00:42:41.810 --> 00:42:46.880
that I looked at the accordion and
the tab panel, someone has put a lot

00:42:46.880 --> 00:42:48.660
of effort into getting that right.

00:42:48.660 --> 00:42:50.520
From an accessibility perspective.

00:42:50.520 --> 00:42:52.770
I didn't change any of
the code on that at all.

00:42:54.940 --> 00:43:00.990
The ARIA is correct and it's tweaked
by the JavaScript appropriately

00:43:00.990 --> 00:43:02.780
when the views change.

00:43:02.780 --> 00:43:06.110
Someone that he's put in some
effort in somewhere for certainly

00:43:06.110 --> 00:43:08.810
for Kadence definitely.

00:43:08.810 --> 00:43:10.870
Some of the other ones as well.

00:43:10.870 --> 00:43:14.090
Whether it was done by accident
or whether it was done on purpose

00:43:14.090 --> 00:43:15.159
in another matter.

00:43:15.159 --> 00:43:15.725
>> DANIELLE: [laughs]

00:43:15.725 --> 00:43:16.870
All right.

00:43:16.870 --> 00:43:21.250
Yes, that's obviously something
to look out for as a developer

00:43:21.250 --> 00:43:23.640
if you're looking to manipulate
those values maybe try

00:43:23.640 --> 00:43:27.800
to find some kind of plugin that
lets you do that, but still hides it

00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:29.870
from the users kind of thing.

00:43:29.870 --> 00:43:32.080
Yes, I had a question.

00:43:36.750 --> 00:43:40.050
The blocks that you showed
us, are these the ones

00:43:40.050 --> 00:43:43.710
that you would recommend
testing on any library?

00:43:43.710 --> 00:43:47.290
If some were to pop out of
nowhere, are these the ones

00:43:47.290 --> 00:43:52.230
you would recommend to get an
overall feel for how they're doing?

00:43:57.135 --> 00:43:58.150
>> GRAHAM: Perhaps, yes.

00:43:58.150 --> 00:44:00.300
I did look at a couple
of other plugins.

00:44:00.300 --> 00:44:03.620
I haven't got the notes
to hand to which ones,

00:44:03.620 --> 00:44:08.300
but the blocks I chose I
thought about all the websites

00:44:08.300 --> 00:44:12.810
that I've built for people and all
the websites that I run myself,

00:44:12.810 --> 00:44:15.760
the functionality
that I'd want to do.

00:44:15.760 --> 00:44:21.370
For example, obviously,
the simple stuff having a data table

00:44:21.370 --> 00:44:26.000
or a product comparison table I've
done that for people on a website.

00:44:27.200 --> 00:44:30.180
Having the lightbox
functionality with a gallery,

00:44:31.320 --> 00:44:34.370
if people have got lots
of pictures to show,

00:44:34.370 --> 00:44:36.190
that's a good way of doing it.

00:44:36.190 --> 00:44:40.300
To have forms obviously because
if you want to do something

00:44:40.300 --> 00:44:44.760
that's not the standard comment
on a blog form, but if you want

00:44:44.760 --> 00:44:48.240
to do a contact us form,
that's quite an important thing

00:44:48.240 --> 00:44:49.520
that you want to see.

00:44:49.520 --> 00:44:55.500
I chose the blocks to represent the
functionality I would like to see

00:44:55.500 --> 00:45:00.230
on a website and tested them then.

00:45:00.230 --> 00:45:04.210
I didn't do so much ones
that I thought were a bit--

00:45:04.210 --> 00:45:05.970
who's ever going
to use that really.

00:45:05.970 --> 00:45:06.300
>> DANIELLE: [laugh].

00:45:06.300 --> 00:45:08.470
>> GRAHAM: That's
my view obviously.

00:45:08.470 --> 00:45:11.700
Some people put a lot of
effort into these blocks,

00:45:11.700 --> 00:45:13.820
and there's probably a
good use case for them

00:45:13.820 --> 00:45:17.060
but I just chose the ones that
I thought would be the ones

00:45:17.060 --> 00:45:18.440
that I'd want to use myself.

00:45:19.610 --> 00:45:24.640
If I was picking up another
plugin-- if someone wants to say,

00:45:24.640 --> 00:45:29.270
"Graham you should be trying
the such and such block plugin."

00:45:29.270 --> 00:45:29.580
Sure.

00:45:29.580 --> 00:45:31.430
I'll give it a go and
I'll probably be looking

00:45:31.430 --> 00:45:36.980
for a similar tick list of
functionality in testing that really.

00:45:36.980 --> 00:45:39.050
Does that answer your
question, Danielle?

00:45:39.050 --> 00:45:40.010
>> DANIELLE: Yes definitely.

00:45:40.010 --> 00:45:40.390
For sure.

00:45:40.390 --> 00:45:40.920
>> GRAHAM: Good.

00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:46.480
>> DANIELLE: Overall would you
say you were pleasantly surprised

00:45:46.480 --> 00:45:49.480
about what you expected?

00:45:49.480 --> 00:45:51.100
Were you disappointed?

00:45:51.100 --> 00:45:54.050
How do you feel about
the status of both core

00:45:54.051 --> 00:45:55.910
and some of these libraries?

00:45:55.910 --> 00:45:59.890
>> GRAHAM: I think with core
there's been a lot of work done.

00:45:59.890 --> 00:46:00.890
I know.

00:46:01.680 --> 00:46:02.980
I think that was pretty good.

00:46:02.980 --> 00:46:09.680
I was expecting the simple stuff
to be okay but that was good.

00:46:09.680 --> 00:46:11.730
I was pleased about that.

00:46:11.730 --> 00:46:16.300
I was a bit picky about the table
with row headers not being able

00:46:16.300 --> 00:46:20.340
to do that with that could be added
quite easily I should imagine.

00:46:20.340 --> 00:46:27.060
The other ones, with Kadence,
I am going to mention that actually,

00:46:27.060 --> 00:46:29.620
there's been a lot of effort
put in as I mentioned before,

00:46:29.620 --> 00:46:30.620
so that's pretty good.

00:46:32.990 --> 00:46:34.060
Yes, I was quite pleased.

00:46:34.060 --> 00:46:36.570
There's good bits about all
of the ones that I featured.

00:46:36.570 --> 00:46:40.120
I don't want to go down on
any of the plugin authors

00:46:40.120 --> 00:46:43.680
or companies that I featured here.

00:46:43.680 --> 00:46:48.780
I just chose those ones because
I was asked or I chose these

00:46:48.780 --> 00:46:51.110
because of ones that
I got suggested.

00:46:52.890 --> 00:46:57.720
I think it's generally slightly
better than I expected,

00:46:57.720 --> 00:47:01.720
but I'm also not surprised,
to find that there are

00:47:01.720 --> 00:47:03.300
still some big problems.

00:47:03.300 --> 00:47:07.520
Keyboard accessibility is such
an easy thing to get right,

00:47:07.520 --> 00:47:08.620
and it's such an important thing.

00:47:08.620 --> 00:47:13.010
There's many more people,
who are keyboard-only users

00:47:13.010 --> 00:47:15.230
than there are users
of screen readers.

00:47:15.230 --> 00:47:18.170
A lot of people think
that accessibility is

00:47:18.170 --> 00:47:20.640
all about blind people
using screen readers.

00:47:21.650 --> 00:47:25.350
Yes, obviously, that's a big
thing but there are a lot

00:47:25.350 --> 00:47:27.990
of other people out there who
don't use a screen reader,

00:47:27.990 --> 00:47:29.120
but who do use a keyboard.

00:47:31.020 --> 00:47:35.550
Things like focus indication and
moving focus when a lightbox opens

00:47:35.550 --> 00:47:36.420
and stuff like that.

00:47:36.420 --> 00:47:39.570
That's the easy stuff to get right.

00:47:43.995 --> 00:47:47.010
>> DANIELLE: I think that's
it for our questions.

00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:50.240
I just wanted to say thank you.

00:47:50.240 --> 00:47:55.430
I love people testing stuff
and watching them test things.

00:47:55.430 --> 00:48:00.350
I think it's nice to look
over the shoulder of somebody

00:48:00.350 --> 00:48:04.550
and see how they test versus
how I test and I enjoy it.

00:48:04.550 --> 00:48:05.223
Thank you.

00:48:05.819 --> 00:48:07.240
>> GRAHAM: Thanks, Danielle.

00:48:07.240 --> 00:48:08.830
Yes, it is been good.

00:48:08.830 --> 00:48:10.621
Hopefully,
everyone found it useful.

00:48:10.621 --> 00:48:11.217
>> DANIELLE: Yes.

00:48:11.217 --> 00:48:11.989
Awesome.

00:48:12.840 --> 00:48:16.480

session with Graham Armfield.
