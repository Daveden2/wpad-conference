00:00:00.054 --> 00:00:31.932
[silence]

00:00:31.932 --> 00:00:33.140
>> AMBER HINDS: Hello.

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.300
Welcome to WordPress
Accessibility Day.

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.280
My name is Amber Hinds.

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:42.920
I am one of the lead organizers for
the event and I'm really excited

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:49.130
to introduce you all to our keynote
speaker today, Nicolas Steenhout.

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:57.910
Nic has been a developer since
the mid-'90s and was approached

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:01.590
at that point in time by clients
facing issues that were not yet part

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.530
of the public consciousness.

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.330
In that early time, accessibility
hurdles were really keeping people

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.300
with disabilities from engaging
with the technical revolution

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:18.840
and that is what motivated him to get
involved with website accessibility.

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.060
He transitioned into the nonprofit
sector where he collaborated

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.380
with people in a wide variety of
impairments and was introduced

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.480
to new assistive technologies.

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:33.380
Now, 25 years later, Nic is working
as an independent consultant both

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.880
for private and nonprofit
businesses and organizations.

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.630
He is a blogger, a podcaster,
and a public speaker.

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.640
We are very excited to have
him here today for his Keynote:

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.690
Open Source and accessibility:
Do it with us, not for us.

00:01:56.984 --> 00:01:57.781
>> NICOLAS STEENHOUT: Hi, everyone.

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.200
Thank you for the intro, Amber.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.580
I am Nic Steenhout.

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:07.260
I'm so super excited to open the
WordPress Accessibility Day 2022.

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:13.230
It's so awesome to see events
related to WordPress talking

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.850
and educating about accessibility
because WordPress is big.

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:19.470
We all know that.

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:24.400
The other big thing is the number
of disabled people in the world.

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.210
I'll talk about the numbers
game in a bit, but first,

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:31.600
a little bit more about
me that Amber was saying.

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.790
I've been working in digital
accessibility one way or another

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.350
for a very long time.

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:42.330
I remember when the alt
attribute was introduced to HTML.

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:47.700
Trivia time, this was in 1993.

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.070
It's quite a while back.

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:54.470
When I was doing websites.

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.340
I was not really thinking about
accessibility at the time,

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:04.620
but I had a bit of an Aha moment
and it came in three moments.

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.000
The first one was talking to
a colleague, he was blind.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.040
He came into my office one day,
he was so frustrated, he says,

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.010
"Make this website."

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.100
The only thing I hear is
image, image, image.

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:21.470
Then I looked at the site and
I realized what we were doing

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:23.960
at the time because
CSS was not a thing.

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:29.160
To have really nice fonts
we would take image of text

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:34.190
and cut them out and then
present that as our menu

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:36.920
or as our main text even.

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.150
We didn't put in alt text
and suddenly I realized,

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:44.550
"Oh, this is a problem for someone
who's blind using a screen reader."

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:47.994
It looks good,
but it's basically nonexistent

00:03:47.994 --> 00:03:49.280
for assistive technologies.

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:56.020
The second moment, about two
weeks later, was a deaf colleague.

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:58.650
She came into my
office and she said,

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:04.680
"Nic, I can't install this printer
because the instructions are

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:09.520
on a CD with a video,
no text, and no captions."

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:14.490
I had to help setting up the printer
because the instructions were not

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:15.810
in an accessible format.

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:23.550
Then the third time within again,
just a few more weeks later was

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:28.850
one of our consumer came in and
she says, "I would love to be able

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:33.790
to use the web,
but everything is distracting me.

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:38.510
All the colors, all the blinking
things, the text moving,

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:43.480
the large font, the underline,
everything is so distracting

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:44.970
that I can't use it."

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:48.570
I started looking,
how do we do this?

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:54.890
I created basically a CSS
reset before that was a thing

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:58.010
for this person with ADHD.

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:03.810
These three events, one after the
other, really cemented the importance

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:06.130
of digital accessibility.

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:08.880
As a wheelchair user,
I was already aware of

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:12.200
how important physical
accessibility was

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:16.320
and these three people
really brought it home to me.

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:24.420
These days I mostly provide
consultation for large companies.

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:26.990
They aim to improve their
product accessibility.

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:35.110
I've also done a lot of
work around open source,

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:38.700
including using WordPress as a
developer and as an end user.

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:45.000
I've been on the W3CA Accessibility
Initiative, the education,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.970
and outreach working group.

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:52.370
I've worked with and on open-source
applications for a long time

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:56.960
and now I prefer to provide
accessibility training.

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:01.220
I speak about visibility, inclusion,
and obviously accessibility

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:02.690
at tech events like this one.

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:07.590
Though today my presentation
is not a tech talk

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:12.930
because accessibility is not
about tech, it's about people.

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:17.180
That's my main motive
today, my main message,

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:19.970
and that's what I'm
going to talk about.

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:24.490
First though,
I want to do some housekeeping.

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:31.610
You can grab the slides, they're
online from bit.ly/a11y-day-wp.

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:44.270
You can follow along if you want
that way, these slides are going

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:47.290
to stay up after the presentation,
there's no rush to get there.

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:52.670
Then I need to let you know,
my slides are mostly just there

00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:55.470
to give you something
to look at if you want.

00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:59.260
I'm not going to read my slides,
but I will speak to everything

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:00.260
that's on them.

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:04.520
You're not missing anything
by me not reading the slides.

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:08.960
Most of the images on the
slides, they're just eye candy

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:12.390
and I'll make sure to describe
the images that really matter.

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:18.680
Finally, this is not
just me talking at you.

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:22.470
Obviously, it's hard in a keynote
format to have a dialogue,

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:25.790
but I really do want to
have a dialogue with you.

00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:28.290
At the end of the
talk, let's have that.

00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:32.950
Take notes during my presentation
and bring up any perspective you want

00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:37.460
to bring up because this
is not going to happen

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:41.980
without a collective agreement,
without a collective effort,

00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:44.910
and that's just not going
to happen without dialogue.

00:07:44.910 --> 00:07:45.930
Keep that in mind.

00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:51.560
At the end, we're hopefully going to
have a bit of a really good dialogue.

00:07:56.390 --> 00:08:01.570
There's so many ways free
open-source software, FOS OS.

00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:03.750
Open-source software
has changed the world.

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:08.840
For example, most of the world's
supercomputers, they run Linux,

00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:10.730
the Cloud runs Linux.

00:08:10.730 --> 00:08:14.740
Android is technically at
least, open source.

00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:15.540
The list goes on.

00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:17.450
I'm not going to talk
about all these things.

00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:23.520
The thing is, open source has been
beneficial for individuals as well.

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:26.650
For example, having your own
presence on the web is so much easier

00:08:26.650 --> 00:08:30.400
for people when you use
open-source software like WordPress

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:33.610
or many other content
management systems.

00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:37.700
This has been super
important for so many people.

00:08:46.830 --> 00:08:49.560
Open-source software has problems.

00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:54.910
It has problems in a lot of ways
that I'm not going to explore

00:08:54.910 --> 00:08:59.850
but it has a big
problem in relation to

00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:05.020
what I'm talking about is disability
and accessibility and inclusion.

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:10.530
FOS projects really reflect
society in many ways.

00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:14.130
As a result,
we have systemic ableism in place

00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:17.500
and I'm hoping this talk will
help you confront that reality.

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:23.060
I'm hoping to give you some ideas
on how you can make changes.

00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:25.204
By attending this
conference I'm pretty sure

00:09:25.204 --> 00:09:27.067
you're already interested.

00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:28.990
Let's talk about numbers.

00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:35.830
One of the questions I'm
often asked by clients

00:09:35.830 --> 00:09:40.890
or by open-source project folks is
how many disabled people are there?

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:46.060
I think the real question
they want to ask is more like,

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:51.520
"Is it worth for us to spend time
and resources on accessibility?"

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:56.590
I tell them I don't like
to play the numbers game.

00:09:56.590 --> 00:09:59.190
I don't like the game because
it's not about numbers.

00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:04.530
If we really want to play the
numbers game, okay, let's ask this,

00:10:04.530 --> 00:10:09.330
what's the oldest browser you
support and what's the percentage

00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:11.160
of visits you get
from that browser?

00:10:12.210 --> 00:10:17.430
I'm willing to bet that number will
be smaller than the hard number

00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:19.940
of disabled people we
can get from census data.

00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:26.490
There's anywhere between
15% and 26% of people

00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:30.450
that have a disability depending
on the data you're looking at.

00:10:30.450 --> 00:10:33.440
That's a significant
difference from 15 to 26.

00:10:34.810 --> 00:10:38.410
Let's say in our context,
not everyone who is counted

00:10:38.410 --> 00:10:41.320
as disabled has
barriers on the web.

00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:44.300
We have to remove
some of those numbers.

00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:48.280
You have to shave off folks that
don't experience barriers on the web.

00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:54.420
Then to that number,
you have to add folks

00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:56.590
that have temporary impairments.

00:10:56.590 --> 00:10:59.160
Like me when I broke
both my wrists.

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:02.760
That wasn't counted in the
census data or maybe people

00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:05.000
that have brain fog
from Long COVID.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:06.230
That's a thing, right?

00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:09.820
It's a very important thing
that's coming to our consciousness

00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:15.290
as developers or maybe they're
fighting tiredness after a big lunch,

00:11:15.290 --> 00:11:18.800
or maybe they got stung by a bee
in the face and they can't see

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:19.650
from one eye.

00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:23.600
There's any number
of reasons why people

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:25.810
without permanent disabilities,

00:11:25.810 --> 00:11:28.720
permanent impairments
will need accessibility.

00:11:29.770 --> 00:11:36.940
We're evening out that number 15% to
26% plus a whole bunch of numbers.

00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:40.090
Then you also have to
add all these peoples

00:11:40.090 --> 00:11:45.630
who have disabled loved ones and the
able-bodied allies and accomplices.

00:11:45.630 --> 00:11:49.420
These people who care
about accessibility

00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:52.870
and who will make a decision
about your product, your service,

00:11:52.870 --> 00:11:57.250
your website, based on how accessible
it is for their loved ones.

00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:03.020
The numbers game is rather
enablers, there's no clear answers

00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:07.360
beyond the numbers don't
matter, if you don't want

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:12.240
to exclude people these
numbers are pointless.

00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:16.310
Ultimately, it doesn't matter if
you exclude one person, 100 people,

00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:17.730
or even 100,000 people.

00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:22.540
A community that excludes even
one of its community members

00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:24.830
is no community at all.

00:12:29.110 --> 00:12:33.100
That's a message I was pushing hard
when I started getting involved

00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:34.930
in open source.

00:12:34.930 --> 00:12:38.330
I became active on
the Mambo CMS forum.

00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:42.720
Mambo was one of the first
content management systems I used,

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:45.308
and I was super vocal
about accessibility

00:12:45.309 --> 00:12:46.910
on the Mambo user forums.

00:12:46.910 --> 00:12:49.720
Those of you who know me
know that that's what I do.

00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:52.700
If I see a problem, I speak out.

00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:56.970
If I see some things well
done, I also speak out,

00:12:56.970 --> 00:13:00.970
but for several months I
was really active there and,

00:13:00.970 --> 00:13:04.340
talking about accessibility in
the forums, helping people out

00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:05.170
with the forums.

00:13:05.170 --> 00:13:11.320
Then the entire core team
decided to fork the project.

00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:14.690
They didn't like what
was happening with Mambo.

00:13:14.690 --> 00:13:16.640
They thought it wasn't open enough.

00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:18.840
They forked the project
and they form, what we now

00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:23.800
know as Joomla I realize
we have someone talking

00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:26.540
about Joomla line
accessibility later today.

00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:31.830
I'm super excited for that because
I want to see where it's at now

00:13:31.830 --> 00:13:35.400
because when Joomla began,
they asked me to come on board

00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:37.560
and help make Joomla accessible.

00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:40.740
Of course, I jumped at the chance,
hey, I was getting involved

00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:44.541
in the forums and I
was a bit frustrated

00:13:44.542 --> 00:13:47.600
to not see things really happen.

00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:50.910
I became involved and
my experience was not

00:13:50.910 --> 00:13:56.620
as great as I was
hoping at the time.

00:13:56.620 --> 00:13:59.660
I was able to get a number of
small improvement included,

00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:03.020
but after 18 months or
so, I quit the team.

00:14:04.630 --> 00:14:07.450
Accessibility at the
time was going nowhere,

00:14:07.450 --> 00:14:10.750
and I was done hitting my
head against a brick wall.

00:14:10.750 --> 00:14:15.720
It was very difficult and
there was so much work.

00:14:17.130 --> 00:14:21.880
The admin interface, that needed
to be completely redone in a way

00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:27.390
that was accessible, but that
was just way too big of an idea.

00:14:28.940 --> 00:14:31.470
Let's face it, we had too much work

00:14:31.471 --> 00:14:34.620
to just make the front end
accessible. Forget the backend.

00:14:35.670 --> 00:14:40.540
I spent a lot of time to refactor
the code as a proof of concept

00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:45.420
as to what we could do to make
sites render WCAG Conformant

00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:49.380
front ends web content
accessibility guidelines.

00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:53.930
At the time we were working on
version one of the guidelines.

00:14:57.710 --> 00:14:59.510
My changes were not included.

00:15:01.130 --> 00:15:05.340
I spent quite a bit of time
refactoring the entire code base,

00:15:06.690 --> 00:15:10.280
and they just weren't included.

00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:14.660
In fact, some core team members
started saying things like,

00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:17.408
"Hey, why don't we
leave accessibility

00:15:17.409 --> 00:15:19.170
to third-party plugins?"

00:15:19.170 --> 00:15:21.880
At the time,
one line of code overlay solutions,

00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:25.220
which I'll talk about
later, these didn't exist.

00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:30.960
The suggestion was literally the
idea of someone building an add-on

00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:34.380
to override non-accessible
aspects of Joomla.

00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:39.340
The team all believed that
accessibility was important.

00:15:39.340 --> 00:15:43.930
There's no doubt about that,
but there was a strong stench of,

00:15:43.930 --> 00:15:45.140
"Not our job."

00:15:46.250 --> 00:15:48.360
That was the end for me.

00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:53.100
It reflected how little the team
actually understood the importance

00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:54.810
of accessibility.

00:15:54.810 --> 00:15:59.220
Even though I'd been educating
and advocating for year and a half

00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:04.450
and all the previous
time on the Mambo forum.

00:16:04.450 --> 00:16:06.540
It took a while to
get to that point.

00:16:16.070 --> 00:16:20.750
Now, jumping to a different topic
from content management system

00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:22.890
to learning management system.

00:16:23.910 --> 00:16:27.980
A couple of years ago I was
looking for an accessible LMS.

00:16:29.450 --> 00:16:33.780
I reached out to the top 50
learning management system providers

00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:34.170
out there.

00:16:34.170 --> 00:16:38.870
It took some digging, it took
some time, but I created a list

00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:44.300
of the most likely
top 50 LMS providers.

00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:46.480
Some were open-source,
some were commercial.

00:16:48.090 --> 00:16:52.740
The commercial offerings
were almost amusing.

00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:56.220
They were mostly frustrating,
but it was so frustrating.

00:16:56.220 --> 00:16:58.300
It was quite amusing.

00:16:58.300 --> 00:17:05.420
For example, one of them quoted
me a cost of nearly $50,000

00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:11.820
just for one year, and they said,
"We have a near 100% conformance

00:17:11.820 --> 00:17:15.970
to WCAG 1.2 AA."

00:17:15.970 --> 00:17:23.540
Yes, they were promising WCAG
1.2, I queried and they confirmed.

00:17:24.580 --> 00:17:27.540
The thing is, for those of
you that aren't familiar

00:17:27.540 --> 00:17:31.580
with the accessibility guidelines,
there never was a WCAG 1.2.

00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:36.300
We had WCAG 1 for nearly 10 years.

00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:38.400
Then we got WCAG 2.

00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:47.450
Then next went on to the
next provider that was saying

00:17:47.450 --> 00:17:49.370
that they were accessible.

00:17:50.510 --> 00:17:52.490
They were very expensive.

00:17:52.490 --> 00:17:56.900
When I asked them to give me
some very specific information

00:17:56.900 --> 00:18:00.850
about how accessible they were
and maybe provide the art,

00:18:02.610 --> 00:18:05.150
they told me that information
about accessibility

00:18:05.150 --> 00:18:09.350
was commercially sensitive and they
weren't going to share it with me.

00:18:11.490 --> 00:18:15.410
They say they're accessible,
but the actual level

00:18:15.410 --> 00:18:18.420
of accessibility is
a commercial secret.

00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:23.030
That really did not work for me.

00:18:23.030 --> 00:18:26.066
That led me, of course,
to have another look

00:18:26.066 --> 00:18:27.173
at open-source offerings.

00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:29.330
There was Moodle.

00:18:29.330 --> 00:18:30.710
Moodle is known everywhere.

00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:33.770
It's the first open-source
LMS to offer accessibility.

00:18:34.890 --> 00:18:38.540
It's a bear to work with
for admins and the last time

00:18:38.540 --> 00:18:41.760
I had a good look it really
was so server intensive.

00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:44.610
It just was an option
for this client.

00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:51.550
Then we have open edX,
which seems to also be a bear,

00:18:51.550 --> 00:18:57.380
and it requires knowledge of the
platform to use and documentation,

00:18:57.380 --> 00:19:00.870
at least at the time I was
looking, was seriously lacking.

00:19:00.870 --> 00:19:03.330
It really wasn't an option.

00:19:03.330 --> 00:19:07.270
We had to look at hiring
an open edX specialist,

00:19:07.270 --> 00:19:08.720
which wasn't really the idea.

00:19:10.390 --> 00:19:16.470
Eventually, we settled on
WordPress, a WordPress solution

00:19:16.470 --> 00:19:19.140
with WooCommerce and Sensei LMS.

00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:23.680
Only it wasn't accessible
out of the box,

00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:27.980
but never fear it's open
source so we could fix it.

00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:30.450
I started hacking the files
to make it accessible.

00:19:32.620 --> 00:19:38.270
I was looking on Sensei developer
forums, and there was a discussion

00:19:38.270 --> 00:19:43.610
to go from what they were doing to
using the WordPress blog system.

00:19:43.610 --> 00:19:46.110
Of course, it makes sense
to use the blog system

00:19:46.110 --> 00:19:51.670
because that's the direction
WordPress was taking, but I gave up.

00:19:51.670 --> 00:19:58.990
I gave up in trying to hack
and remediate and fix Sensei

00:19:58.990 --> 00:20:03.390
because by the time I'd have
finished refactoring Sensei to work,

00:20:03.390 --> 00:20:07.360
ostensibly, it would be a
completely different system,

00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:09.450
and all the work I would
have done would have

00:20:09.450 --> 00:20:12.290
to be have been
done all over again.

00:20:12.290 --> 00:20:16.170
Unless, of course, everything
would have been put into Sensei,

00:20:16.170 --> 00:20:20.200
but that's a whole
different level of work.

00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:25.880
It really means also, one of the
problems I have with open-source,

00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:31.210
which is often individuals like
you and I are putting a lot of time

00:20:31.210 --> 00:20:39.800
and a lot of work in making a product
better that is a commercial product.

00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:43.680
It's making a profit for
other people than the ones

00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:45.170
that are putting the hard work.

00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:48.890
While I've done that,
for a long time, I've come

00:20:48.890 --> 00:20:53.710
to realize this is not me, but I
digress this is in different things.

00:20:53.710 --> 00:20:59.300
Anyway, the developers were
open to integrating my changes,

00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:04.170
but the feeling I got was that it
was going to be me against the world.

00:21:04.170 --> 00:21:06.590
I would have to justify
every single change.

00:21:06.590 --> 00:21:11.090
Why do we make this happen,
and maybe it was going to be included

00:21:11.090 --> 00:21:15.630
and maybe not,
and why should I bother?

00:21:15.630 --> 00:21:19.620
Really, I had better things to do
with my time than to spend hours

00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:24.130
and days and possibly
weeks fixings accessibility

00:21:24.130 --> 00:21:28.510
of an open-source project
for commercial goals.

00:21:28.510 --> 00:21:34.280
Of course, my prior experience with
Joomla really soured me on the idea.

00:21:36.130 --> 00:21:40.410
That said, the rest of my
presentation, I'm really going

00:21:40.410 --> 00:21:43.500
to push the idea of disabled
people getting involved.

00:21:45.410 --> 00:21:50.360
Keep that idea of my frustration
and my reluctance to involve myself

00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:54.490
in open source development
so much these days.

00:21:54.490 --> 00:21:59.260
Keep that on the side,
because it's not so important.

00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:05.590
I forgot my slide about learning
management systems, there you go.

00:22:09.580 --> 00:22:12.280
It's a good time to
bring up ableism.

00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:14.230
What's ableism?

00:22:14.230 --> 00:22:15.890
It's something you
may have heard about.

00:22:17.750 --> 00:22:19.450
There's many ways to define that.

00:22:19.450 --> 00:22:22.230
A simple definition I
really like goes like this.

00:22:23.650 --> 00:22:29.000
Ableism is discrimination,
or prejudice against disabled people,

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:30.380
intentional or not.

00:22:31.550 --> 00:22:35.950
We're talking prejudice and bias
and outright discrimination.

00:22:35.950 --> 00:22:39.920
We're talking about actions,
and we're talking about language,

00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:41.770
we're talking about policies.

00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:46.420
Ableism can be active or passive.

00:22:46.420 --> 00:22:49.970
Some things you do are ableist,
not doing some other things

00:22:49.970 --> 00:22:53.150
is also ableist,
and we don't have to look far

00:22:53.150 --> 00:22:55.440
to find an example of ableism.

00:22:55.440 --> 00:23:01.210
For example, I was speaking at a
conference just before the pandemic,

00:23:01.210 --> 00:23:04.750
and the Chief Technical Officer
of a company was surprised

00:23:04.750 --> 00:23:08.110
to hear that blind
people use computers.

00:23:08.110 --> 00:23:12.590
They said, "Oh, you're saying
that's why alt text matters

00:23:12.590 --> 00:23:15.550
but then they also dismissed the
need for it on their platform.

00:23:15.550 --> 00:23:18.220
They said, "We don't have
any blind people coming here

00:23:18.220 --> 00:23:21.300
from our website,
because while they don't use it."

00:23:22.660 --> 00:23:25.390
Of course, as I said earlier,
we don't really have metrics

00:23:25.390 --> 00:23:28.870
about how many disabled people
actually use our website.

00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:34.940
Ableism is also a company
thinking the information

00:23:34.940 --> 00:23:39.660
about their product accessibility
is sensitive commercial information,

00:23:39.660 --> 00:23:41.270
and then not sharing
it with clients.

00:23:44.110 --> 00:23:46.180
Ableism goes into the language.

00:23:46.180 --> 00:23:49.190
When was the last time you heard
someone say, "That's crazy?"

00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:55.680
By using the word crazy to
denote a negative aspect,

00:23:55.680 --> 00:24:00.000
and because that word is so closely
associated with mental illnesses

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:04.400
when the expression is used the
implication is that mental illnesses

00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:09.930
are negative, even if the person
using that expression did not mean it

00:24:09.930 --> 00:24:10.930
that way.

00:24:12.510 --> 00:24:16.500
Because the intent, in most
cases, isn't anywhere near

00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:19.080
as important as to
how it's received.

00:24:21.780 --> 00:24:25.970
Let's face it, hearing ableist
language isn't anywhere near

00:24:25.970 --> 00:24:28.840
as problematic as being
unable to see your doctor

00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:30.920
because their booking
website isn't accessible.

00:24:32.710 --> 00:24:36.100
If you experience ableism,
even the small stuff

00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:39.510
if you experienced that often
enough, it becomes difficult.

00:24:40.550 --> 00:24:44.560
A friend recently compared
it to a death by 1,000 cuts.

00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:49.120
Each time is a microaggression, and
each experience builds upon the next

00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:51.640
and the next and the
previous one and it becomes

00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:54.650
this super uncomfortable
experience.

00:24:54.650 --> 00:25:02.790
It's not nice, and maybe you'll
say, "That's nice,

00:25:02.790 --> 00:25:07.932
but what's that got
to do with WordPress?"

00:25:07.933 --> 00:25:11.495
Ableism is often
ingrained in each of us

00:25:11.496 --> 00:25:16.100
because the society we live
in, we are our projects,

00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:18.410
we reflect our organization.

00:25:18.410 --> 00:25:23.790
We influence our work, and it takes
a lot of work to go beyond ableism.

00:25:25.490 --> 00:25:29.110
Ableism is systemic and
our projects are system,

00:25:29.110 --> 00:25:32.020
our organizations are system.

00:25:32.020 --> 00:25:35.820
Unless we systematically go
through our policies, our practice,

00:25:35.820 --> 00:25:41.200
our workflows, we will continue to
have ableism influence our actions,

00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:42.930
whether we know it or not.

00:25:44.230 --> 00:25:46.950
Ableism is a societal problem.

00:25:46.950 --> 00:25:49.020
Ableism is a human problem.

00:25:52.130 --> 00:25:55.700
Accessibility is a solution
to a human problem.

00:25:55.700 --> 00:26:01.120
Now, take note, I am not saying
that disabled people cause problems,

00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:07.960
that's not at all what I'm
saying, but we disable our users.

00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:12.030
We use tech in ways that cause
problems for disabled folks.

00:26:13.250 --> 00:26:16.790
What we should be doing instead is
using tech to eliminate barriers

00:26:16.790 --> 00:26:17.960
for disabled humans.

00:26:22.220 --> 00:26:26.480
We can't keep thinking of
accessibility as a tech issue.

00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:29.350
The tech is the tool
no more no less.

00:26:29.350 --> 00:26:33.390
We work in tech, but at least those
of you attending this conference

00:26:33.390 --> 00:26:36.570
has a strong interest in
using tech to create stuff.

00:26:38.270 --> 00:26:44.190
Let's use the tools to provide
accessibility, to improve access.

00:26:44.190 --> 00:26:47.760
Fixing bad markup is the result
of accessibility work, yes.

00:26:48.810 --> 00:26:52.350
Markup being bad is not the
reason we need to fix that markup.

00:26:52.350 --> 00:26:55.500
It's not the sole
reason to do that.

00:26:55.500 --> 00:27:00.640
We need to fix it because of the
barriers we created for people

00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:02.390
when we have bad markup.

00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:07.380
Maybe that's a deceptively
simple idea because it goes

00:27:07.380 --> 00:27:13.020
to a complete paradigm shift
I'm asking you to go from,

00:27:15.210 --> 00:27:19.300
we're going to change
this thing because we need

00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:25.600
to make it better to, we're going
to completely change our thinking

00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:30.560
about accessibility in our
project, and from there, it's going

00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:34.070
to get things easier to fix.

00:27:34.070 --> 00:27:38.330
I'm going to ask you to create
a culture of accessibility

00:27:38.330 --> 00:27:42.820
that accounts for and
aims to eliminate ableism.

00:27:44.470 --> 00:27:49.240
Now, I'm going to take you back
to my Joomla days for a moment

00:27:49.240 --> 00:27:53.810
because it ties in with the idea
of a culture of accessibility.

00:27:53.810 --> 00:27:56.670
From the slide I have here for
those of you who can't see it,

00:27:56.670 --> 00:28:04.070
I think is really quite
good, if I may say so.

00:28:04.070 --> 00:28:08.310
It's a dance troupe,
there's four people on the stage.

00:28:08.310 --> 00:28:11.530
There's two men and two
women, one of the women

00:28:11.530 --> 00:28:17.780
is a power wheelchair user, and
there's a struggle between the woman

00:28:17.780 --> 00:28:21.570
in the wheelchair and a man
who's pushing against her hand.

00:28:21.570 --> 00:28:24.620
The whole thing is very
fluid, very dynamic.

00:28:24.620 --> 00:28:30.610
To me, it's really this
representation of a fight

00:28:30.610 --> 00:28:33.930
of disabled people
trying to get included,

00:28:33.930 --> 00:28:39.450
trying to be part of society.

00:28:42.310 --> 00:28:46.660
I just really liked that
image, that dance.

00:28:46.660 --> 00:28:50.660
Anyway, culture of accessibility.

00:28:52.250 --> 00:28:55.080
I realized what I'd failed
to implement when I was

00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:57.440
at Joomla was a culture
of accessibility.

00:28:58.850 --> 00:29:04.080
You see, I realized, in retrospect, I
had approached things the wrong way.

00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:08.260
I had approached things in
terms of let's fix code,

00:29:08.260 --> 00:29:12.180
I advocated for specific
changes in the interface.

00:29:12.180 --> 00:29:16.480
Sure, I spoke about disabled
folks and how we use the web,

00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:18.710
but I didn't lead with that.

00:29:18.710 --> 00:29:21.870
I didn't try and change
the culture first.

00:29:21.870 --> 00:29:23.643
I don't know that I
would have succeeded

00:29:23.644 --> 00:29:25.070
if I had approached it that way.

00:29:26.430 --> 00:29:31.560
My thinking these days
is that once the culture

00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:35.960
of accessibility is
solid, changing code

00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:39.470
or changing design practices
is a relatively mundane thing.

00:29:40.550 --> 00:29:44.740
It's mundane because people know
how important accessibility is,

00:29:46.020 --> 00:29:49.350
and there are resources
targeting accessibility.

00:29:49.350 --> 00:29:52.970
Teams integrate thinking about
accessibility from the start.

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:58.670
Accessibility becomes a matter
of fact, rather than a big ordeal

00:29:58.670 --> 00:30:01.050
that takes a long time
and costs a lot of money.

00:30:02.230 --> 00:30:09.510
Designers start to think about their
design in ways that is accessible.

00:30:09.510 --> 00:30:11.610
They don't even have to
really think about it.

00:30:11.610 --> 00:30:16.680
They don't have to say, ''Is
this going to comply with WCAG?''

00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:20.690
No, because they've built that
muscle, that design muscle

00:30:20.690 --> 00:30:23.950
that integrates their
understanding of accessibility.

00:30:23.950 --> 00:30:26.020
It's the same thing for developers.

00:30:26.020 --> 00:30:29.840
Developers don't have to think,
''oh, is what I'm doing going

00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:34.580
to be accessible?'' They've
built that muscle memory,

00:30:34.580 --> 00:30:39.460
that understanding, just like they
know JavaScript or they know PHP,

00:30:39.460 --> 00:30:42.830
or they know HTML
hopefully they know HTML.

00:30:42.830 --> 00:30:45.960
Just like they know their
programming language,

00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:51.400
accessibility becomes an aspect,
a skill, part of their skill set.

00:30:54.030 --> 00:30:55.630
Same thing with QA.

00:30:55.630 --> 00:31:01.350
QA people, they don't just run
automated testing, they understand

00:31:01.350 --> 00:31:04.460
that they have to do manual
testing and functional testing,

00:31:04.460 --> 00:31:07.720
and they can't rely just
on automated testing.

00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:13.070
All that good stuff that all
these people like me are doing,

00:31:13.070 --> 00:31:16.120
accessibility consulting,
advocating for accessibility,

00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:20.080
all these things we've been
pushing for, it all flows

00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:22.400
from a culture of accessibility.

00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:27.270
Once we have that, then we
don't have all these problems.

00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:32.050
Now, you may have
heard this analogy,

00:31:32.050 --> 00:31:35.070
"Accessibility is like
a blueberry muffin."

00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:39.260
If you try to stuff the blueberries
in the muffin after they're baked,

00:31:39.260 --> 00:31:42.810
it's going to make a mess
and it's going to fail.

00:31:42.810 --> 00:31:46.180
If you put the berries in the
batter before you bake them,

00:31:46.180 --> 00:31:50.840
it takes no time and the results
are good at no extra cost.

00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:54.250
That's where a culture
of accessibility helps.

00:31:54.250 --> 00:31:58.290
We become better at adding
the ingredients and the recipe

00:31:58.290 --> 00:32:02.350
at the correct time, and we don't
have to think about it so much.

00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:09.920
The culture of accessibility
also leads me to say something

00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:12.080
maybe quite controversial.

00:32:12.080 --> 00:32:14.600
Accessibility is good for everyone.

00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:15.150
Yes.

00:32:15.150 --> 00:32:17.590
I said I stand by it.

00:32:17.590 --> 00:32:20.720
It's actually controversial
because in some sectors

00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:24.090
of the disability communities,
some advocates are saying

00:32:24.090 --> 00:32:28.380
that it raises the
disability experience.

00:32:28.380 --> 00:32:32.600
For example, they claim that by
suggesting plain language benefits

00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:34.810
non-native speakers.

00:32:34.810 --> 00:32:37.820
We erase the need of folks
with cognitive impairments.

00:32:37.820 --> 00:32:42.470
For example, your website is in
English and I'm going to tell you

00:32:42.470 --> 00:32:47.550
if you use plain language,
Chinese visitors, Spanish visitors,

00:32:47.550 --> 00:32:51.330
French visitors are going to have an
easier time understanding your site.

00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:58.080
By making that argument
some advocates are saying,

00:32:58.080 --> 00:33:02.810
we erase the need of folks
with cognitive impairments.

00:33:02.810 --> 00:33:06.150
If I use an example from
the built environment,

00:33:06.150 --> 00:33:09.140
they're saying that suggesting
curb cuts are good for parents

00:33:09.140 --> 00:33:13.890
with strollers erases the
experience of wheelchair users.

00:33:13.890 --> 00:33:16.580
I, also a wheelchair user
myself, I don't get it.

00:33:17.910 --> 00:33:22.190
I'm raised a lot less by having
a curb cut that I can use,

00:33:22.190 --> 00:33:25.210
even if it's been added to
help parents with strollers

00:33:25.210 --> 00:33:28.050
or definitely folks with
dollies or kids on skateboards.

00:33:29.250 --> 00:33:33.330
I'm raised a lot more than if
there's no curb cut at all.

00:33:34.690 --> 00:33:38.140
For me, I'm going to use
every tool in the arsenal,

00:33:38.140 --> 00:33:42.140
and I am going to say
accessibility is good for everyone.

00:33:42.140 --> 00:33:50.370
I am going to say, having a culture
of accessibility really includes

00:33:50.370 --> 00:33:52.860
that because we're
talking about inclusion,

00:33:52.860 --> 00:33:59.140
we're talking about everybody, but
of course, we have to keep disability

00:33:59.140 --> 00:34:01.710
at the forefront of
our mind absolutely.

00:34:01.710 --> 00:34:04.750
That's a primary aspect of
digital accessibility work.

00:34:06.350 --> 00:34:11.150
Frankly, I will be happy if the
end result is a platform or website

00:34:11.150 --> 00:34:12.500
or an app that's accessible.

00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:18.040
What if the decision-makers needed
to realize that good contrast

00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:21.690
is important for folks using
their app on a cell phone,

00:34:21.690 --> 00:34:25.900
in full sun because my friends
with low vision, they'll be able

00:34:25.900 --> 00:34:27.740
to use the site when
the contrast is good.

00:34:28.790 --> 00:34:33.760
The thing is, this goes hand in
hand with having a solid culture

00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:34.940
of accessibility, doesn't it?

00:34:42.620 --> 00:34:48.080
Margaret Staples, a developer
advocate said during our keynote

00:34:48.080 --> 00:34:52.670
at Midwest PhD a few years ago,
that your community is you.

00:34:55.010 --> 00:34:59.480
Open Source Software is often
community-based and a lot

00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:03.260
of projects rely on the
community to get things done.

00:35:03.260 --> 00:35:07.250
That's both wonderful and
really demanding of you,

00:35:07.250 --> 00:35:11.440
demanding of your time,
your energy, your resources.

00:35:12.810 --> 00:35:15.440
It's important to realize
that you have a chance

00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:19.560
to start making this change
toward an organizational culture

00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:20.970
of accessibility.

00:35:20.970 --> 00:35:23.780
You have the power because
you are the community.

00:35:26.190 --> 00:35:30.290
Maybe your power will be limited
until the culture is changed,

00:35:30.290 --> 00:35:32.230
but every little bit helps.

00:35:32.230 --> 00:35:34.170
You have to shift that paradigm.

00:35:36.530 --> 00:35:40.540
As I say that, I'm well aware
that we have decisions to make.

00:35:40.540 --> 00:35:44.380
I chose not to get involved
with remediating Sensei LMS.

00:35:45.450 --> 00:35:49.010
We can't fix all the things
all the time, but we can start

00:35:49.010 --> 00:35:50.520
on little things.

00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:53.790
We can pick the projects that
are really important to us,

00:35:58.670 --> 00:36:03.570
In those projects,
we need accessibility champions.

00:36:04.870 --> 00:36:07.857
That's what really open
source projects needs

00:36:07.858 --> 00:36:09.740
are accessibility champions.

00:36:09.740 --> 00:36:12.160
What do I mean by an
accessibility champion?

00:36:13.250 --> 00:36:17.180
To me, an accessibility champion
is someone who's got an interest

00:36:17.180 --> 00:36:18.750
in making things more accessible.

00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:24.380
It's someone who has at least a
basic understanding of accessibility.

00:36:24.380 --> 00:36:28.230
It's also someone who's okay
with being the squeaky wheel.

00:36:28.230 --> 00:36:30.370
Someone who will raise
their hand and say,

00:36:30.370 --> 00:36:35.620
''Hey, what about accessibility?''
Obviously, we need a few experts.

00:36:35.620 --> 00:36:38.080
The experts are going to
be there with understanding

00:36:38.080 --> 00:36:39.490
the technical challenges.

00:36:39.490 --> 00:36:42.830
The experts are going
to provide solutions

00:36:42.830 --> 00:36:48.430
but champions might not know
the subtle differences between

00:36:48.430 --> 00:36:52.290
how voiceover renders something
compares to Jazz, and they

00:36:52.290 --> 00:36:54.596
might not be able to
tell if those difference

00:36:54.597 --> 00:36:56.000
are even actually important

00:36:57.280 --> 00:37:01.150
but champions will know that it's
important to ensure something works

00:37:01.150 --> 00:37:02.520
for screen reader users.

00:37:04.540 --> 00:37:08.590
Self-aware champions will also
know where their knowledge ends

00:37:08.590 --> 00:37:12.250
and is getting stretched and when
it's time to call in experts.

00:37:14.190 --> 00:37:19.420
Every team should have at least one
accessibility champion on board.

00:37:20.740 --> 00:37:25.030
If you don't have that as
a team leader, find someone

00:37:25.030 --> 00:37:30.500
that's interested,
find someone who has an interest.

00:37:30.500 --> 00:37:33.370
Going back to the numbers
game, there's probably one

00:37:33.370 --> 00:37:37.920
in four disabled
people in the world.

00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:41.740
That means that maybe someone
has a disability you don't know

00:37:41.740 --> 00:37:43.140
or you haven't seen.

00:37:43.140 --> 00:37:46.910
Maybe you don't want to ask
that because you don't want

00:37:46.910 --> 00:37:51.230
to force people to disclose obviously
but maybe if you put it out there.

00:37:51.230 --> 00:37:54.160
You have a team and you
say, ''We have a team,

00:37:54.160 --> 00:37:57.430
we don't have a champion that's
really versed in accessibility

00:37:57.430 --> 00:38:01.580
that's taking that too
hard, who wants to be it?''

00:38:02.810 --> 00:38:06.790
That's what you can do if
you're not that person who wants

00:38:06.790 --> 00:38:08.590
to be an accessibility champion.

00:38:08.590 --> 00:38:12.000
Although if you're sitting
on this conference today,

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:15.710
you probably are the accessibility
champion for your team,

00:38:15.710 --> 00:38:18.720
and that's not a problem for
you to have at this point.

00:38:24.490 --> 00:38:29.520
I going back one slide because
I'm going ahead of myself.

00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:36.410
Lack of champions on teams can
lead organizations thinking

00:38:36.410 --> 00:38:40.620
that accessibility overlays are
a good solution to accessibility.

00:38:42.700 --> 00:38:45.060
Chances are if you're
attending today's conference,

00:38:45.060 --> 00:38:48.300
you know better than
that, but maybe not.

00:38:48.300 --> 00:38:52.190
Because I'm seeing
accessibility overlays coming

00:38:52.190 --> 00:38:55.010
into the WordPress ecosystem.

00:38:55.010 --> 00:38:58.840
I've heard a lot of people
talk about these solutions

00:38:58.840 --> 00:39:03.720
and I really should point out that
the plugin repository maintainers

00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:05.950
don't have a lot of
control over that.

00:39:08.760 --> 00:39:13.450
By overlays,
I mean plugins that typically use AI

00:39:13.450 --> 00:39:16.440
to supposedly fix
accessibility on a side.

00:39:16.440 --> 00:39:19.040
Either you install a plugin on
your site or you add one line

00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:21.670
of code that calls a
bunch of JavaScript,

00:39:21.670 --> 00:39:26.070
then you supposedly get all your
accessibility problem solved.

00:39:26.070 --> 00:39:30.530
As a bonus, you give the appearance
of giving disabled user a choice

00:39:30.530 --> 00:39:32.800
as to how they will be
interacting with your site

00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:33.990
through a nifty little widget.

00:39:35.790 --> 00:39:42.810
Some of the overlays I've heard
about recently include Hive or Pojo.

00:39:43.910 --> 00:39:48.290
Even better, when I googled WordPress
Accessibility Day this morning,

00:39:48.290 --> 00:39:52.860
the first two sponsored results
were for overlay companies.

00:39:52.860 --> 00:39:55.500
I won't name them because they're
quick to call in their lawyers

00:39:55.500 --> 00:39:59.600
when they think someone talks badly
about them, but there's others.

00:40:02.100 --> 00:40:06.790
These overlays present
themselves as user options,

00:40:06.790 --> 00:40:11.640
but they typically conflict with
actual user-assistive technology.

00:40:11.640 --> 00:40:15.500
Why should you need to optimize
a site for keyboard-only users

00:40:15.500 --> 00:40:18.500
by using a widget when you can
build a site that works well

00:40:18.500 --> 00:40:19.500
out of the box?

00:40:20.770 --> 00:40:21.870
That kind of stuff.

00:40:21.870 --> 00:40:26.370
I'm going to be clear here,
I have to do to say this

00:40:26.370 --> 00:40:28.400
because I believe firmly in it.

00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:32.740
One line of code, automated
accessibility fixes are not ready

00:40:32.740 --> 00:40:34.710
for prime time,
maybe they'll never be ready.

00:40:36.190 --> 00:40:37.450
Anyway, there you have it.

00:40:37.450 --> 00:40:40.990
If you're on a team, on a project
that is considering using an overlay

00:40:40.990 --> 00:40:45.420
or an accessibility widget,
you can do a lot of good by saying,

00:40:45.420 --> 00:40:46.990
"No, let's not do that."

00:40:48.260 --> 00:40:53.950
Anyway, disabled people are the
obvious accessibility champion.

00:40:53.950 --> 00:40:57.950
On this slide, I have a photo
of the late Stella Young,

00:40:57.950 --> 00:41:03.590
a wonderful accessibility advocate
who did a great talk at TEDx

00:41:03.590 --> 00:41:06.810
about inspiration porn.

00:41:06.810 --> 00:41:10.720
If you don't know that,
I encourage you to go look it up

00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:11.720
because it's great.

00:41:13.710 --> 00:41:17.820
I was glad to see there's many
disabled presenters, organizers today

00:41:17.820 --> 00:41:19.550
at this conference.

00:41:19.550 --> 00:41:21.710
Maybe not all
disabilities are visible,

00:41:21.710 --> 00:41:25.780
but obviously disabled folks
have a keen interest in things

00:41:25.780 --> 00:41:26.780
being accessible.

00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:34.560
Disabled people are often called
on to be accessibility champion,

00:41:34.560 --> 00:41:39.350
but we can get tired,
we're now frustrated, burned out.

00:41:39.350 --> 00:41:42.100
Think about my Joomla experience.

00:41:42.100 --> 00:41:42.940
Let's face it.

00:41:42.940 --> 00:41:46.850
Also, sometimes we want to do
stuff that's not directly related

00:41:46.850 --> 00:41:52.130
to accessibility, and too many
projects expect disabled people

00:41:52.130 --> 00:41:53.660
to help with accessibility.

00:41:54.900 --> 00:41:56.906
I had a developer who once tweet,

00:41:56.907 --> 00:41:59.460
"Hey, are there blind
screenreader users

00:41:59.460 --> 00:42:01.180
that want to help with my project?"

00:42:01.180 --> 00:42:02.940
There was no money in it.

00:42:02.940 --> 00:42:09.080
There was nothing other than I'm
going to use your time to tell me

00:42:09.080 --> 00:42:11.980
if my site works or not without
having done the background.

00:42:13.120 --> 00:42:17.060
Too few projects are willing to
pay disabled people for their time,

00:42:17.060 --> 00:42:20.440
and by pay, I don't just mean
money, I'm talking about pay

00:42:20.440 --> 00:42:26.060
with respect, pay with actual
changes, pay with listening to us.

00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:33.880
Now, accessibility champions
shouldn't just be disabled people

00:42:33.880 --> 00:42:35.230
on a project.

00:42:35.230 --> 00:42:39.340
Yes, we want to be involved when
the circumstances are right,

00:42:39.340 --> 00:42:42.020
but we're not enough
of us to go around.

00:42:42.020 --> 00:42:46.030
We have a lot of people that are
disabled, but there's none of us

00:42:46.030 --> 00:42:49.530
to go and participate
in all these projects.

00:42:50.670 --> 00:42:53.840
Beyond champions, we need allies.

00:42:53.840 --> 00:42:58.180
I know many non-disabled folks
working in accessibility, good folks,

00:42:58.180 --> 00:43:01.120
allies, accomplices,
champions, and experts.

00:43:01.120 --> 00:43:06.460
To those non-disabled folks watching
the presentation, thank you.

00:43:06.460 --> 00:43:08.500
Thank you for being
interested in accessibility.

00:43:08.500 --> 00:43:10.430
Thank you for your work.

00:43:10.430 --> 00:43:14.490
To the disabled folks watching,
let's make sure to give them a chance

00:43:14.490 --> 00:43:15.610
to be good allies.

00:43:17.930 --> 00:43:21.900
Also, let's remember that
being disabled doesn't make you

00:43:21.900 --> 00:43:25.120
an accessibility
expert, necessarily.

00:43:25.120 --> 00:43:28.470
Being disabled makes you an
expert on your own experience

00:43:28.470 --> 00:43:30.810
of disability and accessibility.

00:43:30.810 --> 00:43:34.540
In some ways, being disabled
makes you the super expert

00:43:34.540 --> 00:43:38.410
on your own experience, and your
voice is very important for that.

00:43:40.820 --> 00:43:43.430
Unless you make an effort
to learn about other aspects

00:43:43.430 --> 00:43:45.920
of accessibility,
you can't be an expert.

00:43:45.920 --> 00:43:49.350
Unless you work hard at
it, you can't be an expert.

00:43:49.350 --> 00:43:53.910
I'm going to plug in my podcast
here, the accessibility soundbite

00:43:53.910 --> 00:43:57.570
because I want disabled people to
share the barriers they experience

00:43:57.570 --> 00:43:59.230
on the web for all of us to learn.

00:43:59.230 --> 00:44:01.350
For all the champions out
there to pay attention

00:44:01.350 --> 00:44:05.700
to all the little things that even
the experts can be expected to know.

00:44:10.420 --> 00:44:13.530
I often repeat the model,
nothing about us without us,

00:44:13.530 --> 00:44:17.650
don't enact accessibility without
talking to disabled people.

00:44:17.650 --> 00:44:20.860
There's a related saying
that is also very important,

00:44:20.860 --> 00:44:23.340
do it with us, not for us.

00:44:23.340 --> 00:44:26.390
If you implement accessibility
for disabled people,

00:44:26.390 --> 00:44:29.090
you're likely approaching
accessibility from a perspective

00:44:29.090 --> 00:44:31.890
of either charity
or legal compliance,

00:44:31.890 --> 00:44:33.840
and that's not the
frame of mind you want.

00:44:33.840 --> 00:44:37.170
It's also not the frame of mind
you have when your organization

00:44:37.170 --> 00:44:39.460
or your project has a
culture of accessibility.

00:44:41.550 --> 00:44:46.430
I'm coming short on time,
I'm going to skip a couple of things

00:44:47.930 --> 00:44:50.350
that I invite you to look at later.

00:44:55.850 --> 00:45:01.990
I'm going to reach my conclusion,
yes, I think I can do that.

00:45:01.990 --> 00:45:05.970
I'm going to say,
together we can make change happen,

00:45:05.970 --> 00:45:09.250
disabled folks, experts,
champions, designers, developers,

00:45:09.250 --> 00:45:12.030
stakeholders,
we really can make change.

00:45:13.680 --> 00:45:16.750
I've been accused of being
naive by some people.

00:45:16.750 --> 00:45:20.080
I've been told by other
people that I'm optimistic,

00:45:20.080 --> 00:45:23.900
and I've banged my head against
a brick wall a time or three.

00:45:23.900 --> 00:45:27.440
I've gotten frustrated,
I've gotten burned out, you name it.

00:45:27.440 --> 00:45:33.630
Yet I still believe that together
disabled and non-disabled,

00:45:33.630 --> 00:45:37.830
experts and champions, organization
leaders and line workers,

00:45:37.830 --> 00:45:42.360
project founders, and community
together we can make change happen.

00:45:43.970 --> 00:45:49.180
I'm going to leave this docket
with a challenge for you.

00:45:49.180 --> 00:45:52.890
What are you going to do to
move the organization forward?

00:45:54.850 --> 00:46:00.170
What is one thing, just one thing
that you're going to do this week

00:46:00.170 --> 00:46:01.710
to move that needle?

00:46:01.710 --> 00:46:05.370
When you've done that, what's the
next month that you're going to do?

00:46:08.160 --> 00:46:11.970
That's me, I invite you to reach
out on Twitter later because,

00:46:11.970 --> 00:46:14.310
typically,
there's questions that pop into mind

00:46:14.310 --> 00:46:17.590
that you haven't really thought
about until after the talk,

00:46:17.590 --> 00:46:20.490
and these things have sifted.

00:46:20.490 --> 00:46:24.830
I'm going to have a quick look at the
questions that are coming through.

00:46:28.719 --> 00:46:29.450
>> AMBER: That was great.

00:46:29.450 --> 00:46:30.810
Thank you so much, Nic.

00:46:30.810 --> 00:46:33.310
I think we only are going to
have time for one question,

00:46:33.310 --> 00:46:35.840
but we'll see how quickly
we can move through them.

00:46:35.840 --> 00:46:38.770
The first question was someone
wanted to know, how can somebody

00:46:38.770 --> 00:46:41.970
who wants to be a champion
of accessibility get started?

00:46:41.970 --> 00:46:44.780
Not knowing what's important
how do you start learning enough

00:46:44.780 --> 00:46:45.930
to be effective?

00:46:46.904 --> 00:46:48.590
>> NIC: That's a
fantastic question.

00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:52.980
I'm going to circle back to
listen to the disabled experience.

00:46:54.190 --> 00:46:58.130
Obviously, you can have trouble
finding disabled people,

00:46:58.130 --> 00:47:00.720
but if you listen to my
podcast, for example, it's going

00:47:00.720 --> 00:47:03.820
to be one thing that you're
going to hear the experience

00:47:03.820 --> 00:47:05.910
of disability in their own words.

00:47:05.910 --> 00:47:16.033
There is the W3C-- [sound cut]

00:47:16.033 --> 00:47:20.450
>> AMBER: Whoop, I think that
we may have lost Nic, maybe not.

00:47:20.450 --> 00:47:21.550
>> NIC: Have you lost me?

00:47:21.550 --> 00:47:22.150
Am I here?

00:47:22.150 --> 00:47:23.607
>> AMBER: Yes, you're back now.

00:47:25.600 --> 00:47:29.120
>> NIC: I was saying my
podcasts and the W3C website

00:47:29.120 --> 00:47:36.860
at w3.org/wui is a great central
resource to start learning

00:47:36.860 --> 00:47:41.550
about things and where
to be more effective.

00:47:43.060 --> 00:47:46.690
>> AMBER: I think to just
generally engaging and probably

00:47:46.690 --> 00:47:49.080
being willing to speak up even
if you don't know everything

00:47:49.080 --> 00:47:53.270
because you need that differentiation
between experts and advocates,

00:47:53.270 --> 00:47:53.640
right?

00:47:53.640 --> 00:47:54.180
>> NIC: Yes.

00:47:54.180 --> 00:47:55.439
>> AMBER: Or champions.

00:47:56.190 --> 00:47:58.720
One other question
that might be quick.

00:47:58.720 --> 00:48:02.160
The question is those
accessibility overlays shouldn't be

00:48:02.160 --> 00:48:04.830
the complete solution to
an accessible website,

00:48:04.830 --> 00:48:10.530
but to be fully WCAG 2.1 AAA
compliant, aren't they required?

00:48:11.641 --> 00:48:15.000
>> NIC: Absolutely, not.

00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:20.380
Don't even think about overlays,
overlays are not a solutionverlays

00:48:20.380 --> 00:48:25.030
are a barrier to accessibility,
overlay providers are evil.

00:48:25.030 --> 00:48:30.500
I don't care if they sue
me, I and over 700

00:48:30.500 --> 00:48:33.540
accessibility expert
disability experts have signed

00:48:33.540 --> 00:48:38.260
the overlay fact sheets, the segment
position, it's not a good thing.

00:48:38.260 --> 00:48:44.280
No website can ever be WCAG AAA
compliant, it's just not possible.

00:48:44.280 --> 00:48:47.010
It's a goal to aspire
to, but it doesn't work.

00:48:47.010 --> 00:48:54.350
You can be WCAG 2.1 AA compliant,
and you do not need any overlays

00:48:54.350 --> 00:48:54.820
to do that.

00:48:56.435 --> 00:48:57.420
>> AMBER: Great.

00:48:57.420 --> 00:48:58.200
Thank you so much.

00:48:58.200 --> 00:49:03.700
We will have a talk later on
about overlays, and whether

00:49:03.700 --> 00:49:06.200
or not they can actually live up
to their heights definitely tune in

00:49:06.200 --> 00:49:07.200
for that.

00:49:07.950 --> 00:49:11.090
That's about as much time as
we have for questions today.

00:49:11.090 --> 00:49:14.630
Please feel free to follow up
with Nic either on Twitter,

00:49:14.630 --> 00:49:16.810

or in the WordPress Accessibility
Day's Slack as well.

00:49:21.370 --> 00:49:24.650
>> NIC: My Twitter handle for
those who can't read the slide

00:49:28.866 --> 00:49:29.280
>> AMBER: Thank you.

00:49:29.280 --> 00:49:30.300
>> NIC: Thanks, everyone.

00:49:31.035 --> 00:49:33.080
>> AMBER: Thank you everyone
