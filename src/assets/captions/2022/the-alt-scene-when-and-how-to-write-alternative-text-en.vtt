00:00:31.404 --> 00:00:32.142
>> CARRIE DILLS: Hey there.

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:35.620
Welcome to WordPress
Accessibility Today.

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.560
My name is Carrie Dills and I'm
a freelance WordPress developer

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:40.060
and instructor.

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:42.940
Thank you for joining
us for The Alt Scene:

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:48.250
When and How to Write Alternative
Text, with Meg "Memi" Miller.

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.385
They're the lead developer
and accessibility specialist

00:00:51.385 --> 00:00:52.786
for AccessiCart.

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.960
Growing up building computers and
gaining tech has been a major part

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.860
of their life since childhood.

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:00.960
Having grown up with
a disabled sister,

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.980
they found themselves also drawn
to others with disabilities

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:05.460
throughout life.

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.720
Web accessibility is not a trend
or a fear of a lawsuit for Memi,

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.070
but a logical collision
of two life-long passions.

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.530
They will continue to fight, learn,
educate, and aggressively nag

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.900
until website accessibility
becomes an industry standard.

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.910
Please feel free to add your
questions in the Q&A tab in Slido,

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:28.310
and we'll answer them at
the end of the session.

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.560
You can use the ideas section
to chat with other attendees.

00:01:36.618 --> 00:01:37.507
Welcome, Memi.

00:01:37.881 --> 00:01:38.906
>> MEG MILLER: Hi.

00:01:43.593 --> 00:01:44.610
Okay, there we go.

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.280
What an amazing lineup
we've had today.

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.670
I'm really,
really happy to be here.

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:56.460
Welcome to The Alt Scene: When and
How to Write Good Alternative Text.

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.840
Regardless of what stage of your
accessibility journey you're on,

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.390
alt text will play a consistent
role from websites to social media,

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.850
emails, and social apps
like Discord and Slack.

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.190
Alt texts plays a huge role in
ensuring your content is accessible

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.860
to everyone, but there's a difference
between just writing alt text

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.640
and writing good alt text.

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.150
You'll have a better [inaudible]

00:02:19.151 --> 00:02:24.499
of the [inaudible]

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:28.730
As Carrie already said,
I'm Meg "Memi" Miller.

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.519
What she didn't mention
is I have five animals,

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:33.590
three of which are cats.

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.150
You'll probably see one
jumping up here trying

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:38.600
to help me advance my slides.

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.570
The other thing is,
I have to be honest with you guys,

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:45.940
I have been on the precipice
of a migraine all week,

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.570
so I apologize in advance if
it takes me a little bit longer

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:53.860
to refocus on my presentation
here, but let's get started.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.380
What is alternative or alt text?

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:06.120
On a semantic level, alt text is
the manual description of an image.

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.530
This tells automated software
like screenwriter users

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.810
and search engine crawlers
what the image depicts.

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:15.290
Sometimes,
alt text is pretty simple,

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.870
and other times it can be a little
bit more complex and open-ended.

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.250
For example, I intentionally chose
a mini comic here to illustrate

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.640
just how open-ended it can be.

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:30.090
I have my all text for this comic
up on the screen here, which says,

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.370
A four-panel comic: captions
read, "I'm always getting stuck

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:36.200
in my head, so I'm trying to
make it a nice place to be,"

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.430
credit: worry lines.

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:42.370
Art description: A person's head
with a space and smaller version

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.100
of themself drawn in the empty
head space, (their head-self).

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:49.780
In the first panel,
the person has a neutral expression.

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:52.563
The head-self starts getting
gradually more comfortable

00:03:52.564 --> 00:03:56.690
in the space until they're snuggled
up reading a book in the final panel.

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:59.180
The person is smiling
pleasantly in the final panel.

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:03.800
I went for an overall
description of the comic.

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:07.470
However, effective alt text could
be a panel by panel description.

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:10.810
I also feel it's important in
many cases, similar to this,

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:14.340
to present the text first
and describe the image after.

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:17.730
This is a really lengthy
chunk of alt text.

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:21.000
While this method doesn't provide
as much suspense or anticipation,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.940
it allows a screen reader
user to decide if they want

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.380
to hear the description
of the image or move on

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:28.360
after they've obtained
the actual information.

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:33.020
This is an example of alt text
is just as much of a reflection

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:37.990
of the writer as the
image they've chosen is.

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:40.590
Why is alt text so important?

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:43.110
If an image is worth a thousand
words, why is it important

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:46.390
to still try and describe that
image in less than 200 characters?

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:50.933
First and foremost,
alt text describes an image

00:04:50.934 --> 00:04:52.520
to screen reader users.

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:56.820
While we are going to focus primarily
on users who are visually impaired,

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:59.710
a broad variety of people
use screen readers.

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:02.970
Some users with cognitive, learning,
and motor disabilities, for example.

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:06.140
When a screen reader
lands on an image,

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:09.420
the alt text will be read out loud
to them, which provides context

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:10.420
to those users.

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:15.070
It's also important for search
engine optimization or SEO.

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:17.540
Search engine crawlers index
image through their alt text

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:20.460
and categorize it as
additional content relative

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:22.580
to the information
presented on the page.

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:26.870
If there were two websites
with identical information down

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:31.530
to the word, but one of them
had alt text and one didn't,

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:34.210
the one with alt text would
rank higher in search engines

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:36.960
because it would be considered to
have more content than the other.

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:41.450
Alt text can also be
useful circumstantially.

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:44.890
There could be any number of reasons
a webpage won't load properly,

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:47.350
like a slower internet connection,
or occasionally landing

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:50.190
on a website at the exact time
a server backup is running.

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:53.810
When images won't load,
you may see that little icon

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:55.430
with the text next to it.

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:57.140
That's the alt text.

00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:59.758
Alt text can still be
circumstantially beneficial

00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:03.380
for any user who simply happens to
land on your site at the wrong time.

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:10.730
The ultimate purpose of alt text
is to provide the same context

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:14.950
to a visually impaired user as
an image would a sighted user.

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:18.430
Imagine listening to a
baseball game on the radio,

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:21.540
remember the radio,
but instead of describing the game,

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:24.680
Harry Caray just sat
silently for three hours.

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:27.760
Finally, at the end he says,
"The Cubs just won the World Series.

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:28.760
Thanks for tuning in."

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:31.770
Would you feel robbed
of the experience?

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:37.090
Would you have the ability to imagine
every inning in perfect detail,

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:46.130
or would you prefer Harry's
enthusiastic play by plays,

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:48.770
whose energy would reflect the
mood of stadium every minute

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:50.520
of the game making you
feel like you were there?

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:55.630
Alt text is to website assets as
sports broadcasters are to games,

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:57.620
and that same purpose
should be reflected.

00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:01.430
I also feel like alt text is
a good opportunity for you

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:02.690
to judge your own content.

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:07.720
A good example, anyone who knows
me knows I struggle to ramble.

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:11.200
A while back, I was trying out a new
art program and made a quick comic.

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:14.070
I uploaded it to Twitter and
realized 1 million different ways

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:17.710
I could have worded the comic
better and made it more accessible

00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:21.950
as I maxed out Twitter's 1,000
character alt text limit.

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:23.850
If you find yourself
struggling with your alt text,

00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:26.020
it could be a good opportunity
for you to ask yourself

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:29.400
that the assets you're using
are relevant to your content,

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:33.160
or if you did the best job possible
when creating your own media.

00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:38.690
Now, let's talk about
what alt text isn't for.

00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:42.491
Alt text is not a place
to embed keywords or tags

00:07:42.492 --> 00:07:43.770
into your poster page.

00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:45.390
I still see this all the time.

00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:48.420
As people are more familiar
with the concept of SEO,

00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:51.390
content creators are looking
for every possible opportunity

00:07:51.390 --> 00:07:53.450
to pump the ratings.

00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:55.080
Alt text is not the
place to do that.

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:57.650
It has an actual purpose.

00:07:57.650 --> 00:08:00.740
As accessibility has become
more and more in demand,

00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:05.790
this practice can actually lower your
accessibility or your SEO ranking.

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:10.530
It's also not a good excuse to
continue putting words in images,

00:08:10.530 --> 00:08:13.130
but we will elaborate on
that a little bit more later.

00:08:14.290 --> 00:08:18.060
Alt text is also not an excuse
to provide additional content

00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:20.200
that sighted users wouldn't have.

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:24.750
This includes important information,
image credits, or irrelevant jokes.

00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:27.700
I see this a lot,
especially on social media.

00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:30.250
Someone will have a group
photo and add something silly

00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:34.190
and snarky that isn't actually
relevant to the image,

00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:36.960
and it's often passive aggressive
statements like, "Good thing so

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:37.960
and so wasn't there."

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:42.590
It's one thing be funny or
creative with your alt text

00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:46.510
if it's relevant to the image,
but it really defeats the purpose

00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:48.410
if you're treating it like
your middle school diary.

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:54.980
As web accessibility is still
being figured out, there are a lot

00:08:54.980 --> 00:08:58.200
of standards that are still up
in the air, and that's okay.

00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:01.170
After all, those who benefit
from accessibility are humans

00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:03.880
who have different opinions
and thought processes.

00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:06.840
In my opinion,
I don't think things like alt text

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:10.060
can be universally standardized
because we're not creating websites

00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:11.470
for robots.

00:09:11.470 --> 00:09:15.000
These are my Text myth opinions,
some of which you may not agree with,

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.300
or have heard contradicting
instructions for.

00:09:18.830 --> 00:09:21.810
Myth one: Alt text should
always be objective

00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:24.560
and avoid making interpretations.

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:26.360
I believe there's a time
and a place for both.

00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:31.370
Objective alt text should
revolve around products and data.

00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:35.020
This is when you don't want to
influence your user's thinking.

00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:38.940
You shouldn't be trying to set
a mood when describing data

00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:42.210
or a product, but describing it
objectively and allow your users

00:09:42.210 --> 00:09:43.890
to come to their own conclusions.

00:09:45.130 --> 00:09:49.730
Subjective options are things
like paintings, food and animals.

00:09:49.730 --> 00:09:52.220
These photos are usually
intended to evoke a feeling,

00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:55.030
and it will depend on the alt
text to reinforce that to someone

00:09:55.030 --> 00:09:57.240
who can't see the image.

00:09:57.240 --> 00:10:00.120
If you're running a food blog
and have a photo of a taco,

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:03.170
you're probably going to want to
emphasize how delicious it looks

00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:04.810
because that's the
purpose of that photo.

00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:09.880
Animals are highly subjective and
used for a variety of purposes.

00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:11.790
If you're writing an article
about your cat, then yes,

00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:16.660
you may want to state in your alt
text, "My super adorable cat."

00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:17.500
That is subjective.

00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:20.060
I know it's hard to believe, but
not everybody thinks cats are cute.

00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:23.220
I'm not one of those people
but I know they're out there.

00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:27.190
Alternatively, if you're writing
an article on animal abuse

00:10:27.190 --> 00:10:30.700
and you're using an image of a dog
leaning up against a kennel wall,

00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:33.730
then you'll probably use more
subjective language, like sadly,

00:10:33.730 --> 00:10:35.810
to emphasize the
intention of this photo.

00:10:37.630 --> 00:10:39.620
Myth number two,
everybody's favorite.

00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:43.166
Blind people aren't my
company's demographics,

00:10:43.167 --> 00:10:44.490
so we don't need alt text.

00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:49.520
Every accessibility specialist
out there has heard this before,

00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:51.760
and it's extremely lazy.

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:54.140
One, as we've already
stated, more than just those

00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:59.090
who are blind use screen readers,
but for the sake of this argument,

00:10:59.090 --> 00:11:00.300
let's discuss blindness.

00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:04.920
Two, there's not a
consistent analytical way

00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:09.010
to detect screen reader usage or
how it's being used on a website.

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:12.240
Three,
it's extremely short-sighted.

00:11:14.030 --> 00:11:17.410
Let's talk about a completely
hypothetical company

00:11:17.410 --> 00:11:18.646
with a loyal demographic

00:11:18.647 --> 00:11:20.860
of absolutely no
visually impaired users.

00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:25.240
Somehow, not even a single
person wears glasses or contacts.

00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:32.300
One of them tomorrow gets
into an accident or falls ill,

00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:38.330
or turns 30, and now suddenly their
vision is permanently affected.

00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:42.230
They still want to spend
money on your website

00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:44.640
but you haven't set it up
for them to be able to.

00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:48.650
The demographic
argument is never valid.

00:11:48.650 --> 00:11:52.180
If there are people out there
who are blind and hunting,

00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:55.530
and there are, with adaptive
scopes, then I'm sure there

00:11:55.530 --> 00:11:58.180
are visually impaired users trying
to buy your basketball shorts

00:11:58.180 --> 00:11:59.940
or exotic coffee beans.

00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:05.500
Myth three: Alt
text takes too long.

00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:10.170
Despite this talk practically being
an amateur creative writing course,

00:12:10.170 --> 00:12:12.710
all text does not
need to be that hard.

00:12:12.710 --> 00:12:18.020
Sometimes it's as easy
as yellow chopstick.

00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:20.720
That's a super easy one,
but you know what I mean.

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:22.770
It doesn't have to be that hard.

00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:28.870
Myth four: Every single
image requires alt text.

00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:31.500
Decorative images do
not require alt text,

00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:33.140
but we will talk about that later.

00:12:34.610 --> 00:12:37.480
Myth five: You shouldn't
include descriptions

00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:40.280
only non-visually impaired people
will understand, like color.

00:12:41.450 --> 00:12:44.520
This hot take is probably
one of the most contested.

00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:46.560
Personally,
I don't think people should shy away

00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:48.070
from mentioning
something like color.

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:52.100
It still adds to a
user's mental picture.

00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:55.180
While describing something like
color may not add or take away

00:12:55.180 --> 00:12:58.740
from the experience of a user
who has been blind since birth,

00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:00.950
it could potentially add
to the experience of a user

00:13:00.950 --> 00:13:03.100
who was sighted for a
period of their life

00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:07.860
or who's still partially sighted,
and provide additional context

00:13:09.190 --> 00:13:11.980
for any user who utilizes alt text.

00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:15.660
I do realize this is a contested
topic, so this may be something you

00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:17.840
might have to decide what you're
comfortable with yourself.

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:23.400
Myth six: You never need alt
text if you have a caption

00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:27.670
in your photo,
or if your photo has a caption.

00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:31.340
Captions and alt text generally
have different purposes.

00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:33.960
If your caption is actually
describing the image, then no,

00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:35.480
you don't need alt text.

00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:37.640
That would be redundant.

00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:40.430
However, image captions
are generally cutesy like,

00:13:40.430 --> 00:13:43.120
"Beach day, date night, yay."

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:45.960
That does not effectively
describe an image.

00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:48.970
Whether it's on your
website or on social media,

00:13:48.970 --> 00:13:52.100
your images will more often
than not require alt text.

00:13:55.090 --> 00:13:58.220
On this slide is an array
of polaroid-esque images

00:13:58.220 --> 00:14:00.520
that are completely blank
with little strips of tape

00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:01.580
on some of their corners.

00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:07.990
As I've mentioned, I don't think alt
text universal standards are written

00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:09.020
in stone.

00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:12.020
However, there are some generally
agreed upon best practices.

00:14:14.670 --> 00:14:19.360
Avoid starting off your alt text
with a picture of or an image of.

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:22.960
Since screen readers
announce what the element is

00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:29.330
in my graphic element,
this is repetitive.

00:14:29.330 --> 00:14:33.000
There are exceptions to this when
you're describing the medium though,

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:37.110
like comic, painting, digital art.

00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:38.620
This provides context.

00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:44.270
Use proper grammar, spelling,
and simple language-

00:14:44.270 --> 00:14:47.960
oh, I mixed those up-
and avoid acronyms.

00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:53.220
This is all about creating effective
description and descriptive alt text.

00:14:53.220 --> 00:14:56.260
For example, if a screen
reader user hops to an image

00:14:56.260 --> 00:15:00.210
and an acronym hasn't been
defined yet, you can leave a user

00:15:00.210 --> 00:15:02.920
with more questions than answers.

00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:05.772
Alt text should be all
about answering questions

00:15:05.772 --> 00:15:07.770
and not creating more.

00:15:07.770 --> 00:15:10.980
Think of the image as an
independent entity, and also try

00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:13.720
to avoid special characters
like "ever since".

00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:15.910
These practices will
ensure screen reader users

00:15:15.910 --> 00:15:19.830
and search engine crawlers identify
the image as accurately as possible.

00:15:22.050 --> 00:15:24.430
Try to avoid one-word alt text.

00:15:24.430 --> 00:15:26.910
It is rarely descriptive enough.

00:15:26.910 --> 00:15:31.290
There are some cases like icons,
a one-word alt text description

00:15:31.290 --> 00:15:33.930
could be sufficient,
but almost never when we're talking

00:15:33.930 --> 00:15:36.230
about an actual image or photo.

00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:37.760
This also doesn't help your SEO.

00:15:40.890 --> 00:15:44.130
The ideal length of alt
text is 125 characters.

00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:48.970
The character count actually
changes all the time.

00:15:48.970 --> 00:15:52.370
Anytime you Google ideal
character count, it changes,

00:15:52.370 --> 00:15:54.980
shifts all the time,
but there's always going

00:15:54.980 --> 00:15:57.910
to be unavoidable
exceptions to this.

00:15:57.910 --> 00:16:01.680
A more complex image may
require more alt text.

00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:04.020
The important thing
is to keep it in mind,

00:16:04.020 --> 00:16:06.380
be considered of people's
time, and try to stick

00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:08.410
to what is most important
about the image.

00:16:10.010 --> 00:16:12.550
There will always be
exceptions to this.

00:16:12.550 --> 00:16:15.840
For example, NASA has been releasing
new images of the solar system

00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:18.800
from the James Webb
Space Telescope.

00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:21.590
They've diligently been
adding alt text to each photo,

00:16:21.590 --> 00:16:25.640
and their character counts
average 5 to 700 characters.

00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:28.910
If their social media manager was
terrified of going into detail

00:16:28.910 --> 00:16:32.240
because they'd go over 125
characters while describing space,

00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:36.530
screen reader users would
miss out on that experience.

00:16:37.550 --> 00:16:40.390
Some images just demand more
descriptions than others.

00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:45.780
When do you add alt text?

00:16:45.780 --> 00:16:48.450
The short answer is almost
every time you use an image.

00:16:48.450 --> 00:16:51.930
However, decorative images
do not require alt text.

00:16:53.310 --> 00:16:56.550
One of the biggest accessibility
loopholes I see people trying

00:16:56.550 --> 00:17:01.490
to create is, technically, aren't
all images descriptive or decorative?

00:17:01.490 --> 00:17:02.490
No, they're not.

00:17:03.490 --> 00:17:06.450
People use images for a reason.

00:17:06.450 --> 00:17:10.480
They add context, evoke a feeling,
and sometimes give instructions.

00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:14.570
These are not decorations but
content, and that content needs

00:17:14.570 --> 00:17:17.930
to have a description that
would provide the same context

00:17:17.930 --> 00:17:20.050
to a visually impaired user
as it would a sighted user.

00:17:21.530 --> 00:17:24.040
I have two examples
up on the screen.

00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:27.450
A non-decorative image
and a decorative image.

00:17:27.450 --> 00:17:32.960
My non-decorative image is
of that of a cat [inaudible]

00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:33.960
looking at the fourth wall.

00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:36.770
Pretty cute.

00:17:36.770 --> 00:17:39.720
Using this image would create
cozy sense of curiosity

00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:42.900
on someone's personal blog,
or provide a warmer aesthetic

00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:44.710
to a shelter site.

00:17:44.710 --> 00:17:47.600
This image is intended to
add something to the site.

00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:49.620
It needs alt text.

00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:53.190
Additionally, an image like
this would probably be relevant

00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:56.380
to the blog's content, either
of the page or the entire blog,

00:17:56.380 --> 00:17:58.750
so the alt text would
benefit the site's SEO.

00:18:00.750 --> 00:18:02.650
In my decorative column,
I have a fleur-de-lis.

00:18:02.650 --> 00:18:06.300
This is a decorative object
probably used in a background

00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:08.270
or a small accent somewhere.

00:18:08.270 --> 00:18:13.280
Something like this, or a
pattern, swirls, background images

00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:16.380
that aren't necessarily
intended to be seen at all, like

00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:20.290
with a really dark overlay,
this would be considered decorative

00:18:20.290 --> 00:18:23.360
and not require alt text unless
it was actually being used

00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:24.630
for a specific purpose.

00:18:25.670 --> 00:18:28.880
For example, my fleur-de-lis in my
slides actually does have alt texts

00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:32.760
because I'm intentionally
using it for this purpose.

00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:36.480
My little sparkle graphics that
I have in the top of my slides,

00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:39.750
they don't have alt text
because they're decorative.

00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:44.650
The purpose of making an image
decorative either on your website

00:18:44.650 --> 00:18:48.750
or a document,
or PowerPoint slides is

00:18:48.750 --> 00:18:52.090
to not waste a screen reader's
time with superfluous image

00:18:52.090 --> 00:19:00.430
or graphics because that
isn't relevant to the content,

00:19:01.790 --> 00:19:04.340
or becomes repetitive if
it's used every single time.

00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:06.840
Imagine going through these slides
using a screen reader and hearing,

00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:08.930
"sparkle graphic"
every single time.

00:19:10.370 --> 00:19:13.350
Just like with my fleur-de-lis,
that decorative definition

00:19:13.350 --> 00:19:20.390
will change depending on the
content you're working on.

00:19:20.390 --> 00:19:24.520
The image on this slide is a grid
array of sample logo, concepts,

00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:26.700
all with Lorem ipsum
and filler text.

00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:33.480
While logos themselves are excluded
from accessibility requirements

00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:37.430
in the design sense,
they do still require alt text.

00:19:37.430 --> 00:19:42.170
As a static image, the alt text
should be organization name, logo.

00:19:42.170 --> 00:19:45.850
As in your organization name,
not literally "organization name".

00:19:45.850 --> 00:19:48.930
If there's a small subline
or tagline in the logo,

00:19:48.930 --> 00:19:51.790
or any text at all,
that should also be included

00:19:51.790 --> 00:19:55.350
with any abbreviations or
acronyms spelled out in full.

00:19:55.350 --> 00:20:00.690
Usually, you'll see E-S-T, est,
for estimated or established,

00:20:00.690 --> 00:20:04.180
and so you would want the alt
text to say, "Company logo,

00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:06.940
established 1957," or
whenever your year was.

00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:12.390
If you're using a logo cloud, ideally
these will be individual files

00:20:12.390 --> 00:20:15.540
with proper alt text
for each company.

00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:19.500
It's not uncommon to see a logo
cloud that is one single JPEG

00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:21.750
or image,
and the alt text for these ranges

00:20:21.750 --> 00:20:25.710
from listing out every single
company logo using commas

00:20:25.710 --> 00:20:30.940
or separators, or simply a
collection of client logos.

00:20:30.940 --> 00:20:33.050
I'm serious, I've seen that.

00:20:33.050 --> 00:20:34.050
Don't do that.

00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:41.080
If you have a logo in your main
menu, the alt text should be

00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:44.100
what we just discussed.

00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:47.080
However, if your logo is a
common practice linked back

00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:50.460
to the homepage, then you're going
to want it to be website name,

00:20:50.460 --> 00:20:55.370
home, because that
infers its destination.

00:20:55.370 --> 00:20:58.790
We'll talk a little bit more
about that in our next slide.

00:20:58.790 --> 00:20:59.790
Image links.

00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:07.150
Personally, I completely avoid
links, and I discourage my clients

00:21:07.150 --> 00:21:08.440
to do so.

00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:12.220
I would much rather prefer
to use images that add

00:21:12.220 --> 00:21:14.440
to the user's experience
rather than give them a game

00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:17.210
of hide and seek, trying to
figure out which images are links

00:21:17.210 --> 00:21:18.210
and which aren't.

00:21:19.020 --> 00:21:22.900
Especially in cases like WordPress
where some content creators make

00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:25.710
the image file the
default image link.

00:21:25.710 --> 00:21:28.660
This can be extremely confusing
and cause users to prevent clicking

00:21:28.660 --> 00:21:31.790
on any images with link as
they'd assume it just opened

00:21:31.790 --> 00:21:33.980
the image's media file.

00:21:33.980 --> 00:21:35.700
I don't like mixing
content like this

00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:38.180
because I feel like it doesn't
create a predictable experience

00:21:38.180 --> 00:21:40.030
in one way or another.

00:21:40.030 --> 00:21:44.010
For example, a website I audited
once had one of those featured

00:21:44.010 --> 00:21:46.180
on logo arrays we
just talked about.

00:21:47.300 --> 00:21:51.140
Something I didn't realize until
I began keyboard testing was

00:21:51.140 --> 00:21:54.790
the logo array was actually a
link to the press release page,

00:21:54.790 --> 00:21:57.850
and in this case,
it explodes non-keyboard users

00:21:57.850 --> 00:22:01.160
who may not even realize this
is a link unless they interacted

00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:02.450
with the image.

00:22:02.450 --> 00:22:05.233
That's just something somebody
casually scrolling down a page

00:22:05.234 --> 00:22:07.160
is unlikely to do.

00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:11.810
In cases of featured
image links on blog posts,

00:22:11.810 --> 00:22:15.300
an argument can be made,
even if the image also links

00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:17.910
to the blog post,
it can be the image's alt text

00:22:17.910 --> 00:22:21.497
if there is an alternative
clearly labeled link

00:22:21.498 --> 00:22:23.440
like the blog post title.

00:22:25.210 --> 00:22:28.310
This seems to be a case of personal
preference amongst the community

00:22:28.310 --> 00:22:30.370
with some people not caring
about the redundancy,

00:22:30.370 --> 00:22:33.260
and others preferring the
image not be a link at all.

00:22:33.260 --> 00:22:34.587
I like the image as a link

00:22:34.587 --> 00:22:37.620
because they're usually
a larger clicking area

00:22:37.620 --> 00:22:41.020
that gives people with mobility
issues a larger target,

00:22:41.020 --> 00:22:45.200
but I also understand
the issue of redundancy.

00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:47.760
This is one of those fun
accessibility gray areas

00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:50.900
that doesn't currently have a
100% solid best practice answer,

00:22:52.390 --> 00:22:55.420
because someone somewhere
has to compromise.

00:22:55.420 --> 00:22:59.200
I've seen some people use aria
hidden on a blog post image,

00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:01.570
and I'm not really sure
how they feel about that.

00:23:01.570 --> 00:23:06.970
This is just providing information
of the landscape right now.

00:23:08.230 --> 00:23:11.600
It's just generally not best
practice to hide user elements

00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:13.540
from a screen reader user.

00:23:13.540 --> 00:23:17.820
I'm sure the standards will
change in the upcoming years,

00:23:17.820 --> 00:23:20.100
but at this moment this
practice is still up in the air.

00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:25.170
Primarily, I see image
links that are text-based.

00:23:25.170 --> 00:23:28.750
I discourage this practice with
every accessible fiber in my body.

00:23:30.170 --> 00:23:32.610
Unlike standard text,
rendered text on images

00:23:32.610 --> 00:23:35.840
can't be programmatically
adjusted to become more readable.

00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:38.050
Often it's using a
script or display font,

00:23:38.050 --> 00:23:42.650
and a low contrast color combination
that makes it difficult to read,

00:23:42.650 --> 00:23:44.450
and I still see this all the time.

00:23:45.660 --> 00:23:48.540
For example, the image on this
slide says, "Read more about me."

00:23:48.540 --> 00:23:51.530
It's using hard to
read fonts and colors.

00:23:51.530 --> 00:23:55.720
The about is not only cursive, but
the blue has a lower contrast ratio,

00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:58.370
while the "read more",
if you can even see that at all,

00:23:58.370 --> 00:24:02.660
has a 1.5:1 contrast ratio
against the background.

00:24:02.660 --> 00:24:06.020
This is potentially unreadable
and can't be converted

00:24:06.020 --> 00:24:08.140
because it's rendered text.

00:24:08.140 --> 00:24:11.190
For this reason, text on images,
especially when they're intended

00:24:11.190 --> 00:24:13.780
as a link,
should be avoided completely.

00:24:17.070 --> 00:24:20.480
All right, my e-commerce friends, I
have a lot to say on product images.

00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:22.110
We're going to be on this
slide for a couple minutes.

00:24:23.510 --> 00:24:28.320
Some of the biggest alt text
woopsies I see are on product images.

00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:31.420
Most of the time they're long
file names which helps no one,

00:24:31.420 --> 00:24:32.470
including your SEO.

00:24:33.820 --> 00:24:35.830
If there are multiple
angles of the product,

00:24:35.830 --> 00:24:37.700
it's just repeatedly the file name.

00:24:39.540 --> 00:24:42.730
What makes for good
product alt text?

00:24:42.730 --> 00:24:45.750
That highly depends on the
product, but you want

00:24:45.750 --> 00:24:48.390
to visually describe it in a
way that is actually useful

00:24:48.390 --> 00:24:51.290
while reducing repetition and
keeping it as pithy as possible.

00:24:52.640 --> 00:25:01.120
On this slide,
we have an image of an orange couch.

00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:02.220
The couch is our product.

00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:06.350
How do you describe this couch
to someone who can't see it?

00:25:07.620 --> 00:25:09.640
What would be the selling points?

00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:12.260
When you read an actual
product description,

00:25:12.260 --> 00:25:16.200
they rarely include components
e-commerce owners generally assume

00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:17.380
would be visually deduced.

00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:24.370
A good example of a small detail
that could be included here is the--

00:25:24.370 --> 00:25:28.110
I forgot to do something, sorry.

00:25:28.110 --> 00:25:31.510
A good example of a small detail
that could be included here

00:25:31.510 --> 00:25:33.380
is the gap under the couch.

00:25:33.380 --> 00:25:34.660
I have three cats.

00:25:34.660 --> 00:25:36.980
I do not want a couch that
has a gap underneath it

00:25:36.980 --> 00:25:39.460
because it's just asking
to be clawed in the ankles,

00:25:40.590 --> 00:25:43.720
or to come across a hoard
of hair ties one day.

00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:46.660
Ideally, a detail like this
would be provided in the alt text

00:25:46.660 --> 00:25:48.800
because it can be an
important detail to someone.

00:25:49.890 --> 00:25:51.580
The back of this couch is very low.

00:25:51.580 --> 00:25:53.620
My partner is very tall.

00:25:53.620 --> 00:25:55.840
If we were going to buy a new
couch, we'd have

00:25:55.840 --> 00:25:59.730
to make sure it had a high
back to support his torso,

00:25:59.730 --> 00:26:03.390
but that may not necessarily be
described in the product description.

00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:08.010
What else could be important
potential deal-breakers?

00:26:08.010 --> 00:26:12.140
This is a two-cushion couch, maybe a
shopper would prefer a three-cushion.

00:26:12.140 --> 00:26:14.070
Do those pillows
come with the couch?

00:26:14.070 --> 00:26:16.960
Which is something hopefully
mentioned in the product description.

00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:21.260
This couch is very rectangular
and modern as opposed to curvy

00:26:21.260 --> 00:26:22.940
and traditional.

00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:26.000
These are examples of things we
can immediately deduce visually

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:27.040
that we take for granted.

00:26:29.140 --> 00:26:32.590
Usually, products have a primary
image, and this will probably

00:26:32.590 --> 00:26:35.730
be the most descriptive because
it's probably the first image

00:26:35.730 --> 00:26:38.270
that a user would land on.

00:26:38.270 --> 00:26:41.080
In this case,
I would describe this couch

00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:44.630
as modern plush
orange leather couch.

00:26:44.630 --> 00:26:47.370
Back support and armrest
are about the same height,

00:26:47.370 --> 00:26:50.270
with the low back about
three inches higher.

00:26:50.270 --> 00:26:52.630
Two seat cushions,
two back cushions.

00:26:52.630 --> 00:26:55.260
About a five-inch gap between
the floor and the couch.

00:26:55.260 --> 00:26:57.833
Couch support base is a
matching color wood base

00:26:57.834 --> 00:27:03.390
about two inches high, and feet are
cylindrical-shaped light wood pegs.

00:27:04.810 --> 00:27:07.650
It's lengthy, but it provides
enough information for a user

00:27:07.650 --> 00:27:09.680
to get a good idea of what
the product looks like

00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:12.830
while hopefully being supported
with actual dimensions facts

00:27:12.830 --> 00:27:14.100
in the product description.

00:27:15.390 --> 00:27:18.220
If there's another angle
of the couch provided,

00:27:18.220 --> 00:27:20.170
think of what new
information may be revealed.

00:27:21.470 --> 00:27:24.660
Does the side of the couch
come with a remote holder,

00:27:24.660 --> 00:27:27.720
or maybe there are cup holders
in the arms that we can't see

00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:28.720
from straight on?

00:27:30.290 --> 00:27:32.470
Additionally,
as we touched on earlier,

00:27:32.470 --> 00:27:35.840
product images are
best kept objective.

00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:40.250
You can use some subjective
adjectives like soft or high quality,

00:27:40.250 --> 00:27:42.830
because even if not everyone
agrees with that description,

00:27:42.830 --> 00:27:45.900
it may contribute to a more
accurate description of the product.

00:27:46.940 --> 00:27:51.010
Avoid subjective language like
comfortable or stunning, that may try

00:27:51.010 --> 00:27:53.260
to influence the user's
thoughts on a product

00:27:53.260 --> 00:27:59.250
that may not be
universally applicable.

00:27:59.250 --> 00:28:01.990
You also don't need to get
caught up in the details.

00:28:01.990 --> 00:28:05.200
For example, I call this couch
orange, but it's really more

00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:06.950
of a honey amber color.

00:28:08.140 --> 00:28:11.080
Colors are some of the most
subjective interpretations out there,

00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:13.300
and no two people will see
the color in the same way.

00:28:14.370 --> 00:28:16.620
Getting caught up in fancy
language or specifics

00:28:16.620 --> 00:28:19.640
to describe a single color
can just be a waste of time,

00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:23.690
and sometimes confusing
regardless of how accurate it is.

00:28:23.690 --> 00:28:26.610
Have you heard some of the
names of Pantone colors?

00:28:26.610 --> 00:28:28.850
Would you know what exuberance is?

00:28:28.850 --> 00:28:31.400
PS, it is basically the
color of this couch.

00:28:33.020 --> 00:28:35.320
Consider your variables also.

00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:37.571
Remember,
many people with disabilities

00:28:37.572 --> 00:28:39.260
are still independent people.

00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:43.270
How about a hypothetical scenario
that could literally occur

00:28:43.270 --> 00:28:45.590
between any set of partners?

00:28:45.590 --> 00:28:49.610
Maybe a visually impaired user
liked the description of the couch

00:28:49.610 --> 00:28:52.610
but knows their non-visually
impaired partner has

00:28:52.610 --> 00:28:54.890
a general color scheme
going on in the living room.

00:28:56.450 --> 00:28:59.600
Our visually impaired user
wants to text or email a picture

00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:02.550
of the couch to their partner after
hearing one of the variables is

00:29:02.550 --> 00:29:04.140
within the color scheme
of the living room.

00:29:05.470 --> 00:29:08.500
By providing a variable
color within the alt text,

00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:12.060
you can instill confidence that a
visually impaired user is downloading

00:29:12.060 --> 00:29:15.200
the correct version of the
image or sending the right link.

00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:18.830
By taking the extra few seconds
it takes to provide the alt text,

00:29:18.830 --> 00:29:20.440
you are allowing a
huge group of people

00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:23.420
to navigate your store
confidently and independently.

00:29:23.420 --> 00:29:27.080
That's huge and puts you ahead of
the pack considering there is still

00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:32.050
a lot of major online e-commerce
stores failing to do this.

00:29:34.340 --> 00:29:36.980
If you are an e-commerce
owner who is concerned

00:29:36.980 --> 00:29:40.100
about your own all text,
I have an experiment for you to try.

00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:44.620
Ask someone for help, like your
partner, family member, or friend,

00:29:44.620 --> 00:29:47.770
then go to a furniture store
or department, call them

00:29:47.770 --> 00:29:49.620
and describe an item.

00:29:49.620 --> 00:29:51.380
Let them ask questions.

00:29:51.380 --> 00:29:54.340
Once you're content with your
description, send them a photo

00:29:54.340 --> 00:29:57.330
of the item you're describing and see
if their mental picture matched up

00:29:57.330 --> 00:29:58.330
with the item.

00:29:58.980 --> 00:30:03.090
The other person can then tell you
if your description was accurate

00:30:03.090 --> 00:30:04.910
or where you could
have done better.

00:30:04.910 --> 00:30:07.110
Repeat this with a few items.

00:30:07.110 --> 00:30:10.980
Of course, you could choose
any store you want, I just find

00:30:10.980 --> 00:30:14.920
that furniture stores have the
largest variety of complex shapes

00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:17.670
and differences for
you to practice with.

00:30:17.670 --> 00:30:21.370
I do know it sounds a bit silly,
but it wouldn't take that much time,

00:30:21.370 --> 00:30:23.300
five minutes per item maybe.

00:30:23.300 --> 00:30:26.170
I think you'd be surprised
with how much you learn

00:30:26.170 --> 00:30:29.090
about describing your own products,
and the questions you need

00:30:29.090 --> 00:30:30.490
to answer in your alt text.

00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:38.603
Let's quickly go through
some examples of alt text

00:30:38.604 --> 00:30:40.930
on different kinds
of images.

00:30:41.830 --> 00:30:45.480
Given the time, we're going
to go into detail on our easy

00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:47.450
and then speed through the rest.

00:30:48.990 --> 00:30:52.670
On this slide,
there's a picture of a white cat

00:30:52.670 --> 00:30:55.810
with a tiny cloth towel
wrapped around it's head

00:30:55.811 --> 00:30:59.160
like someone would do
when they got out of the shower.

00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:01.970
It's in some sort of ceramic
bowl and is resting its head

00:31:01.970 --> 00:31:03.620
on the rim and looking
directly at the camera.

00:31:03.620 --> 00:31:06.530
If I had to describe
the look on its face,

00:31:06.530 --> 00:31:08.770
I'd say it's pretty fed
up with the photoshoot.

00:31:12.070 --> 00:31:14.800
Our bad examples is cat.

00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:17.550
This is a callback to
our one-word alt text.

00:31:17.550 --> 00:31:20.220
I assure you, there's a lot
more going on in this image

00:31:20.220 --> 00:31:23.930
than what can be discerned
with just the word "cat".

00:31:23.930 --> 00:31:27.910
Spa day here's another
callback to our captions.

00:31:27.910 --> 00:31:30.900
Captions are for being cute,
alt text is for being specific.

00:31:34.490 --> 00:31:37.630
Alt text is a cat with
a towel on its head.

00:31:37.630 --> 00:31:40.560
This isn't super descriptive, but
it's enough to get the point across,

00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:42.270
and it's better than
no alt text at all.

00:31:44.240 --> 00:31:47.140
Great alt text,
"A white cat with golden eyes

00:31:47.140 --> 00:31:50.410
and a small towel wrapped around
its head, sitting in a ceramic bowl

00:31:50.410 --> 00:31:52.800
with his head resting on the rim,
looking directly at the camera."

00:31:54.530 --> 00:31:57.360
If it's not super important
for the context of the image,

00:31:57.360 --> 00:31:59.430
it's okay to make intuitive leaps.

00:31:59.430 --> 00:32:03.140
For example, I have no idea what kind
of container this cat is sitting in.

00:32:03.140 --> 00:32:05.880
There's ridges on it,
which remind me of pottery,

00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:10.170
so in my interpretation I say
ceramic bowl, but for all I know

00:32:10.170 --> 00:32:11.240
that's a vase or a hamper.

00:32:12.350 --> 00:32:16.110
You don't need to be so worried
about maybe getting a detail wrong

00:32:16.110 --> 00:32:17.860
that you cave under
your own pressure.

00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:23.150
We can also remove some words for
the sake of time and efficiency.

00:32:23.150 --> 00:32:26.310
Details that can be changed or
removed while retaining integrity,

00:32:26.310 --> 00:32:29.730
eye color, ceramic,
looking directly at the camera.

00:32:30.980 --> 00:32:35.330
I like adding things like looking
directly at the camera/fourth wall

00:32:35.330 --> 00:32:37.470
because I feel like it sets a mood.

00:32:37.470 --> 00:32:41.380
People looking up in photos generally
implies wonder and imagination.

00:32:41.380 --> 00:32:44.730
Like a person looking up at the sky,
or a kid looking at their parent.

00:32:46.150 --> 00:32:48.520
Looking [inaudible]

00:32:50.650 --> 00:32:52.290
implies [inaudible]

00:32:54.330 --> 00:32:57.900
directly at the audience can
imply annoyance or confidence,

00:32:57.900 --> 00:32:59.250
and in some cases seduction.

00:33:01.180 --> 00:33:03.810
Depending on the context,
adding those details could add

00:33:03.810 --> 00:33:06.340
an entire range of
mood to your image,

00:33:06.340 --> 00:33:08.930
but if you feel like you're running
too long with your alt text,

00:33:08.930 --> 00:33:11.920
it could be something that is
excluded for the sake of efficiency.

00:33:13.530 --> 00:33:16.840
More considerations that
can change alt text.

00:33:16.840 --> 00:33:19.020
The reason you're using this
image, and we're going

00:33:19.020 --> 00:33:22.640
to talk about that a lot.

00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:24.900
It should be reflected
in your alt text,

00:33:24.900 --> 00:33:28.450
especially if it's more relevant
to the content of the page it's on.

00:33:28.450 --> 00:33:32.260
For example, my alt text for this
photo is a general description,

00:33:32.260 --> 00:33:36.320
but if this photo was on a satirical
post about dressing up cats,

00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:38.810
it may be more important
to focus on the cat's

00:33:38.810 --> 00:33:41.860
somewhat annoyed expression
rather than go into details

00:33:41.860 --> 00:33:43.370
about what kind of bowl it's in.

00:33:46.830 --> 00:33:50.480
The image on this page
is a beautiful painting.

00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:53.790
The canvas is primarily focused
on a huge intimidating dragon.

00:33:55.300 --> 00:33:58.110
Below it is a lone soldier
standing on the edge of the cliff,

00:33:58.110 --> 00:34:00.250
holding a sword and
staring up the dragon

00:34:00.250 --> 00:34:02.990
who's exhaling a small stream of
fire in the soldier's direction.

00:34:04.020 --> 00:34:06.790
The background is a dark
stormy sky with a large ray

00:34:06.790 --> 00:34:09.190
of sunlight penetrating the clouds.

00:34:09.190 --> 00:34:11.170
You can see several
other dragons soaring

00:34:11.170 --> 00:34:12.990
in the background
illuminated by the sun ray.

00:34:12.990 --> 00:34:20.440
An image like this is completely open
for interpretation, as most art is.

00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:23.720
Everyone would have a different
idea of what the alt text would be,

00:34:23.720 --> 00:34:24.520
and that's okay.

00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:26.650
It's part of the fun of art.

00:34:26.650 --> 00:34:29.760
It's intended to evoke different
feelings for different people.

00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:32.020
Depending on which
day you upload this,

00:34:32.020 --> 00:34:34.860
you could feel more like the
dragon or more like the soldier,

00:34:34.860 --> 00:34:37.670
and that would change
the interpretation,

00:34:37.670 --> 00:34:38.950
which would affect your alt text.

00:34:40.474 --> 00:34:43.454
Something I also didn't notice
until the 10th time I looked

00:34:43.462 --> 00:34:46.212
at this painting is there's actually
a rider on top of the dragon.

00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:56.150
Is the rider there to fight
the soldier or help him?

00:34:56.150 --> 00:34:57.862
I'm going to go with that.

00:34:58.890 --> 00:35:01.160
Maybe he's there to pick
him up like a dragon Uber.

00:35:03.019 --> 00:35:05.769
What is the intention
of this photo?

00:35:05.770 --> 00:35:10.650
How this painting is described likely
depends on who is presenting it.

00:35:10.650 --> 00:35:13.220
With art being subjective and
interpretive in and of itself,

00:35:13.220 --> 00:35:17.050
having subjective alt text based
on the writer's interpretation is

00:35:17.050 --> 00:35:19.180
only going to be natural.

00:35:19.180 --> 00:35:22.380
That's part of the joy, is reading
everybody else's interpretation.

00:35:22.380 --> 00:35:26.030
I would love to see this
painting up on a blog post

00:35:26.030 --> 00:35:28.520
with alt text written
by 10 different people.

00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:31.520
I think that would be
amazing, but that's just me.

00:35:34.820 --> 00:35:38.710
On this slide, there's a pie chart
labeled The Best Movies Ever.

00:35:38.710 --> 00:35:40.810
The pie slivers do not
include percentages,

00:35:40.810 --> 00:35:45.670
so the data is completely visual,
and assumptions would be made based

00:35:45.670 --> 00:35:47.950
on visually observing
the sizes of the slivers.

00:35:50.210 --> 00:35:53.480
I noticed too late that one
of the titles is messed up,

00:35:53.480 --> 00:35:57.240
but the titles were supposed
to say Waiting for Forever,

00:35:57.240 --> 00:36:01.690
The Naked Gun, The Boondock Saints,
A Scanner Darkly, Moulin Rouge!,

00:36:01.690 --> 00:36:02.690
and Pirate Radio.

00:36:04.450 --> 00:36:08.850
Charts and graphs require special
attention when creating alt text.

00:36:08.850 --> 00:36:12.430
In my experience, they're also some
of the most overlooked, skipped,

00:36:12.430 --> 00:36:16.430
or even overwhelming examples of
alt text when they really don't need

00:36:16.430 --> 00:36:17.430
to be.

00:36:17.930 --> 00:36:20.270
The thing is if you have the graph,

00:36:20.270 --> 00:36:23.280
then you already have the data
you need for the alt text,

00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:26.670
but providing too much information
or unnecessary information

00:36:26.670 --> 00:36:29.870
is a quick way to make the
data lost on your readers.

00:36:29.870 --> 00:36:34.080
As you can see, in my unnecessarily
long example, that alt text

00:36:34.080 --> 00:36:36.570
that I'm not going
to bore you with.

00:36:36.570 --> 00:36:38.290
It's just a bad example,
that's too long.

00:36:38.290 --> 00:36:39.290
This is tiny graph.

00:36:41.860 --> 00:36:46.200
For some data, I have seen alt
text that states the lowest end

00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:51.580
of the data results, this is in my
okay section, and the highest end,

00:36:51.580 --> 00:36:54.600
leaving the middle ground
open for interpretation.

00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:58.900
If this is a casual chart,
I don't know, something you'd see

00:36:58.900 --> 00:37:04.150
on Buzzfeed poll results, this
could be considered okay alt text

00:37:04.150 --> 00:37:07.140
as long as all of the data
types were listed at some point.

00:37:08.380 --> 00:37:11.560
If we're talking about
important data or a statistics,

00:37:11.560 --> 00:37:15.100
I wouldn't risk any sort of
inference, and would stick

00:37:15.100 --> 00:37:17.830
to something like our
great example which says,

00:37:17.830 --> 00:37:20.560
"A pie chart illustrating poll
results for the best movies:

00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:24.530
The Naked Gun: 30%, The Boondock
Saints: 25%, Moulin Rouge!:

00:37:24.530 --> 00:37:27.660
15%, Pirate Radio:
15%, A Scanner Darkly:

00:37:27.660 --> 00:37:30.470
10%, Waiting for Forever: 5%."

00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:34.400
Just straight to the point.

00:37:36.200 --> 00:37:38.820
That all being said, the number
one rule for making a chart

00:37:38.820 --> 00:37:41.200
or graph accessible has
nothing to do with the alt text

00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:45.400
but a supportive description
directly pre or proceeding the graph.

00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:48.920
Not doing this is an extremely
common form of human error.

00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:52.560
That's being so familiar with
a concept or of data results

00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:54.590
that you forget the people
you're explaining it

00:37:54.590 --> 00:37:57.600
to may not have the subject
grasped as well as you do.

00:37:58.630 --> 00:38:00.760
It's no different than
letting a kid cook with you

00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:03.550
while you give them instructions,
only for them to ask

00:38:03.550 --> 00:38:05.430
what folding an egg means.

00:38:05.430 --> 00:38:08.310
You've done it so many times,
and it's so simple to you,

00:38:08.310 --> 00:38:11.600
you may have momentarily forgotten
that someone else isn't familiar

00:38:11.600 --> 00:38:13.140
with the process of egg folding.

00:38:15.090 --> 00:38:19.970
This is why supportive description
of graph or chart explaining the data

00:38:19.970 --> 00:38:22.070
and the results is so important.

00:38:22.070 --> 00:38:24.090
That's not just for
your visually impaired

00:38:24.090 --> 00:38:27.460
or cognitively impaired users,
but for all of your users.

00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:34.670
Alt text is becoming an available
feature on major platforms every day,

00:38:34.670 --> 00:38:37.360
but it's up to the
uploader to utilize it.

00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:39.584
Obviously I can't tell you
every single place alt text

00:38:39.584 --> 00:38:43.121
is available on, but whenever
you upload an image somewhere,

00:38:43.121 --> 00:38:50.170
try looking for an edit button or
if some sort of alt text button

00:38:50.170 --> 00:38:52.390
is immediately available.

00:38:52.390 --> 00:38:55.790
My image on this slide is a
screenshot of a Gmail composition.

00:38:55.790 --> 00:38:57.810
As pictured, when you focus
on the embedded image,

00:38:57.810 --> 00:39:00.960
the toolbar has an
option to edit alt text.

00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:04.230
However, in cases like Slack and
Discord, you have to hunt a little

00:39:04.230 --> 00:39:07.480
and edit the files' details and a
little modal, which can sometimes

00:39:07.480 --> 00:39:08.480
be a little bit hard to find.

00:39:09.910 --> 00:39:12.260
I highly encourage users
to implement alt text,

00:39:12.260 --> 00:39:15.650
even if they're competent or
recipients aren't visually impaired.

00:39:15.650 --> 00:39:19.920
For example, I run a Discord server,
and it contains a small group

00:39:19.920 --> 00:39:22.100
of friends I know personally.

00:39:22.100 --> 00:39:25.040
I know none of them need
alt text at the moment,

00:39:25.040 --> 00:39:28.680
but I still like adding alt text to
my images because it's good practice.

00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:31.520
The more you do something and the
more second nature it becomes.

00:39:31.520 --> 00:39:35.210
Soon a simple act of adding an
image description doesn't become

00:39:35.210 --> 00:39:38.300
such an enormous undertaking,
but it's just a good habit

00:39:38.300 --> 00:39:39.850
that is naturally a
part of your process

00:39:39.850 --> 00:39:41.600
that you eventually don't
even think about anymore.

00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:47.790
In my opinion, a huge part of what
accessibility is future-proofing

00:39:47.790 --> 00:39:48.790
for everyone.

00:39:49.270 --> 00:39:51.550
Similar to an example
we provided early on,

00:39:51.550 --> 00:39:54.280
how embarrassing would it
be for a content creator

00:39:54.280 --> 00:39:58.100
to ignorantly disregard accessibility
and deem it unnecessary,

00:39:58.100 --> 00:40:00.190
and then be unable to
use their own website

00:40:00.190 --> 00:40:01.750
if they became disabled one day.

00:40:02.830 --> 00:40:06.620
The fact is, be it due to aging,
an illness, or an accident,

00:40:06.620 --> 00:40:10.360
most people will develop an
disability of some sort at some point

00:40:10.360 --> 00:40:11.750
in their life.

00:40:11.750 --> 00:40:15.270
When or if this happens to one of
my friends on the Discord server,

00:40:15.270 --> 00:40:17.300
I like the idea that they
can still feel included

00:40:17.300 --> 00:40:19.420
in my channel under
any circumstances.

00:40:22.740 --> 00:40:26.240
On this slide, we have an
image of a man with a beard

00:40:26.240 --> 00:40:30.810
and glasses smiling at the
camera and giving a thumbs up.

00:40:30.810 --> 00:40:33.670
We're going to sum it all
up with a few key takeaways

00:40:33.670 --> 00:40:35.530
to consider when
writing your all text.

00:40:37.510 --> 00:40:39.150
Is the alt text you've
written indicative

00:40:39.150 --> 00:40:40.940
of the reason the image was chosen?

00:40:41.970 --> 00:40:45.050
I've repeated this a few times but
it's just really important to me.

00:40:45.050 --> 00:40:49.490
Alt text for the same image
could be different depending

00:40:49.490 --> 00:40:53.130
on the context as we've
discussed with the cat earlier.

00:40:53.130 --> 00:40:56.630
This may not always be
true to the literal image,

00:40:56.630 --> 00:40:59.230
and will rely on subtext
as opposed to context.

00:41:00.890 --> 00:41:05.400
A good example of intentions is,
like any other 32 year old adult,

00:41:05.400 --> 00:41:07.830
I love watching Pokemon
on Amazon Prime.

00:41:08.870 --> 00:41:11.560
If you've ever watched
Pokemon before, you know that

00:41:11.560 --> 00:41:15.790
with few exceptions, Pokemon such
as Pikachu only say their name.

00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:19.940
If the captions were going to
be literal, they would read,

00:41:19.940 --> 00:41:25.870
"Pika, Pika, Pikachu," and that's
not helpful despite it being literal.

00:41:25.870 --> 00:41:29.950
What Amazon Prime does instead
is use the caption for intention.

00:41:29.950 --> 00:41:33.300
They will say something like
determined, angry, annoyed,

00:41:33.300 --> 00:41:36.990
or joyful depending on what
the Pokemon is conveying

00:41:36.990 --> 00:41:38.590
with their Pika, Pika, Pikachu.

00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:43.300
That is so much more
insightful than just captioning

00:41:43.300 --> 00:41:44.920
the Pokemon literally.

00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:47.980
That same philosophy should be
considered when writing alt text.

00:41:49.400 --> 00:41:54.310
Speaking of philosophy, is your
alt text enforcing your philosophy

00:41:54.310 --> 00:41:55.310
and brand.

00:41:55.910 --> 00:41:58.860
What I intentionally left out of
my image description is the man

00:41:58.860 --> 00:41:59.860
in this photo is Black.

00:42:00.700 --> 00:42:04.010
The alt text of the stock photo on
the site actually describes this man

00:42:04.010 --> 00:42:05.950
as a project manager.

00:42:05.950 --> 00:42:09.580
Unfortunately, if we describe a
photo as a project manager smiling

00:42:09.580 --> 00:42:12.900
and giving the thumbs up to the
camera, many users are more likely

00:42:12.900 --> 00:42:14.900
to picture a white guy
in a business suit.

00:42:16.340 --> 00:42:19.290
Haben Girma, a Black human rights
lawyer known as the deafblind woman

00:42:19.290 --> 00:42:22.510
who conquered Harvard Law,
due to her biographical book,

00:42:22.510 --> 00:42:25.470
has mentioned several times
people assume she's white,

00:42:25.470 --> 00:42:28.570
and encourages diversity
declarations in alt text as a way

00:42:28.570 --> 00:42:33.300
to help combat racism, sexism,
and other forms of social oppression.

00:42:35.370 --> 00:42:38.660
While not an obligation,
if this is important

00:42:38.660 --> 00:42:42.060
to your company's philosophy,
you should be in the habit

00:42:42.060 --> 00:42:44.890
of describing things like race,
gender, and even sexuality.

00:42:48.050 --> 00:42:50.560
Does your alt text effectively
describe your image in

00:42:50.560 --> 00:42:52.630
as few characters as possible?

00:42:52.630 --> 00:42:54.470
Just be cognizant of people's time.

00:42:56.920 --> 00:43:00.040
Lastly, don't worry so much
about creating perfect alt text

00:43:00.040 --> 00:43:02.260
because it doesn't exist.

00:43:02.260 --> 00:43:03.930
Everyone perceives
things differently,

00:43:03.930 --> 00:43:06.690
and will interpret the
image differently than you.

00:43:06.690 --> 00:43:10.800
Practicing all text is about bringing
others into that conversation.

00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:11.941
There's a saying that goes,

00:43:11.942 --> 00:43:13.970
"If you're not intentionally
including others,

00:43:13.970 --> 00:43:17.300
you're unintentionally
excluding them."

00:43:17.300 --> 00:43:20.840
Just start consciously thinking about
how you can start including people

00:43:20.840 --> 00:43:23.554
into the conversations
you're initiating every time

00:43:23.555 --> 00:43:24.650
you upload an image.

00:43:27.060 --> 00:43:29.610
With that, I have been Meg Miller.

00:43:29.610 --> 00:43:35.110
I'm available on Twitter, and I'm
the lead developer for AccessiCart.

00:43:35.110 --> 00:43:37.329
Suddenly I've forgotten who I
am, so I'm just reading

00:43:37.330 --> 00:43:38.520
this straight off the slide.

00:43:38.520 --> 00:43:39.520
Thank you for tuning in.

00:43:42.770 --> 00:43:44.210
How do I stop here?

00:43:44.210 --> 00:43:45.050
>> CARRIE: Hey.

00:43:45.050 --> 00:43:46.540
Thank you so much, Meg.

00:43:46.540 --> 00:43:48.930
That was super informative.

00:43:48.930 --> 00:43:51.490
I've been working with
alt text for a long time

00:43:51.490 --> 00:43:52.930
but I learned a few things there.

00:43:54.640 --> 00:43:57.480
We had a question, and then you
actually touched on it there

00:43:57.480 --> 00:43:59.530
in that final slide.

00:44:01.190 --> 00:44:04.020
Maybe just to
reiterate the question.

00:44:04.020 --> 00:44:07.540
Is there an appropriate way to
write alt text for a person's image?

00:44:08.860 --> 00:44:12.430
Then asking the same question
whether it's a stock image

00:44:12.430 --> 00:44:14.970
or an actual photo
of someone you know.

00:44:16.810 --> 00:44:18.760
The person asking the question
says, "I don't want

00:44:18.760 --> 00:44:21.780
to misrepresent that
person or get it wrong."

00:44:21.780 --> 00:44:23.961
Any notes around that?

00:44:24.410 --> 00:44:27.260
>> MEG: There is not a
100% answer for this.

00:44:27.260 --> 00:44:29.330
Actually, the last time
I gave this presentation,

00:44:29.330 --> 00:44:30.850
somebody asked that
exact same thing.

00:44:33.450 --> 00:44:39.980
It's always different, and it
always depends on the writers.

00:44:39.980 --> 00:44:41.490
Like headshots at a company.

00:44:41.490 --> 00:44:43.900
Obviously you don't-- I
have that same yeti mug.

00:44:43.900 --> 00:44:48.740
At the same time you don't want
to have this the name repeated,

00:44:48.740 --> 00:44:51.760
because that's not
helpful, so what do you do?

00:44:51.760 --> 00:44:56.200
It is so hard to answer.

00:44:57.420 --> 00:45:00.330
For stock images, those people
know what they're getting into.

00:45:00.330 --> 00:45:05.700
You can describe them whatever
is important to what's going on.

00:45:07.380 --> 00:45:12.220
What I like to
recommend to people is

00:45:12.220 --> 00:45:15.300
if there is something like
a headshot being uploaded is

00:45:15.300 --> 00:45:18.750
to actually ask your employees
to provide their alt text.

00:45:20.030 --> 00:45:23.800
That would be my best
recommendation, because that struggle

00:45:23.800 --> 00:45:25.660
to misrepresent somebody is real.

00:45:27.280 --> 00:45:31.220
When it comes to people you
actually know, my best advice is

00:45:31.220 --> 00:45:33.430
to ask them how they
want to be described.

00:45:33.430 --> 00:45:38.450
If you're describing stock
images, general descriptions,

00:45:38.450 --> 00:45:40.270
whatever is important
about the image.

00:45:40.270 --> 00:45:45.930
I hope that helps.

00:45:45.930 --> 00:45:48.190
I'm sorry I can't
give you 100% answer

00:45:48.190 --> 00:45:51.470
because this is just not
a question that has one.

00:45:51.470 --> 00:45:52.390
>> CARRIE: Really helpful.

00:45:52.390 --> 00:45:53.570
Thank you.

00:45:53.570 --> 00:45:56.320
We've got about five minutes
here, so see

00:45:56.320 --> 00:45:58.520
if I can get some
quick questions to you.

00:45:59.560 --> 00:46:03.370
Does the screen reader also read
the caption or only the alt text?

00:46:03.370 --> 00:46:05.310
>> MEG: It will read the caption.

00:46:05.310 --> 00:46:07.140
That's why you don't
want to have alt text

00:46:07.140 --> 00:46:10.280
and the caption be the same thing
because then it just says it twice.

00:46:12.390 --> 00:46:16.170
It's one thing if they're
different, but just try not

00:46:16.170 --> 00:46:17.170
to make them duplicate.

00:46:17.850 --> 00:46:18.720
>> CARRIE: Got you.

00:46:20.080 --> 00:46:24.420
How do you approach training
content creators on this process?

00:46:24.420 --> 00:46:28.120
It can be complicated to make
decisions but as you say best not

00:46:28.120 --> 00:46:29.790
to overthink it.

00:46:29.790 --> 00:46:33.000
How would you bridge that
contradiction and training?

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:35.460
>> MEG: When you find out
how to train content creators

00:46:35.460 --> 00:46:37.380
to implement alt text, tell me.

00:46:40.350 --> 00:46:44.510
You will get better at alt text
every single time you do it.

00:46:44.510 --> 00:46:47.000
If you scroll back far enough in
my Twitter, I don't have alt text

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:51.240
on a lot of my images because it
just wasn't the practice I was in,

00:46:51.240 --> 00:46:54.240
but I started doing it and
then you get better at it.

00:46:54.240 --> 00:46:56.270
You start putting
your own twist on it.

00:46:56.270 --> 00:46:57.740
It's okay to be funny.

00:46:57.740 --> 00:47:00.540
Like I said in my slide,
you can be funny in your alt text

00:47:00.540 --> 00:47:03.360
and really express who you are
as the writer in your alt text.

00:47:07.720 --> 00:47:09.420
It's just getting them to start.

00:47:09.420 --> 00:47:12.250
That is the thing.

00:47:12.250 --> 00:47:15.590
As they practice, they start
getting more comfortable with it.

00:47:15.590 --> 00:47:15.990
"You know what?

00:47:15.990 --> 00:47:17.150
I can start adding this.

00:47:17.150 --> 00:47:18.580
I can start adding that.

00:47:18.580 --> 00:47:21.040
I think this would be a good
description for this image.

00:47:21.040 --> 00:47:25.340
How would I imagine this image if
I were having somebody describe it

00:47:25.340 --> 00:47:26.200
to me?"

00:47:26.200 --> 00:47:28.400
Those are the practices
people start thinking of

00:47:28.400 --> 00:47:31.920
as they start doing alt text more.

00:47:32.457 --> 00:47:33.305
>> CARRIE: That's fantastic.

00:47:34.280 --> 00:47:36.250
One last question for you.

00:47:36.250 --> 00:47:40.420
Going back to an e-commerce
store, if the alt text is the same

00:47:40.420 --> 00:47:45.360
as the product title, then screen
readers read the product name twice.

00:47:45.360 --> 00:47:48.410
Is that laziness or
is that acceptable?

00:47:51.160 --> 00:47:58.170
>> MEG: That would depend on if
your entire product title describe

00:47:58.170 --> 00:48:02.510
the image because
the whole [inaudible]

00:48:07.850 --> 00:48:13.240
if you just have an orange
couch in your product title,

00:48:13.240 --> 00:48:15.600
that isn't describing
the image properly.

00:48:17.520 --> 00:48:21.330
Actually that slide is
birthed out of this question

00:48:21.330 --> 00:48:23.450
that happened the
last time I gave this,

00:48:23.450 --> 00:48:25.570
except last time it was blue couch.

00:48:25.570 --> 00:48:27.100
Those details need to be told.

00:48:27.100 --> 00:48:29.210
You're not going to say
the gap between the couch

00:48:29.210 --> 00:48:30.280
and the product description.

00:48:30.280 --> 00:48:32.700
I've never seen something
like that before anyway.

00:48:32.700 --> 00:48:36.090
That's the kind of stuff that
needs to go into the alt text.

00:48:36.090 --> 00:48:38.510
They already know what
the product is called.

00:48:39.740 --> 00:48:41.490
Alt text is for describing
what it looks like.

00:48:42.553 --> 00:48:43.160
>> CARRIE: Awesome.

00:48:43.160 --> 00:48:47.650
Thank you so much, Meg, for sharing
your knowledge and experience.

00:48:47.650 --> 00:48:50.210
