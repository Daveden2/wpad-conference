WEBVTT

00:00:00.015 --> 00:00:30.097
[Long pause]

00:00:31.031 --> 00:00:32.930
<v Devin Egger> Hey, everyone,
thank you for joining us

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:35.730
on WordPress Accessibility Day.

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.200
My name is Devin Egger, I'll be
hosting the last three sessions here.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.700
Thanks for joining us.

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.544
Up next,
we've got a awesome presentation

00:00:43.544 --> 00:00:44.730
that I am very excited for.

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.230
Boost Up Conversions With
Accessible E-commerce.

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.543
It's going to be presented by
Anne-Mieke Bovelett,

00:00:51.568 --> 00:00:56.639
accessibility and possibility advocate
https://annebovelett.edu

00:00:56.664 --> 00:01:01.370
and Lazar Bulatovic, blind public speaking
coach at GlobalSpeak,

00:01:01.402 --> 00:01:05.455
and Piccia Neri, designer, speaker,
educator, and accessibility advocate

00:01:05.495 --> 00:01:07.840
at Design for Conversions.

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.747
Thanks for joining us and
looking forward to this next one.

00:01:18.507 --> 00:01:19.755
<v Piccia Neri> Hello.

00:01:19.793 --> 00:01:20.980
<v Anne-Mieke Bovelett>
Hello, everyone.

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:22.282
<v Lazar Bulatovic> Hi.

00:01:22.282 --> 00:01:24.395
<v Piccia> Hi.
We're on.

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:25.826
[laughs]

00:01:25.961 --> 00:01:27.360
<v Lazar> Yes, we are.

00:01:27.977 --> 00:01:31.446
<v Anne-Mieke> Yeah, would you 
like me to take the lead, Piccia?

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:37.900
<v Piccia> Yes, go ahead,
Anne, you're the best at this.

00:01:37.948 --> 00:01:41.059
<v Anne-Mieke> Oh,
but not good enough by far

00:01:41.162 --> 00:01:43.445
but we're learning all the time, right?

00:01:43.892 --> 00:01:45.868
So…

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:52.010
Ah, I just read that Devin said you
forgot to say things about questions.

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:55.180
Devin, would you like to say
something about questions?

00:01:56.994 --> 00:01:58.085
No? Okay.

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:03.930
I think people can ask questions
at the end of the session.

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.570
Devin already introduced us.

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:14.290
Today, we are with Lazar, who is a
very experienced screen reader user,

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.940
and we would like to show how
you can boost up your conversions

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.200
by making your webshop accessible,

00:02:21.225 --> 00:02:24.157
or especially why this is so important

00:02:24.181 --> 00:02:29.080
and that it's not rocket science
if you really think about it.

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.886
This, of course, has
a lot to do with design

00:02:32.918 --> 00:02:37.592
and it has a lot to do with
coding and content as always.

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:44.610
One of the things that I would
like to achieve today is that

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.807
by seeing how Lazar experiences webshops

00:02:48.832 --> 00:02:51.422
when they work or
when they don't work,

00:02:51.446 --> 00:02:55.069
that you can see where
the glitches really are.

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:00.244
It's unfortunate we would have
had António Carreira with us today

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:04.980
Unfortunately, in the end, something
stopped him from being here.

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.280
We're really sorry we hope
to having him on next time.

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:13.440
Whereas the development part
goes, I will try to explain

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.239
as much as I can.

00:03:15.263 --> 00:03:19.200
Now, Lazar is the world's first

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.880
and only blind-speaking coach.

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.280
He's going to tell some
more about his work.

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:28.831
Piccia is a wonderful
experienced designer,

00:03:28.856 --> 00:03:33.870
very strong in typography, which is
incredibly important also for accessibility

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.520
and a very experienced designer.

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.680
She's also one of the
people who can tell you

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.140
that you can really create very
colorful, very smashing designs

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:50.560
for people who can see so that
a site will also be attractive

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.950
to people who are not blind
or have visual troubles.

00:03:54.950 --> 00:04:00.810
I will say more about what you
can do code-wise and design-wise,

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:05.040
whereas design is something technical
to make something navigable.

00:04:06.092 --> 00:04:08.350
Did I forget something, 
Piccia? Lazar?

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:11.082
<v Piccia> No, so, one of the reasons why
<v Lazar> No.

00:04:11.107 --> 00:04:14.010
<v Piccia> it's nice to have you start, Anne,

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:16.960
is so that you could
flatter us so much.

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:19.200
Thank you very much for that.

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:23.420
Let me just say that you
are also an amazing designer

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:29.120
and I am learning so much from you
because you're also very code minded.

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:30.980
You teach me all the time.

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:33.750
I think that you're a very
good example for the community

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:36.850
at large of someone who
really understands design

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:40.200
but also understands development,
and you always do your best

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:44.760
to actually properly get
ourselves in the shoes of someone

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:48.560
who experiences the web and
the world differently from us.

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:51.910
Because there's one
thing, and Lazar I think

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:56.040
you can probably confirm
this, it's so interesting

00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:01.720
how if something is far from our
experience, it doesn't exist.

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:06.580
I was actually reading
about this yesterday.

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:12.770
I think only a few of
us have actually an idea

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:17.450
of how the web is experienced by
someone who uses a screen reader.

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:21.120
I am learning so much from
Lazar and the experience

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.720
is really interesting
in so many ways.

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:27.240
I think that we should
go into it now and see

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:31.020
because there are so many more
observations that will come up

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:31.670
as we go through it.

00:05:32.966 --> 00:05:35.105
<v Lazar> The thing
you just mentioned,

00:05:35.106 --> 00:05:42.500
Piccia, is very interesting because
since I started, let's say being part

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:47.560
of the accessibility community
which happened let's say on May

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:56.050
or April this year, I was shocked
on one side and on the other hand,

00:05:56.050 --> 00:06:03.090
amazed how people are not aware
of the things that are related

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:08.200
to using the web and web
experience from the perspective

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:10.910
of a totally blind and
a screen reader user.

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:17.400
Ever since my first call with
Maja Loncar from GoDaddy Pro,

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:23.230
hopefully, she is following
this stream, if you are, Maja,

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:26.670
with us then, hello.

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:28.240
Good to speak here.

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:34.630
Everyone was amazed, "No,
we never seen this before.

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:36.540
How does it work?"

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:42.070
I have been using the web like
this and it's not only me,

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:44.710
it's hundreds of thousands
of blind users around.

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:51.600
In my case, it's been
since 2004 and I don't know

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:54.260
some other different ways.

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:55.920
That's natural to me.

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:57.700
This is how I live.

00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:01.960
This is what I do every day and
for me, it's nothing strange.

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:05.560
"How can you do?

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:10.100
This website is not accessible or
it's not the most accessible one

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:14.710
on earth" No problem, let's
try to do something about that.

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:19.710
For example, if the webshop is
not accessible, I can call someone

00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:22.130
who is sighted.

00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:27.670
If that does not work as well,
I can definitely figure it out.

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:34.040
Definitely accessibility is a huge
topic and I'm happy to be here

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:38.110
and try to open some
avenues for each of you.

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:42.480
<v Anne-Mieke> It's so wonderful
that you are with us today, Lazar.

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:46.130
I'm really grateful that you
are and I'm also so grateful

00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:50.160
to Maja Loncar from GoDaddy
Pro who introduced us all.

00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:54.210
I think we're going to
have a great session.

00:07:54.210 --> 00:07:57.860
Now, to what you were saying
that it was surprising for you

00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:03.040
to see that so few people are
aware, I was one of those people up

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:04.440
until two years ago.

00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:09.630
This is also one of the messages
I'd love to bring across people.

00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:14.400
Perfect is the enemy of good.

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:17.040
When you are getting
into accessibility now

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:22.830
and you learn there is so much
to learn, don't be demotivated

00:08:22.830 --> 00:08:23.710
because of that.

00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:27.010
Because you'll see an avalanche
of information coming towards you.

00:08:27.010 --> 00:08:32.480
Just chop it up in small sections
and you will be doing fine.

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:37.230
What was that like for you, Piccia?

00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:40.580
We are on a panel let's
talk about what it was like.

00:08:41.017 --> 00:08:43.740
<v Piccia> For me,
I'm the same as you.

00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:48.760
I started becoming aware of
this thing called [chuckles]

00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:54.320
accessibility, fully aware and
championing it a bit like you

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:59.790
a couple of years,
but before then, I used to be

00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:02.060
just a full-on creative designer.

00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:05.150
I'm still creative,
but I do different things now.

00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:08.350
When you are a creative designer,
you're actually striving

00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:10.410
to make things as
cryptic as [chuckles]

00:09:10.410 --> 00:09:14.368
possible often because
that's not what

00:09:14.369 --> 00:09:17.920
the marketing department asks for.

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:20.400
You're trying to be really clever.

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:24.240
On the web, what we need
to do is be really helpful.

00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:27.930
It's the opposite.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.950
That's why I think it's so
valuable that we experience Lazar.

00:09:32.950 --> 00:09:35.740
This time we have Lazar
and next time maybe someone

00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:37.290
who has a different
accessibility because there are

00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:40.750
so many different ways
of experiencing the web.

00:09:40.750 --> 00:09:43.350
It's just different
it's all that it is.

00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:47.630
I think that the biggest mentality
shift that needs to happen is

00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:52.020
that there isn't a right way
or a wrong way or a normal way,

00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:57.020
that word, it's just different
ways of experiencing.

00:09:57.020 --> 00:10:01.680
I love the fact, Anne,
that we decided that we were going

00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:03.380
to use the Tesco
website, didn't we?

00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:04.600
<v Anne-Mieke> Yes.

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:08.827
<v Piccia> Because you have, Anne,

00:10:08.828 --> 00:10:15.010
onsite there's a really
useful article on Tesco.

00:10:15.010 --> 00:10:22.490
Tesco is a supermarket in the
United Kingdom, who invested

00:10:22.490 --> 00:10:25.940
in disability as early as
the early 2000s, wasn't it?

00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:27.064
I think it was--

00:10:27.065 --> 00:10:28.540
<v Anne-Mieke> Yes.

00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:33.420
<v Piccia> They were already trading
online, it was already normal--

00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:36.640
I lived in London at the time, it was
normal to do your shopping online.

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:37.410
Relatively normal.

00:10:37.410 --> 00:10:43.290
It was normal for me to do your
shopping online, but they researched

00:10:43.290 --> 00:10:47.200
what they needed to
do to get accessible.

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:49.790
When they implemented the
changes that they needed

00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:53.540
to make their sales skyrocketed.

00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:59.092
I think the return on investment
was 37,000%, Anne, was that the--

00:10:59.092 --> 00:10:59.236
<v Anne-Mieke> Yes.

00:10:59.236 --> 00:11:01.530
[chuckles]

00:11:01.530 --> 00:11:04.617
I had to run that
through a calculator

00:11:04.618 --> 00:11:07.070
because they invested £35,000,

00:11:07.070 --> 00:11:12.600
and they got £13 million
annual additional turnover.

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:14.880
I'm very naive where
calculations come from,

00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:20.200
so I would divide 30 million by
that number minus the investment,

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:22.510
and then I thought, "Oh, yes,
okay, that's really cool."

00:11:22.510 --> 00:11:26.110
Until I got it into a return
on investment calculator

00:11:26.110 --> 00:11:26.990
and I was like, "Okay."

00:11:26.990 --> 00:11:27.990
[chuckles]

00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:29.789
This is absolutely great.

00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:36.220
Now, I'm insanely happy with this
case, and I would give this case

00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:38.460
to anybody who wants to
learn about accessible

00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:43.340
and accessible webshops because
we want to demo the site

00:11:43.340 --> 00:11:45.380
or Lazar is going
to demo that site.

00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:49.540
How we would use that site because
their accessibility efforts

00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:57.460
have been focused on screenreader
users very strongly, I can tell.

00:11:57.460 --> 00:11:59.290
Of course, they're competent.

00:11:59.290 --> 00:12:02.270
They're doing things very well,
but the great thing, and this is

00:12:02.270 --> 00:12:08.790
why this is such a fantastic case,
we're also going to talk about

00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:12.280
what they could do more
to boost their turnover

00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:15.760
because they missed
a lot of corners.

00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:16.890
The site is great.

00:12:16.890 --> 00:12:20.140
Lazar is probably going to
say, "This is fantastic,

00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:22.090
I could do all my
Christmas shopping here."

00:12:22.090 --> 00:12:26.950
Although you would have to
move to the UK, [chuckles]

00:12:28.210 --> 00:12:31.130
I fear, Lazar.

00:12:31.130 --> 00:12:34.980
If they would invest in that
again, and if they would invest

00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:41.600
into the design, it would become
accessible in a much broader sense

00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:47.070
because also this is where
usability, accessibility,

00:12:47.070 --> 00:12:53.090
and being attractive
really [inaudible]

00:12:53.090 --> 00:12:56.250
because people tend to believe,
"If it has to be accessible,

00:12:56.250 --> 00:12:58.980
it can't be visually attractive."

00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:00.080
It's not true.

00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:06.586
I know we have one of the sessions
in WP Accessibility Day is about it.

00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:14.170
Lazar,
would you like to tell us more

00:13:14.170 --> 00:13:19.770
about what your experience
is like on Tesco?

00:13:19.770 --> 00:13:23.770
Have you tried to register or would
you like to show us how it works?

00:13:23.770 --> 00:13:29.520
<v Lazar> Well, since we had
a quick meeting on Friday

00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:34.300
where you basically told me
that everything should be shown

00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:37.200
for the first time, [chuckles]

00:13:38.450 --> 00:13:40.340
I will just do it.

00:13:40.340 --> 00:13:41.740
Basically Yes.

00:13:43.669 --> 00:13:48.070
<v Anne-Mieke> Do you mind
if I comment in between?

00:13:48.070 --> 00:13:51.712
So I can comment in
between why it is--

00:13:53.533 --> 00:13:54.170
<v Lazar> Just [crosstalk]

00:13:54.170 --> 00:13:58.920
<v Piccia> If you don't mind,
I might also bat in because when I--

00:13:58.920 --> 00:13:59.770
<v Lazar> [crosstalk]

00:13:59.770 --> 00:14:02.642
website It's www.

00:14:02.642 --> 00:14:06.132
[screen reader]

00:14:07.914 --> 00:14:11.280
<v Anne-Mieke> tesco.com, with a C.
Tesco.

00:14:11.730 --> 00:14:13.070
<v Lazar> T for tango?

00:14:14.153 --> 00:14:16.790
<v Anne-Mieke> E for
Edward, S for Simon.

00:14:18.725 --> 00:14:19.490
<v Lazar> C for Charlie?

00:14:20.226 --> 00:14:25.150
<v Anne-Mieke> C for
Charlie, O for open, .com.

00:14:25.150 --> 00:14:29.790
<v Lazar> [screen reader]

00:14:29.790 --> 00:14:33.130
Tesco markets super online recipe.

00:14:33.130 --> 00:14:35.006
[screen reader]

00:14:35.006 --> 00:14:36.690
<v Anne-Mieke> Can you
make that full-screen?

00:14:37.557 --> 00:14:38.214
<v Lazar> Yes.

00:14:38.214 --> 00:14:40.013
[screen reader]

00:14:41.355 --> 00:14:42.157
Do you see it now?

00:14:42.815 --> 00:14:43.290
<v Anne-Mieke> Yes.

00:14:43.290 --> 00:14:44.090
<v Piccia> Yes.

00:14:44.090 --> 00:14:48.121
<v Anne-Mieke> For me
subtitling verbally for anyone

00:14:48.121 --> 00:14:49.455
who is new to this.

00:14:50.390 --> 00:14:51.789
What you're hearing is--

00:14:51.790 --> 00:14:53.830
<v Lazar> It says you're offline.

00:14:56.030 --> 00:14:56.997
<v Anne-Mieke> You're not offline.

00:14:57.774 --> 00:14:58.680
<v Lazar> Oh God.

00:15:01.570 --> 00:15:03.872
God, they're hearing
something terrible here.

00:15:03.872 --> 00:15:05.271
[screen reader]

00:15:05.271 --> 00:15:06.672
<v Piccia> The slider.

00:15:06.672 --> 00:15:07.240
<v Lazar> Yes.

00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:16.208
[screen reader]

00:15:16.208 --> 00:15:17.940
<v Anne-Mieke> Can you
pause this for a second?

00:15:17.940 --> 00:15:22.422
<v Piccia> Show this to any client
who asks for a slider, please.

00:15:24.562 --> 00:15:25.900
<v Lazar> It speaks randomly.

00:15:27.493 --> 00:15:31.080
<v Anne-Mieke> Rule number one,
if you want to have great conversion

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:33.023
on your website [crosstalk]

00:15:33.023 --> 00:15:33.414
<v Lazar> I didn't
expect this to happen.

00:15:33.414 --> 00:15:34.000
[screen reader]

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:34.867
<v Anne-Mieke> Can you pause it?

00:15:34.867 --> 00:15:36.469
[chuckles]

00:15:40.630 --> 00:15:43.790
<v Lazar> I will now turn on
the speech so can comment.

00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:44.560
<v Anne-Mieke> Thank you.

00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:44.950
[crosstalk]

00:15:44.951 --> 00:15:46.120
<v Piccia> [chuckles]

00:15:46.801 --> 00:15:48.460
There's a few things here.

00:15:49.248 --> 00:15:52.260
First of all,
I don't know about you but to me

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:58.460
when I listened to the screen
reader at the speed that Lazar uses,

00:15:58.460 --> 00:16:00.920
it's just extraordinary.

00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:04.950
When we had that meeting,
Lazar, I was like,

00:16:04.950 --> 00:16:07.370
"Is this speaking English,
or is it--" [chuckles]

00:16:07.370 --> 00:16:11.700
I wasn't sure what language it
was, and then I did notice

00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:14.600
that there was the slider
but I don't think you did.

00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:17.590
I think maybe you were already
signed in, Lazar, maybe.

00:16:17.590 --> 00:16:18.570
You didn't [crosstalk]

00:16:18.570 --> 00:16:19.130
<v Lazar> [crosstalk]

00:16:19.130 --> 00:16:22.710
what was the trick,
but that worked correctly.

00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:25.460
Maybe they changed
something in-between anyway.

00:16:27.330 --> 00:16:29.400
I hear some crackings here.

00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:31.540
Anyway, this is what we have now.

00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:35.521
[cracking sound]

00:16:35.521 --> 00:16:56.040
<v Anne-Mieke> [inaudible]

00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:58.320
<v Piccia> Anne,
we can't hear you that well.

00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:00.286
<v Lazar> We hear some cracking.

00:17:03.523 --> 00:17:04.880
<v Piccia> I don't know if it's
you, Anne.

00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:07.230
Try and mute yourself,
then we'll check if it's you.

00:17:09.710 --> 00:17:11.560
Yes, it is you.

00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:11.910
Sorry.

00:17:11.910 --> 00:17:13.735
[chuckles]

00:17:13.735 --> 00:17:16.010
<v Anne-Mieke> I hear
you crackling like crazy.

00:17:16.010 --> 00:17:17.640
<v Piccia> You're fine now.

00:17:18.144 --> 00:17:19.071
<v Anne-Mieke> I'm fine now?

00:17:19.071 --> 00:17:19.572
Okay.

00:17:19.572 --> 00:17:20.006
<v Lazar> Yes.

00:17:20.006 --> 00:17:20.250
<v Piccia> Yes.

00:17:20.250 --> 00:17:21.340
It's gone now.

00:17:21.340 --> 00:17:22.775
It's gone.

00:17:25.393 --> 00:17:30.730
<v Anne-Mieke> Really,
even if it is coded correctly,

00:17:30.730 --> 00:17:36.360
and it has aria labels and all of
it, this is actually

00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:41.470
being over-programmed,
in my opinion, even the speed.

00:17:41.470 --> 00:17:45.970
For anybody who can see, he can see
the speed of this slider is crazy.

00:17:45.970 --> 00:17:49.970
Now, I don't know anyone who
is going to sit at his screen

00:17:49.970 --> 00:17:54.000
and watch what is on that slider.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:57.400
This is horrific for
people who can see

00:17:57.400 --> 00:18:00.280
and for people using screen
readers and for people

00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:05.050
with cognitive issues like I do,
I am ADHD on steroids every day.

00:18:05.050 --> 00:18:10.190
This would make me
jump out of my skin.

00:18:10.190 --> 00:18:12.460
Now, to a possible solution.

00:18:12.460 --> 00:18:20.666
People, if you really wish to use
something on your page that changes,

00:18:21.670 --> 00:18:29.610
don't use a slider, create a post
that changes every two minutes

00:18:29.610 --> 00:18:34.510
because you are the one who has
to entice your potential buyer

00:18:34.510 --> 00:18:37.620
to return every now
and then to come back.

00:18:39.910 --> 00:18:41.390
That would be nice, wouldn't it?

00:18:41.390 --> 00:18:44.370
If you come back the next
day and it suddenly says,

00:18:44.370 --> 00:18:48.170
"Oh, today we have this," and
an hour later they come back,

00:18:48.170 --> 00:18:55.450
"Oh, today,--" and we also have
that, you would achieve more by that.

00:18:55.450 --> 00:19:00.373
Now, Piccia, do you have any comments
or improvement advice on this one?

00:19:00.373 --> 00:19:01.941
<v Piccia> Yes.

00:19:02.190 --> 00:19:03.420
Just don't do it.

00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:08.600
I am not diagnosed with anything
in particular and I'm motion sick

00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:10.420
because this slider has been going.

00:19:11.550 --> 00:19:16.490
Basically, have one call to
action, just decide.

00:19:16.490 --> 00:19:19.180
A slider is also indecisive.

00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:22.750
It means that you're not
sure what you want to offer.

00:19:22.750 --> 00:19:26.438
Here we have now Call of
Duty and Reducing your risk

00:19:26.439 --> 00:19:27.830
of type 2 diabetes.

00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:29.100
Who are you talking to?

00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:30.480
Who is your audience?

00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:35.440
It's like they don't know
anymore who they want to attract.

00:19:36.510 --> 00:19:39.190
We know that it's a
big part of your act

00:19:39.190 --> 00:19:43.080
to just have one
clear call to action.

00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:47.150
You can change it every day
if you have more than one type

00:19:47.150 --> 00:19:49.350
of audience but don't do this.

00:19:50.970 --> 00:19:52.690
What are you going to converse?

00:19:52.690 --> 00:19:56.595
It's hardly there long enough for
me to actually read and then click

00:19:56.595 --> 00:19:57.396
on the button.

00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:04.000
Anyway, Lazar,
let's go back to your experience.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:04.210
[chuckles]

00:20:04.210 --> 00:20:04.940
<v Lazar> Wow.

00:20:04.940 --> 00:20:09.910
To be honest, I didn't expect
this to happen as I told you.

00:20:09.910 --> 00:20:12.400
<v Anne-Mieke> I did [inaudible]

00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:16.550
<v Lazar> Anyway, especially
when I heard your story, Anne.

00:20:18.284 --> 00:20:20.360
I don't know what to think
about this at the moment,

00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:25.190
but what I can say now
if this works like this,

00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:29.630
like what we have seen now,
I can be very confident

00:20:29.630 --> 00:20:34.510
to say that online shopping on this
website would be terrible here.

00:20:34.510 --> 00:20:38.340
I don't say it would be
impossible, but that will be

00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:41.740
much more difficult than expected.

00:20:41.740 --> 00:20:47.230
What I can do now is I can show
you the website, it's a store.

00:20:47.230 --> 00:20:49.990
It's a specially designed
store for the blind.

00:20:49.990 --> 00:20:55.970
They sell special
aides and equipment.

00:20:55.970 --> 00:20:58.239
Maybe that can improve
the impression,

00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:00.530
so you can see what's like
to be [crosstalk]

00:21:00.530 --> 00:21:02.010
<v Anne-Mieke> Yes,
Lazar [crosstalk]

00:21:02.010 --> 00:21:06.830
<v Piccia> Can I ask-- sorry,
Anne, I didn't mean to interrupt,

00:21:06.830 --> 00:21:11.320
I'm really curious though,
to know from you, Lazar,

00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:16.330
when you realize that there's a
slider that's not even saying things

00:21:16.330 --> 00:21:20.860
that make any sense, how easy
is it for you to skip it to go

00:21:20.860 --> 00:21:22.620
to the content that
you're interested in?

00:21:22.620 --> 00:21:24.316
<v Lazar> It's very difficult.

00:21:24.316 --> 00:21:25.970
<v Piccia> Is it?

00:21:25.970 --> 00:21:28.840
<v Lazar> I don't know
if it's even possible.

00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:33.450
Especially if the slides are
changing on every link I clicked,

00:21:33.450 --> 00:21:39.290
and also depends on frequency
because I think it happened

00:21:39.290 --> 00:21:45.220
on previous events that we tested
one more website with similar issue.

00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:47.520
Anne can remember that.

00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:49.608
<v Anne-Mieke> Yes,
we also remember that.

00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:54.620
One of the reasons I would still
like to stay on this website is

00:21:54.620 --> 00:21:57.190
because there are
more things going on.

00:21:57.190 --> 00:22:00.710
I really don't mean
to hit on Tesco.

00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:03.950
If anyone from Tesco is
watching this or not, I'm going

00:22:03.950 --> 00:22:06.270
to send the video to
you people because-

00:22:06.270 --> 00:22:06.860
<v Lazar> Definitely.

00:22:06.860 --> 00:22:11.220
<v Anne-Mieke> -they did a
fantastic job 20 years ago,

00:22:11.220 --> 00:22:25.028
they enable all of us nowadays
to say to customers [inaudible]

00:22:25.028 --> 00:22:26.979
<v Piccia> You're crackling
again, Anne.

00:22:26.979 --> 00:22:30.517
<v Anne-Mieke> [inaudible]

00:22:30.517 --> 00:22:31.650
<v Piccia> Let's try again.

00:22:31.650 --> 00:22:34.750
<v Anne-Mieke> Okay,
let's try [inaudible]

00:22:34.750 --> 00:22:36.310
<v Piccia> Still happening.

00:22:36.310 --> 00:22:44.799
<v Anne-Mieke> [inaudible]

00:22:44.799 --> 00:22:46.840
<v Piccia> It's still
happening, I don't know why.

00:22:47.650 --> 00:22:52.710
In the meantime, Anne, I'm going
to say what I think you want.

00:22:52.710 --> 00:22:54.673
[chuckles]

00:22:54.673 --> 00:22:57.750
You want to still try Tesco.

00:22:57.750 --> 00:23:05.160
I guess now the point is how do
you, Lazar, circumvent the slider

00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:08.370
and actually get into
the navigation maybe?

00:23:08.370 --> 00:23:09.340
Are you able to do that?

00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:18.186
<v Lazar> [screen reader]

00:23:18.186 --> 00:23:21.166
I have to be faster
than slide changing.

00:23:21.166 --> 00:23:22.201
<v Piccia> Right.

00:23:22.201 --> 00:23:22.768
Okay.

00:23:22.768 --> 00:23:23.636
Wow.

00:23:23.636 --> 00:23:27.777
<v Lazar> [screen reader]

00:23:27.777 --> 00:23:35.160
recipes [screen reader]

00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:39.320
I have to be very fast because
otherwise, it's [inaudible]

00:23:39.321 --> 00:23:43.670
<v Piccia> Because we
were going to ask you

00:23:43.670 --> 00:23:51.000
to maybe slow the screen reader
down now that we've demonstrated

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:52.770
how fast to use it.

00:23:52.770 --> 00:23:55.810
Again, you can't do it because
otherwise, you can't beat the slider.

00:23:55.810 --> 00:23:59.520
<v Lazar> It's about the pace
sliding start changing and

00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:02.930
if you ask me what
would be the solution,

00:24:03.970 --> 00:24:07.320
maybe they could just add a
simple shortcut at the beginning

00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:13.420
of the website, so I can press
something simple like I'll press one

00:24:13.420 --> 00:24:16.300
then that could exclude
changing those slides.

00:24:18.970 --> 00:24:21.300
Everything else could stay the
same, I think.

00:24:21.300 --> 00:24:30.302
<v Anne-Mieke> [inaudible]

00:24:30.302 --> 00:24:31.920
<v Piccia> Anne,
it's just still not.

00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:39.090
You were saying here in the chat
that accessibility is a verb,

00:24:39.090 --> 00:24:41.860
it does not stop basically.

00:24:41.860 --> 00:24:47.286
<v Anne-Mieke> [inaudible]

00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:51.670
<v Piccia> It's still it's
really crackling, Anne.

00:24:58.000 --> 00:24:59.340
You're sparkling.

00:25:01.734 --> 00:25:03.010
<v Lazar> It's like old records.

00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:08.590
Now you're muted.

00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:19.640
Maybe she can type her comments
in the chat and you can read it

00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:22.260
to both of us, so we can comment.

00:25:24.590 --> 00:25:25.870
<v Piccia> Do you want
to try and do that?

00:25:25.870 --> 00:25:30.300
Maybe go out and come in again.

00:25:30.300 --> 00:25:33.999
<v Anne-Mieke> I have
switched the connection.

00:25:34.633 --> 00:25:35.199
<v Lazar> That works.

00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:35.660
<v Piccia> Okay.

00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:36.660
Oh, that sounds good.

00:25:36.660 --> 00:25:39.560
<v Anne-Mieke> It was the
connection, not my AirPods.

00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:46.740
Now, what I really wanted to
say is accessibility is a verb,

00:25:46.740 --> 00:25:53.690
it means this has been created
a long time ago, but to me,

00:25:53.690 --> 00:25:58.200
it feels like it
did not [inaudible]

00:25:59.350 --> 00:26:01.680
This is what I was trying to say.

00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:04.820
Keep thinking about how
you can evolve [inaudible]

00:26:11.890 --> 00:26:15.100
<v Piccia> Lazar,
she's now freezed.

00:26:16.620 --> 00:26:17.670
Anne has now freezed.

00:26:17.670 --> 00:26:18.950
[chuckles]

00:26:18.950 --> 00:26:20.020
She's frozen now.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.440
She's in Switzerland,
that's the Alps.

00:26:25.540 --> 00:26:29.870
One thing I wanted to ask you,
Lazar is, I can see at the top

00:26:29.870 --> 00:26:34.240
of your screen you have
the cookies notice.

00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:34.940
<v Lazar> Oh, yes.

00:26:34.940 --> 00:26:36.640
<v Piccia> You see you saw that?

00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:38.831
<v Lazar> I think--

00:26:38.831 --> 00:26:39.700
<v Piccia> You heard that.

00:26:39.700 --> 00:26:41.358
chuckles]

00:26:41.358 --> 00:26:44.890
<v Lazar> Look, basically,
this is very, very difficult

00:26:44.890 --> 00:26:49.860
because when you have
this slider moving around,

00:26:49.860 --> 00:26:52.700
everything becomes
literally a nightmare.

00:26:52.700 --> 00:26:55.820
I guess maybe there
is, maybe there is not,

00:26:55.820 --> 00:27:00.060
but when they change so
rapidly, I will tell you

00:27:00.060 --> 00:27:03.940
that I can't visit this
website, and I cannot interact

00:27:03.940 --> 00:27:05.460
with the website properly.

00:27:05.460 --> 00:27:06.790
Maybe some users could.

00:27:07.910 --> 00:27:08.560
[chuckles]

00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:13.180
In my case,
that's not possible at least today.

00:27:13.180 --> 00:27:15.660
This is what will happen.

00:27:15.660 --> 00:27:16.480
<v Piccia> That's incredible.

00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:21.400
<v Lazar> Yes, but I would be
happy to simply have a chat,

00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:25.890
so if anyone from Tesco is here,
or anyone else who is available

00:27:25.890 --> 00:27:29.370
to connect us with them, I'll be
more than happy to chat with them

00:27:29.370 --> 00:27:31.410
and just show them
what happens here.

00:27:31.410 --> 00:27:34.510
<v Piccia> You're not able to even
pause this slider, there's no way

00:27:34.510 --> 00:27:36.040
for you to pause the slider?

00:27:37.456 --> 00:27:39.090
<v Lazar> Is there a button?

00:27:39.090 --> 00:27:40.640
<v Piccia> There is a button, yes.

00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:42.327
I can see that there is a button.

00:27:42.327 --> 00:27:44.767
<v Lazar> [screen reader]

00:27:44.767 --> 00:27:45.697
Pause code.

00:27:45.697 --> 00:28:02.948
[screen reader]

00:28:02.948 --> 00:28:04.580
Where is the button
to pause the slide?

00:28:07.352 --> 00:28:13.590
<v Piccia> Backward, there's
a slide that you're on, a dot

00:28:13.590 --> 00:28:17.260
that signifies which slide you're
on, and there's a forward,

00:28:17.260 --> 00:28:19.531
and then there's a pause button.

00:28:19.531 --> 00:28:24.870
[screen reader]

00:28:24.870 --> 00:28:27.570
Because otherwise,
I'm thinking that--

00:28:29.139 --> 00:28:31.950
<v Lazar> I think it's very difficult
to find this button actually.

00:28:31.950 --> 00:28:34.840
<v Anne-Mieke> Amber
says try two tabs.

00:28:36.196 --> 00:28:38.966
<v Lazar> [screen reader]

00:28:40.210 --> 00:28:43.140
To open another tab
with this website?

00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:45.010
<v Anne-Mieke> No,
using the tab key.

00:28:45.010 --> 00:28:46.290
<v Lazar> Okay, I'm doing that.

00:28:46.290 --> 00:28:47.170
<v Anne-Mieke> Two more?

00:28:47.170 --> 00:28:49.650
<v Lazar> Tesco magazine.

00:28:49.650 --> 00:28:57.090
Delivery saver, sign in, register,
reducing the risk, diabetes.

00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:02.810
Viewing one of free items,
maybe that's a slide show.

00:29:02.810 --> 00:29:04.020
Shop for Christmas.

00:29:05.140 --> 00:29:09.370
Go backward to previous
kiosk, go forward.

00:29:09.370 --> 00:29:10.510
<v Piccia> That's it.

00:29:10.510 --> 00:29:11.510
You're on it.

00:29:11.510 --> 00:29:13.197
[screen reader]

00:29:13.197 --> 00:29:13.752
Yes.

00:29:15.821 --> 00:29:16.588
<v Lazar> Yes.

00:29:19.750 --> 00:29:27.700
This solution is a bit-- why
you just do a quick shortcut,

00:29:27.700 --> 00:29:28.830
that was click this button.

00:29:28.830 --> 00:29:33.639
<v Piccia> We have a good question
in fact, from the audience

00:29:34.130 --> 00:29:37.990
that what is the best solution
to make a slider accessible

00:29:37.990 --> 00:29:40.170
if the client insists on it?

00:29:40.170 --> 00:29:44.230
They're asking make it manual, or
slow down the autoplay significantly.

00:29:44.230 --> 00:29:46.285
If you make it manual,
I can guarantee

00:29:46.285 --> 00:29:49.150
that very few people are going
to go through it.

00:29:49.150 --> 00:29:51.020
What would be your
suggestion, Lazar?

00:29:51.020 --> 00:29:53.010
The shortcuts as you were saying.

00:29:53.010 --> 00:29:55.960
<v Lazar> The shortcut at the
beginning that would allow me

00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:58.560
to toggle slider off and on.

00:29:59.198 --> 00:30:00.130
<v Piccia> Okay.

00:30:00.130 --> 00:30:02.000
That's the best solution-

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:02.950
<v Lazar> Yes, I think so.

00:30:02.950 --> 00:30:04.260
<v Piccia> -to make it accessible.

00:30:04.260 --> 00:30:07.670
Basically, disabling the
slider is making it accessible.

00:30:07.670 --> 00:30:11.880
That just tells you that a
slider just isn't accessible.

00:30:13.090 --> 00:30:15.590
<v Anne-Mieke> I was going to
talk about the focus states

00:30:15.590 --> 00:30:21.540
in this site in general at a
later stage because for the people

00:30:21.540 --> 00:30:23.443
who use keyboard navigation,

00:30:23.444 --> 00:30:26.570
we couldn't help you
because we couldn't see

00:30:26.570 --> 00:30:32.040
where you were because the focus
state was not visible to us.

00:30:33.098 --> 00:30:34.910
<v Lazar> Oh, yes,
that's a different layout.

00:30:34.910 --> 00:30:39.610
<v Anne-Mieke> This makes
it difficult, to begin with.

00:30:39.610 --> 00:30:44.970
Another tip, if you want to
increase your conversion,

00:30:44.970 --> 00:30:46.940
make sure you have
a great focus state.

00:30:46.940 --> 00:30:52.130
Now, one of the dangers in our
profession is that we assume

00:30:52.130 --> 00:30:55.360
that everybody knows what
focus state actually is.

00:30:56.370 --> 00:30:59.650
Now, you probably have
installed [inaudible]

00:30:59.650 --> 00:31:03.480
and then you go to the
same support and say,

00:31:03.480 --> 00:31:08.680
"I don't like those lines around my
menu items, how can I remove those?"

00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:12.980
There are people that
can see your focus state.

00:31:12.980 --> 00:31:16.880
Focus state is becoming active.

00:31:18.390 --> 00:31:24.820
When something becomes focusable,
links are focusable elements,

00:31:24.820 --> 00:31:27.780
buttons are focusable elements.

00:31:27.780 --> 00:31:35.530
If you do not like the lines around
a focusable item, then style it,

00:31:35.530 --> 00:31:39.460
and make sure that your
styling is accessible.

00:31:39.460 --> 00:31:42.407
Which means it has great contrast,

00:31:42.408 --> 00:31:47.910
and that the styling is not
interfering with anything else.

00:31:47.910 --> 00:31:52.830
It just has to be very clear because
this, of course, is dramatic.

00:31:52.830 --> 00:31:55.570
People who are depending
on a screen reader,

00:31:55.570 --> 00:31:58.760
and then ask someone else,
"Can you please help me?"

00:31:58.760 --> 00:32:04.310
We can't help because not even us can
see where the screen reader is at.

00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:08.110
This will boost your conversions.

00:32:10.810 --> 00:32:15.470
Now that we have managed it
past this horrible slider,

00:32:15.470 --> 00:32:18.590
and, of course, someone asked
what is the best solution

00:32:18.590 --> 00:32:21.560
to make a carousel
slider accessible.

00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:29.540
Sorry, as far as I know, there is
no comfortable accessible slider.

00:32:29.540 --> 00:32:32.090
Maybe you should tell
your client that.

00:32:32.090 --> 00:32:37.060
It's like, you go into a shop
and there's this bad smell,

00:32:37.060 --> 00:32:41.080
someone stepped in dog poop
before you or the sewer is bad,

00:32:41.080 --> 00:32:45.310
or whatever, and it's not
really some conscious thing.

00:32:45.310 --> 00:32:47.480
You were in this store
and you're standing there

00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:50.980
and your brain starts
churning and it's like,

00:32:50.980 --> 00:32:52.600
"Maybe I can get
this somewhere else.

00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:53.990
Yes, no,
I'm not going to stay here.

00:32:53.990 --> 00:32:55.690
I can do this some other day."

00:32:55.690 --> 00:32:57.710
Boom, the customer is gone.

00:32:57.710 --> 00:33:03.470
This is the same thing
with accessible sliders.

00:33:03.470 --> 00:33:07.950
Of course, you can turn
off things like autoplay,

00:33:07.950 --> 00:33:12.400
but I sincerely believe
if you're asking me,

00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:16.610
"How do I boost conversions in
my webshop?" The answer would be,

00:33:16.610 --> 00:33:19.110
do not use a slider.

00:33:19.110 --> 00:33:23.900
Not using autoplay could
be a possible solution.

00:33:23.900 --> 00:33:28.050
Someone has to be able to skip past
something like this really fast.

00:33:28.050 --> 00:33:33.470
<v Lazar> Facebook has a very tiny
and quality solution for this.

00:33:33.470 --> 00:33:34.990
When you just mentioned autoplay.

00:33:37.330 --> 00:33:42.590
On page, whether you are using
a web browser or a phone app,

00:33:44.490 --> 00:33:47.720
they never play the
video if they recognize

00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:50.420
that the screen view is turned on.

00:33:50.420 --> 00:33:55.950
As soon as the video starts,
you just need to double-click

00:33:55.950 --> 00:33:59.020
and click on mute.

00:34:00.338 --> 00:34:03.890
<v Anne-Mieke> Is this in
the Facebook website or is it

00:34:03.890 --> 00:34:04.970
in the Facebook app?

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.400
<v Lazar> Both cases.

00:34:09.848 --> 00:34:10.690
<v Anne-Mieke> That's wonderful.

00:34:11.249 --> 00:34:12.610
<v Piccia> That's really good.

00:34:12.610 --> 00:34:17.740
<v Lazar> On LinkedIn, for example,
you have to toggle this setting.

00:34:20.850 --> 00:34:22.750
<v Piccia> One thing that
I'm interested in now

00:34:22.750 --> 00:34:28.310
that we are finally in,
the slider has stopped.

00:34:28.310 --> 00:34:34.220
Can we now see, Lazar, if you were
to do your Christmas shopping,

00:34:34.220 --> 00:34:36.740
how difficult it gets from here?

00:34:36.740 --> 00:34:39.244
<v Lazar> Let's see what we can do.

00:34:39.244 --> 00:34:46.084
I pressed Ctrl + Home to move to
the beginning of the web page.

00:34:46.084 --> 00:34:48.553
[screen reader]

00:34:48.553 --> 00:34:50.600
We use cookies.

00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:57.262
[screen reader]

00:34:57.990 --> 00:35:01.270
Let's see if this combo box
is accessible here, select.

00:35:01.270 --> 00:35:02.890
[screen reader]

00:35:02.890 --> 00:35:04.440
Yes, that works.

00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:07.450
<v Anne-Mieke> We can't see
what combo box you're on.

00:35:07.450 --> 00:35:08.510
<v Piccia> I can see it.

00:35:08.510 --> 00:35:09.820
<v Anne-Mieke> You can see it?

00:35:09.820 --> 00:35:10.030
Okay.

00:35:10.030 --> 00:35:10.520
<v Piccia> Yes.

00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:15.246
It's the drop-down on the top
right next door to the search.

00:35:15.246 --> 00:35:17.127
[screen reader]

00:35:17.127 --> 00:35:18.717
You can see it's changing.

00:35:19.809 --> 00:35:23.610
[screen reader]

00:35:25.810 --> 00:35:28.240
Technically,
how do you make this accessible?

00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:30.800
How do you make a drop-down
accessible for our audience?

00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:34.340
<v Lazar> Basically, your
press, in my case, let's say

00:35:34.340 --> 00:35:38.460
that this is not my first
time visiting this website,

00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:40.830
so I pressed C [screen reader]

00:35:40.830 --> 00:35:44.820
to move to the next combo
box, and then I press enter

00:35:44.820 --> 00:35:49.950
to open it up,
and the menu should appear.

00:35:49.950 --> 00:35:53.500
Then I move down and up,
recipes, and then press enter.

00:35:53.500 --> 00:35:54.000
[screen reader]

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:55.800
It says again, the recipes.

00:35:55.800 --> 00:35:58.180
I can press tab [screen reader]

00:35:58.180 --> 00:36:00.992
and select,
select combo box recipes.

00:36:00.992 --> 00:36:03.774
[screen reader]

00:36:03.774 --> 00:36:10.913
You probably can press
Enter here [screen reader]

00:36:10.913 --> 00:36:12.860
and search.

00:36:12.860 --> 00:36:14.706
<v Piccia> You're in
the search box now.

00:36:15.774 --> 00:36:19.372
[screen reader]

00:36:19.373 --> 00:36:21.020
Enter doesn't help.

00:36:21.020 --> 00:36:33.200
[screen reader]

00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:40.670
<v Lazar> It sounds like
it's-- [screen reader]

00:36:46.137 --> 00:36:48.790
<v Piccia> What you're trying
to do is that actually going

00:36:48.790 --> 00:36:49.860
to the selections?

00:36:49.860 --> 00:36:50.875
<v Lazar> Select grocery.

00:36:52.350 --> 00:36:56.140
<v Piccia> You're on groceries,
but if you press enter,

00:36:56.140 --> 00:36:58.670
it should take you there,
and it's not taking you there.

00:36:58.670 --> 00:36:59.760
Is that what's happening?

00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:01.052
<v Lazar> Yes.

00:37:01.810 --> 00:37:02.810
[screen reader]

00:37:03.540 --> 00:37:05.400
Club card, [screen reader]

00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:07.350
enter and it's selected.

00:37:07.350 --> 00:37:10.695
[screen reader]

00:37:10.695 --> 00:37:11.670
<v Piccia> We can't.

00:37:11.670 --> 00:37:13.720
We're in another dead, basically.

00:37:16.311 --> 00:37:21.060
<v Anne-Mieke> I think we
have sufficiently demonstrated

00:37:21.060 --> 00:37:21.870
that even a store--

00:37:21.870 --> 00:37:22.700
<v Lazar> Thank you, Anne.

00:37:22.700 --> 00:37:24.509
[chucles]

00:37:24.509 --> 00:37:29.490
<v Anne-Mieke> I think even a
store, and we haven't even gone

00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:33.840
through the process of trying
to register or buy something,

00:37:35.940 --> 00:37:43.070
even for me as a part-time
keyboard user, I have information

00:37:43.070 --> 00:37:47.630
in my right arm, which forces me
to navigate sites by keyboard.

00:37:47.630 --> 00:37:50.770
Also, for me, this site was
an incredible challenge.

00:37:53.400 --> 00:37:59.660
That's the same like you're going
into a store and everything is

00:37:59.660 --> 00:38:02.340
on the top shelf,
and you can't reach it.

00:38:04.460 --> 00:38:08.990
Making your site accessible
or your webshop accessible

00:38:08.990 --> 00:38:12.640
will boost conversions in general.

00:38:12.640 --> 00:38:14.592
Where are you going now, Lazar?

00:38:14.592 --> 00:38:17.920
<v Piccia> Yes, because we're
not able to do anything here.

00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:20.810
<v Lazar> Recipes,
it sounds like it's selected.

00:38:20.810 --> 00:38:21.300
No?

00:38:21.300 --> 00:38:21.580
[screen reader]

00:38:21.580 --> 00:38:22.830
<v Piccia> Yes, it is selected.

00:38:22.830 --> 00:38:25.100
<v Lazar> Basically,
here's the trick.

00:38:25.100 --> 00:38:27.005
[screen reader]

00:38:27.320 --> 00:38:29.380
You have to open the
combo box [screen reader]

00:38:29.380 --> 00:38:34.090
the cabins and then
press Alt plus down arrow

00:38:34.090 --> 00:38:39.790
because any weird command to expand
the combo box [screen reader]

00:38:39.790 --> 00:38:41.280
and then let's say club card.

00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:43.330
[screen reader]

00:38:43.330 --> 00:38:44.622
It should be selected now.

00:38:44.622 --> 00:38:46.324
<v Piccia> Yes, it is.

00:38:46.958 --> 00:38:49.200
<v Lazar> This is
how it works here.

00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:53.700
This combo box is accessible,
I would say with a bit

00:38:53.700 --> 00:38:56.510
of screen reader knowledge.

00:38:56.510 --> 00:39:02.330
<v Anne-Mieke> Here's the
thing, Lazar I grew up with it.

00:39:02.330 --> 00:39:06.740
<v Lazar> Sorry, Anne, but that's
a triggering question for me.

00:39:07.980 --> 00:39:11.440
What are the
accessibility criterias?

00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:15.020
Because I'm quite sure that
after we disabled slides,

00:39:15.020 --> 00:39:21.350
and they were able to select
the recipes or to use combo box

00:39:21.350 --> 00:39:27.800
with a bit of knowledge, this
website is pretty much accessible.

00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:31.070
I could order from here somehow.

00:39:31.070 --> 00:39:39.460
What is the criteria when we say
this is accessible or if it's not?

00:39:39.460 --> 00:39:43.190
<v Anne-Mieke> That's
quite a number of criteria.

00:39:45.730 --> 00:39:51.830
That would, of course, be for you
to use it, it should be usable.

00:39:51.830 --> 00:39:52.320
I'm sorry.

00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:54.058
Is there someone here
in the background?

00:39:54.058 --> 00:39:54.530
<v Lazar> No.

00:39:54.530 --> 00:39:55.530
<v Anne-Mieke> Excuse me.

00:39:58.496 --> 00:40:00.565
I'm sorry, just a second.

00:40:09.789 --> 00:40:12.130
<v Piccia> Don't you feel,
Lazar, that you were made to go

00:40:12.130 --> 00:40:17.148
through unnecessarily
rings of fire in order

00:40:17.148 --> 00:40:18.610
to get to a point where you--

00:40:19.374 --> 00:40:23.310
<v Lazar> If I would be on my
own, let's say that I'm--

00:40:23.310 --> 00:40:26.880
first I don't think I would
be able to disable the slide.

00:40:27.725 --> 00:40:30.980
<v Piccia> Also why would you,
you'd just go somewhere else.

00:40:30.980 --> 00:40:33.570
<v Lazar> Definitely,
but combo box is quite doable

00:40:35.100 --> 00:40:36.710
because I had those cases,

00:40:36.711 --> 00:40:39.620
but disabling the slide
would not be possible

00:40:39.620 --> 00:40:41.720
without sighted assistance.

00:40:41.720 --> 00:40:43.640
<v Piccia> There you go.

00:40:43.640 --> 00:40:44.500
That's great.

00:40:44.500 --> 00:40:45.890
That's extraordinary.

00:40:45.890 --> 00:40:50.530
<v Anne-Mieke> Now, really,
as much as I love your question,

00:40:50.530 --> 00:40:53.220
Lazar,
I think if we get into what kind

00:40:53.220 --> 00:40:56.430
of criteria would make a
site accessible, I think all

00:40:56.430 --> 00:40:59.480
of WP Accessibility
Day is about that.

00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:04.880
There's tons of information to find
about it and to share about it,

00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:12.120
but I think that the main goal of
today is actually to talk about

00:41:12.120 --> 00:41:19.300
how web shops can do better to
talk to address more people.

00:41:19.300 --> 00:41:23.380
Of course,
being accessible to anybody is one

00:41:23.380 --> 00:41:25.860
of the most important things.

00:41:25.860 --> 00:41:30.310
I always find it difficult
when I speak to people

00:41:30.310 --> 00:41:34.340
who are fully blind like you
are because we're talking about,

00:41:34.340 --> 00:41:36.660
you have to make it
visually attractive.

00:41:36.660 --> 00:41:38.470
To you, that's like, "Yes, sure.

00:41:38.470 --> 00:41:41.970
I don't know what
you're talking about."

00:41:41.970 --> 00:41:44.420
I think I would like to
compare that to smell.

00:41:44.420 --> 00:41:47.730
If you're passing
by three restaurants

00:41:47.730 --> 00:41:50.480
and they are all
selling the same dishes,

00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:56.280
and restaurant number 1
doesn't really smell that good,

00:41:56.280 --> 00:41:57.640
you're going to walk by.

00:41:58.740 --> 00:42:04.090
If in restaurant number 2 with
the same kind of menu has a lot

00:42:04.090 --> 00:42:06.680
of noise,
you don't want to be sitting there.

00:42:06.680 --> 00:42:07.680
Nobody does.

00:42:08.500 --> 00:42:13.080
Then you come at the third restaurant
and there is nice background music

00:42:13.080 --> 00:42:16.370
and their smells from the
kitchen are delicious.

00:42:18.470 --> 00:42:25.460
That's where people go and that's
where they leave their money.

00:42:25.460 --> 00:42:30.300
<v Piccia> I think that now
it would be really interesting

00:42:30.300 --> 00:42:33.410
to see Lazar's favorite site.

00:42:33.410 --> 00:42:40.650
Because I think that brings out
a very interesting aspect of it

00:42:40.650 --> 00:42:41.990
that we commented on.

00:42:41.990 --> 00:42:44.730
I think it would be really
great to see that now, Lazar,

00:42:44.730 --> 00:42:46.800
your favorite site to shop.

00:42:46.800 --> 00:42:49.590
<v Lazar> Is it the
store or another one?

00:42:49.590 --> 00:42:51.630
<v Piccia> I can't remember.

00:42:51.630 --> 00:42:52.490
Which one was it?

00:42:52.490 --> 00:42:53.010
Do you remember?

00:42:53.010 --> 00:42:56.850
The one that you feel like is the
most wonderfully accessible site

00:42:56.850 --> 00:42:57.420
for you [inaudible]

00:42:57.420 --> 00:42:58.420
<v Anne-Mieke> The Braille Store.

00:42:59.030 --> 00:43:02.200
<v Lazar> Oh, yes,
I saw that on the previous session.

00:43:02.200 --> 00:43:10.170
Sorry if you are going to hear
and see the same thing twice

00:43:10.170 --> 00:43:11.890
for those who are watching this.

00:43:13.830 --> 00:43:17.500
That's a blind help
project, there is no doubt.

00:43:17.500 --> 00:43:21.970
[screen reader]

00:43:21.970 --> 00:43:25.002
Visioning a brighter tomorrow
for the lens of technology.

00:43:25.002 --> 00:43:26.471
Good afternoon.

00:43:26.471 --> 00:43:29.211
[screen reader]

00:43:29.790 --> 00:43:31.050
Then there is a search.

00:43:32.930 --> 00:43:34.730
See, no next combo box.

00:43:34.730 --> 00:43:35.510
[screen reader]

00:43:35.510 --> 00:43:39.360
E, search edit, no next edit field.

00:43:39.360 --> 00:43:44.455
[screen reader]

00:43:44.455 --> 00:43:45.550
Software.

00:43:46.620 --> 00:43:48.170
Check out this combo box.

00:43:48.170 --> 00:43:51.070
I press C and I press enter.

00:43:51.070 --> 00:43:55.038
[screen reader]

00:43:55.038 --> 00:43:56.100
<v Piccia> Super easy.

00:43:56.100 --> 00:44:07.679
[screen reader]

00:44:07.679 --> 00:44:10.540
Lazar, if I may bat in.

00:44:10.540 --> 00:44:13.160
The thing that we
found so interesting

00:44:13.160 --> 00:44:18.420
about this site is that Lazar
adores it because it makes your life

00:44:18.420 --> 00:44:23.590
so easy, but for us, as we look at
it, we find it quite problematic.

00:44:23.590 --> 00:44:27.590
It's got contrast issues,
it's got big layout issues,

00:44:27.590 --> 00:44:30.480
it's got typography issues.

00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:34.920
For us to pass this visually,
those of us who use vision

00:44:34.920 --> 00:44:41.350
as our first way of interpreting
a website, it's not an easy site,

00:44:41.350 --> 00:44:43.480
but the thing is the
Blind Help project.

00:44:43.480 --> 00:44:47.680
It's not for us really,
but I thought it was so interesting

00:44:48.686 --> 00:44:50.888
because Lazar told us, "Do you want

00:44:50.888 --> 00:44:53.870
to see the most
accessible best site?"

00:44:53.870 --> 00:44:59.540
He took us here and we were
like, "This is not accessible."

00:44:59.540 --> 00:45:03.410
It's really interesting and so
much food for thought I feel

00:45:03.410 --> 00:45:09.490
in looking at something like this
and I am actually using the verb look

00:45:09.490 --> 00:45:10.330
on purpose.

00:45:10.330 --> 00:45:15.188
[screen reader]

00:45:15.188 --> 00:45:18.020
<v Anne-Mieke> What's really
interesting about this,

00:45:18.020 --> 00:45:21.860
we've discussed this is we've
seen this website before.

00:45:21.860 --> 00:45:28.280
If I wanted to do a blind person
a big favor and say buy something

00:45:28.280 --> 00:45:32.070
for his or her,
or their birthday, I would ask,

00:45:32.070 --> 00:45:33.930
"What are your favorite products?"

00:45:33.930 --> 00:45:37.460
If Lazar would tell me, "Oh,
those products are on this website,"

00:45:37.460 --> 00:45:44.910
I would have to go
there and remember that

00:45:44.910 --> 00:45:49.130
this site has been technically
designed for someone who is blind.

00:45:49.130 --> 00:45:53.500
Now imagine, and this is again
with the comparison of the smell

00:45:53.500 --> 00:46:00.020
in the restaurants, if this website
could have a big commercial interest

00:46:00.020 --> 00:46:05.070
in selling more products,
so their products get spread more

00:46:05.070 --> 00:46:08.810
and more people are being
helped by using these products.

00:46:08.810 --> 00:46:16.650
It would help if the website
was also visually attractive.

00:46:16.650 --> 00:46:21.320
This is always that
topic where we have,

00:46:21.320 --> 00:46:26.640
if that's a correct expression
about technically fully accessible

00:46:26.640 --> 00:46:31.530
or usable or attractive or
all of it at the same time,

00:46:31.530 --> 00:46:34.240
because it's incredibly
attractive to Lazar, right?

00:46:39.030 --> 00:46:39.929
<v Lazar> Yes.

00:46:43.467 --> 00:46:46.210
<v Anne-Mieke> I have one
more question for you, Lazar.

00:46:49.800 --> 00:46:54.730
If you were coming onto
Tesco.com and we told you

00:46:54.730 --> 00:46:59.690
you can buy groceries there,
didn't you expect that you could get

00:46:59.690 --> 00:47:07.750
in the top menu of this website,
it has all that groceries

00:47:07.750 --> 00:47:08.790
and F clothing?

00:47:08.790 --> 00:47:09.480
I can't see it.

00:47:09.480 --> 00:47:12.430
It's very small for me right now.

00:47:12.430 --> 00:47:14.680
You ended up in this slider.

00:47:14.680 --> 00:47:15.980
Didn't that surprise you?

00:47:17.097 --> 00:47:21.970
<v Lazar> Yes, especially
because I did not expect that.

00:47:23.350 --> 00:47:26.190
When you told me about
their accessibility policy,

00:47:26.190 --> 00:47:29.790
I was very pleasantly
surprised, very pleasantly.

00:47:30.940 --> 00:47:34.750
<v Anne-Mieke> The thing is,
on one hand, they did great

00:47:34.750 --> 00:47:40.010
and on the other hand feels like
they lead back very comfortably

00:47:40.010 --> 00:47:45.190
and thought, "Okay, we've made
this accessible one time, and bye,

00:47:45.190 --> 00:47:45.770
it's okay now."

00:47:46.764 --> 00:47:47.330
<v Lazar> It's another empty story.

00:47:47.330 --> 00:47:49.240
<v Anne-Mieke> I also
discovered some other things.

00:47:52.060 --> 00:47:53.060
Another question.

00:47:53.060 --> 00:47:57.000
Does it ever bother you if the
heading order in a site is weird?

00:47:58.309 --> 00:48:01.260
<v Lazar> Well,
to be honest, it does,

00:48:02.790 --> 00:48:10.390
but that is not the crucial
thing that I would use to say

00:48:10.390 --> 00:48:12.010
to assess the accessibility.

00:48:13.030 --> 00:48:18.570
Sure, the headings that are correct
or that are organized correctly,

00:48:18.570 --> 00:48:22.210
it's just like cherry on the
cake, but I personally believe

00:48:22.210 --> 00:48:29.370
that there are more urgent
accessibility issues that websites

00:48:29.370 --> 00:48:32.360
and that stores needs
to take care about.

00:48:32.999 --> 00:48:34.340
<v Piccia> What's the
first thing for you?

00:48:34.340 --> 00:48:39.250
Is it that shortcut that Tesco
was missing, or am I [crosstalk]

00:48:39.250 --> 00:48:40.870
<v Lazar> For me, yes.

00:48:40.870 --> 00:48:44.665
Now please keep in mind that I
have been using a screen reader

00:48:44.666 --> 00:48:45.930
since 2004.

00:48:48.380 --> 00:48:55.380
It might be that those things are
not the first priority to someone

00:48:55.380 --> 00:48:56.380
who is brand new.

00:48:57.580 --> 00:49:01.400
I don't know how a person who just
started using this could feel.

00:49:05.720 --> 00:49:10.830
Maybe for me, headings are not
the most important priority,

00:49:10.830 --> 00:49:13.120
but for someone who just
started, yes.

00:49:14.820 --> 00:49:17.190
That's why it's important
to improve this.

00:49:17.190 --> 00:49:17.660
<v Anne-Mieke> [crosstalk]

00:49:17.660 --> 00:49:19.550
<v Devin Egger> Lazar,
I'm going to have to drop it there.

00:49:19.550 --> 00:49:20.640
Thanks, guys.

00:49:20.640 --> 00:49:24.300
Really, Piccia, Lazar,
Anne, that was just

00:49:24.300 --> 00:49:28.580
such a great eye-opening
experience and from everyone

00:49:28.580 --> 00:49:33.790
that was participating, just
what a really humbling experience

00:49:33.790 --> 00:49:37.870
watching the difficulties that we
had going through that website.

00:49:39.640 --> 00:49:41.530
I hope everyone enjoyed
that as much as I did.

00:49:41.530 --> 00:49:43.850
We're going to take a quick
break and we'll be coming back

00:49:43.850 --> 00:49:45.670
for the lightning rounds.

00:49:45.670 --> 00:49:46.740
My name is Devin Egger.

00:49:46.740 --> 00:49:49.710
I'm from, HDC, a senior developer.

00:49:50.840 --> 00:49:53.370
Just make sure to talk
about your experience

00:49:53.370 --> 00:50:01.050
on the social media's
#WPA11YDAY and #WPAD2022.

00:50:01.050 --> 00:50:03.110
We'll be back shortly
with the Lightning Talks.
