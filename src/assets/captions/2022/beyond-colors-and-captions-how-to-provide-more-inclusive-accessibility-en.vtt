[silence]

00:00:32.176 --> 00:00:35.289
<v Carrie Dils> Welcome to
WordPress accessibility day.

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:40.150
My name is Carrie Dils and I am a
WordPress developer and instructor.

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:43.110
You're tuned in to a
session with Bela Gaytan,

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.070
who will share beyond
colors and captions,

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.370
how to provide more
inclusive accessibility.

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.010
If anybody's got questions,
feel free to add those

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:53.190
during the presentation.

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.370
There's a Q&A tab in slide O,
and we'll address those questions

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:58.810
at the end of the session.

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:02.670
You can also use the ideas section
to chat with other attendees.

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.760
Please allow me to introduce Bela.

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:11.750
Bela Gaytan is a technical instructor
designer at Pantheon, Community

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.040
and Social Media Manager for the
eLearning Designers Community

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.620
and Academy, WordPress web
developer, and an advocate

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:20.520
for underrepresented groups.

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:26.550
She holds a Bachelor of Business
in human resource management,

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:29.760
and a Master of Education
and Learning and Technology.

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:35.400
Known for her authenticity,
transparency, and vulnerability,

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.140
she disrupts spaces
to create change.

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.270
She uses her lived experience
and intersectional identities

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.964
as someone who is a Latina,
neurodivergent, queer,

00:01:45.965 --> 00:01:48.960
visually impaired,
and physically disabled.

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.030
Leveraging the power of these
experiences, Bela builds communities,

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.420
nurtures social connections, and
educates folks on diversity, equity,

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.420
inclusion, and accessibility.

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.970
Welcome, Bela.

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:00.970
It's great to have you.

00:02:03.703 --> 00:02:05.690
<v Bela Gaytan> Hi,
Carrie, and everyone.

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:06.730
So wonderful to be here.

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:08.610
You nailed my name, so good job.

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:09.610
I love that.

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:12.990
As Carrie said, I'm Bela Gaytan.

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.970
My pronouns are she and her.

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.080
Today I'm going to be presenting on
what I call inclusive accessibility,

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.140
thinking beyond
colors and captions.

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:24.600
We will jump right into it.

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.967
Disclaimer, most of my stuff
is really interactive, s

00:02:29.968 --> 00:02:32.609
o I will be looking at
the chat quite often

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.190
to see if I'm able to
see anything pop up,

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.620
but please feel free
to ask questions.

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.200
I always love that.

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.490
I'm going to jump right in here.

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:43.170
Meet me, Bela.

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.520
Most of this on the screen,
Carrie already covered except

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:50.170
for the final second to last
one, that says I love coffee,

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.870
plants, laughing, and cats and you
may see my cat make an appearance.

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:56.910
There's a picture of me
here, but I will go ahead

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.270
and give a visual
description of myself now.

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:00.880
I am a light-skinned Latina.

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:06.320
I have short, dark, curly blue
hair, light blue-green eyes.

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:10.250
I'm wearing, I think,
it's turquoise.

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:13.870
I am colorblind,
so it is like a turquoise floral top

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:18.980
with a bunch of dots, strangely
reminiscent of a colorblind test.

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:20.860
I find that ironic.

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:22.710
I have tattooed sleeves.

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:27.400
Behind me, you'll see a soothing
green wall and lots of plant babies.

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.790
Let's jump right
into this my friends.

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:36.550
Let's start with who
benefits from accessibility.

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:39.660
The first group that
we'll talk about,

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:42.690
people with mobility impairments
benefit from accessibility.

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:48.990
LGBTQIA+ folks benefit
from accessibility.

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:54.750
Before I hear people saying, "Wait,
why being queer, being lesbian,

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:56.530
being gay, it's not a disability."

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:59.500
I know, but just bear with
me, I promise I will bring it

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.530
around full circle and explain
why that's included in here.

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:07.620
Other people that benefit
from accessibility are those

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.230
with visual impairments.

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:14.820
Persons who are deaf
or hard of hearing

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:18.670
or have speech impairments can
benefit from accessibility.

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:23.793
Individuals with intellectual
disabilities benefit

00:04:23.794 --> 00:04:25.190
from accessibility.

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:27.720
This is a photo of me
with my Uncle Norby,

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.260
one of my most favorite
people in the world

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.360
and he is intellectually disabled
and very happy to be part

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.360
of this session.

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:38.270
Finally, everyone benefits
from accessibility.

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:41.360
Everyone, everyone, everyone,
not just people that are disabled,

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.150
not just people that
ask for accommodations,

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:44.618
and we'll go over that.

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:48.879
When we're talking
about disabilities,

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:50.900
I really would like for everyone

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:55.630
to think or to realize, I guess,
that you can't be inclusive

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:57.800
if you're not accessible.

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:58.640
Let me say that again.

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:02.870
You cannot be inclusive
unless you are accessible.

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:05.740
Disabilities and inclusion
need to go hand in hand.

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:08.740
When we're talking about
disabilities, we're focusing

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:10.800
on four main categories here.

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.750
We're talking about
visual disabilities,

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:18.340
hearing and speech disabilities,
physical disabilities,

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:20.310
and cognitive disabilities.

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:24.230
Then at the center is that
sweet spot, where I really tried

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:26.858
to just focus on not
only disabilities,

00:05:26.859 --> 00:05:29.900
but also being inclusive
and accessibility.

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:32.010
I call that inclusive
accessibility.

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:34.968
Not a very unique
name, but I'll keep it.

00:05:34.968 --> 00:05:35.889
[chuckles]

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:38.780
We're going to start and
we're just going to go

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:40.750
through all the
different categories.

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:43.790
I'm going to talk about the
different types of disabilities

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:47.000
and then the design
considerations to keep in mind.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.650
I will give another disclaimer
as well, I am neurodivergent.

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:54.870
I do have some cognitive issues.

00:05:54.870 --> 00:06:00.120
Sometimes I may not say the right
word, or it comes out differently.

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:02.450
I will try to rephrase
myself if there's anything

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:04.120
that anyone does not understand.

00:06:06.066 --> 00:06:08.468
I do move around a lot,
so I'm sorry for that.

00:06:08.468 --> 00:06:09.360
[laughs]

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:10.520
All right.

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:12.260
We'll start with visual.

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:17.800
Types of visual disabilities,
partial or total vision loss,

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:20.850
low vision, colorblindness.

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:25.430
Now I want to remind you all
that, it's not just people

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:28.350
that have permanent disabilities
that need accessibility.

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:32.660
Other situations before I
continue, let's talk

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:37.400
about temporary disabilities,
situational disabilities.

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:40.610
When we're talking about
visual disabilities,

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:44.630
someone could have just had their
eyes dilated at an optometrist

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:47.570
or ophthalmologist's office,
and they're just not able

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:50.690
to have that depth perception
and vision that they're used to.

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:56.110
Someone may have painful eyes
from allergies, or infections,

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:59.160
or just sensitive eyes.

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:01.740
Then there's others that
have light sensitivity.

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:05.550
When you're thinking about
designing for people to be able

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:09.290
to accommodate those that have
visual needs, you want to ensure

00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:11.320
that the colors have
enough contrast.

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:16.120
There's no such thing
as an inaccessible color

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:19.900
but you do have inaccessible
color combinations.

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:25.300
If you look at my colors,
because I'm colorblind, I tend to go

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:28.550
for colors that have a lot
of contrast, just naturally,

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:35.630
without really running it through a
checker, but let's say the top bar

00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:40.770
where it's black, instead was maybe
like a, let's say a tan color.

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:43.650
The yellow probably would not
be accessible against that,

00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:45.840
because it just would not
provide enough contrast,

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:47.420
the white definitely wouldn't.

00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:52.910
Just ensuring that your colors
have enough contrast between them.

00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:58.850
Including alt text for images,
allowing users the ability to zoom in

00:07:58.850 --> 00:07:59.850
on content.

00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:04.440
Using text instead
of images for text.

00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:07.280
Some of you that are as old as I
am, I'm going to take you back here.

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:13.540
Do you remember back in the
original MySpace days and GeoCities,

00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:14.980
I think, before Yahoo bought them?

00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:18.850
If you remember back then,
there were a lot of websites

00:08:18.850 --> 00:08:22.920
that offered you the
ability to put in some text,

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:25.010
and then you could style it.

00:08:25.010 --> 00:08:28.520
It would have like flames
coming out or bubbles coming up.

00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:30.510
I know I'm not the only
one that use those, right?

00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:35.550
Something like that,
although it looks really cool.

00:08:35.550 --> 00:08:38.000
If you're adding an
image like that to OSI,

00:08:39.850 --> 00:08:43.330
someone that's using a screen reader
is not going to know what that says.

00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:48.920
You want to really be careful
about using an image of text,

00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:52.380
instead of adding the
actual text on there.

00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:54.130
But if you use that
sparingly, it's okay.

00:08:54.130 --> 00:08:56.010
Just make sure you add
the alt text in there.

00:08:56.010 --> 00:09:02.480
The other thing is not relying on
color alone to convey information.

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:06.200
Classic example of that would
be if you have a Red Stop

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:09.370
and a Green Go button, someone
that's colorblind like myself,

00:09:09.370 --> 00:09:13.850
if there's no other indication
as to what are the purposes

00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:17.320
of each button,
it defeats the purpose there.

00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:24.160
Having clear and concise page titles,
link text headings and labels.

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:26.680
Those will really help people
especially that use screen readers,

00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:30.630
so that they can navigate quickly
and efficiently to the area

00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:32.070
that they're wanting to get to.

00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:36.410
Finally,
visual descriptions in events.

00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:38.500
I have had some people
talk to me and tell me

00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:41.560
that they feel uncomfortable
describing themselves,

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:48.140
and most of the people that I
talk with they say that part

00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:52.760
of it is just not having
enough-- how do I want to say it?

00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:56.660
Not self-love, but just
competence to describe themselves.

00:09:56.660 --> 00:10:01.900
While that is valid, and I know a lot
of people struggle with self-image,

00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:05.150
it's really important to provide
those visual descriptions

00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:06.610
when you're in live events.

00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:10.370
You can be as detailed
or as vague as you want.

00:10:10.370 --> 00:10:12.420
I could just say, "Hi, I'm Bela.

00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:18.370
I am a woman with short
hair and a dressy top."

00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:22.250
Personally, I like to be more
detailed because I feel like

00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:26.340
when I talk about my ethnicity,
and the plants behind me,

00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:31.330
it just gives it that extra
added personality to it.

00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:34.530
I feel like I let people have
a more equitable experience

00:10:34.530 --> 00:10:38.370
because I'm trying to let
them imagine everything

00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:41.470
that they can see here,
that everyone else is able to see,

00:10:41.470 --> 00:10:43.890
if that makes sense.

00:10:43.890 --> 00:10:49.380
Moving away from visual,
let's go to hearing and speech.

00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:51.650
This is a photo of
myself and my dad.

00:10:54.210 --> 00:10:58.410
I am colorblind, my dad is
colorblind, and my dad is also deaf

00:10:58.410 --> 00:11:02.160
in one ear, so I felt it was pretty
cool to be able to put us here

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:03.970
on this slide.

00:11:03.970 --> 00:11:09.090
I also have a speech impediment that
I've had to have speech therapy for.

00:11:09.090 --> 00:11:12.900
It's like we were
meant for this slide.

00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:17.090
When we're talking about
hearing and speech disabilities,

00:11:17.090 --> 00:11:19.850
we're talking about someone
who's deaf or hard of hearing,

00:11:19.850 --> 00:11:22.700
such as my dad being
deaf in one ear.

00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:26.990
People that stutter, people that
have speech sound disorders,

00:11:26.990 --> 00:11:30.340
as I did as a child,
but then also we want to think

00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:36.200
about something like throat cancer,
or what if someone has strep throat?

00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:39.920
I've never had strep throat,
knock on wood, but I have heard

00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:44.140
that it is extremely painful,
and I hope I never get it.

00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:47.430
Someone with an ear infection,
those types of things that are going

00:11:47.430 --> 00:11:49.640
to affect your hearing
and possibly your speech.

00:11:51.190 --> 00:11:55.620
Design considerations for this
group of folks would be number one,

00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:57.490
to allow communication options.

00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:04.480
You would want to not only allow
people-- let me rephrase that.

00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:07.820
I'll give you a really good
example of who does this well,

00:12:07.820 --> 00:12:09.990
Duolingo, the language app.

00:12:09.990 --> 00:12:14.140
When you're in Duolingo,
if you're not able to speak as part

00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:16.202
of your lessons,
you can push a button

00:12:16.202 --> 00:12:18.200
that says I'm not able to speak.

00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:21.110
They also have one for listening,
where you can push a button

00:12:21.110 --> 00:12:23.020
that says I'm not able to listen.

00:12:24.250 --> 00:12:28.410
Although that is, I think,
geared towards able bodied folks

00:12:28.410 --> 00:12:32.880
and just being in a public place,
it's also a really great way

00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:36.460
to accommodate people that
may have issues with hearing,

00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:41.600
or may have speech, and issues
with talking in that moment.

00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:46.430
Allowing different communication
options, allowing people to type,

00:12:46.430 --> 00:12:51.390
not making people speak on a
microphone during Zoom meetings

00:12:51.390 --> 00:12:54.330
and stuff like that.

00:12:54.330 --> 00:12:58.960
The other thing is provide
captions on video and audio.

00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:03.080
This one is pretty good, and it's why
I've titled this talk Beyond Colors

00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:06.490
and Captions, because I think colors
and captions are the main things

00:13:06.490 --> 00:13:09.430
that folks tend to focus on when
they think about accessibility,

00:13:11.310 --> 00:13:13.550
but that is always helpful.

00:13:13.550 --> 00:13:17.700
My dad likes to have the
subtitles on because it allows him

00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:20.600
to better be able to hear
what's going on the TV,

00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:23.720
since he does have one ear
that's completely deaf.

00:13:25.910 --> 00:13:30.450
My son and I are both neurodivergent
and we like to have the subtitles on.

00:13:30.450 --> 00:13:34.210
It's just this sensory thing,
I guess, that we like to have both

00:13:34.210 --> 00:13:36.850
of those going on, where we
can see the words and be able

00:13:36.850 --> 00:13:42.050
to see what's going on
the television as well.

00:13:42.050 --> 00:13:45.340
Another very important thing
I want you to think about,

00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:48.320
don't assume that all deaf
folks know sign language.

00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:51.010
I will use my dad as an example.

00:13:51.010 --> 00:13:54.240
He's deaf in one year,
he has never learned sign language.

00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:57.980
The deafness was from him
getting the mumps as a child,

00:13:57.980 --> 00:14:00.850
so it's not going to
spread into the other ear.

00:14:00.850 --> 00:14:04.030
I have a very good friend,
you may all know her, Meryl Evans,

00:14:04.030 --> 00:14:08.340
she is a phenomenal human
being, a wonderful advocate.

00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:10.730
She's deaf and she lip reads.

00:14:10.730 --> 00:14:12.360
She does not know sign language.

00:14:13.850 --> 00:14:16.500
Not everyone who's deaf is
going to be able to lip read,

00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:19.470
not every person that's deaf
is going to be able to sign.

00:14:19.470 --> 00:14:22.540
You need to find
out what folks need,

00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:26.050
in order to best accommodate
them and don't make assumptions.

00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:32.040
Let's move on to physical.

00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:35.670
When we're talking about physical
disabilities, these are also

00:14:35.670 --> 00:14:39.570
known as like mobility
disabilities or impairments.

00:14:39.570 --> 00:14:44.770
We're talking about things such as
ALS amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,

00:14:44.770 --> 00:14:48.430
I think that's also known as
Lou Gehrig's disease, someone

00:14:48.430 --> 00:14:54.550
that is partially or fully paralyzed,
someone that has arthritis,

00:14:54.550 --> 00:14:57.528
people with connective
tissue disorders,

00:14:57.529 --> 00:14:59.780
someone who has a broken hand,

00:14:59.780 --> 00:15:01.860
or maybe someone that
had a recent surgery.

00:15:03.030 --> 00:15:04.790
I will use myself
as an example again.

00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:09.170
If you guys are noticing a
theme here, I rely very heavily

00:15:09.170 --> 00:15:12.320
on lived experience because
I think that's so important

00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:16.390
when we're talking about disabilities
and accessibility and listening

00:15:16.390 --> 00:15:19.080
to the voices of people
who have gone through it.

00:15:21.490 --> 00:15:25.970
I have a rare connective tissue
disorder, and essentially,

00:15:25.970 --> 00:15:28.980
my collagen throughout
my entire body is weak.

00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:32.430
It's a genetic defect, there's
nothing you can really do about it.

00:15:32.430 --> 00:15:36.640
It's progressive, it's
degenerative, but one of the things

00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:41.570
that really bothers me as a lot, is
I am hypermobile in all of my joints.

00:15:41.570 --> 00:15:44.430
I overextend with every movement.

00:15:46.090 --> 00:15:50.310
Sometimes when I'm typing,
after a couple hours or so,

00:15:50.310 --> 00:15:54.230
my fingers have just had it
and I have to take a break.

00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:59.610
It's the same thing with walking or
doing any kind of repetitive motions.

00:15:59.610 --> 00:16:02.680
I have to really work
on conserving my energy.

00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:07.290
I'll give another example,
in terms of a situational

00:16:07.290 --> 00:16:08.940
or temporary disability.

00:16:08.940 --> 00:16:12.930
My mom recently had to have
surgery on her shoulder,

00:16:12.930 --> 00:16:17.420
and my family, we're dorks and we
play Uno a couple times a week,

00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:19.820
we it throw down.

00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:23.730
My dad, because my mom was having
trouble holding all of her cards,

00:16:23.730 --> 00:16:29.150
he went into a shop and got like
some wood, and made like a stand,

00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:31.660
so that my mom could
have it in front of her,

00:16:31.660 --> 00:16:35.060
she could set her Uno cards on there,
and nobody could see around it,

00:16:35.060 --> 00:16:39.270
until she was able to play
again without any assistance.

00:16:39.270 --> 00:16:43.190
My dad hopped in and accommodated my
mom's needs, which was really cool.

00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:49.150
When considering design--
oops, let me go back.

00:16:49.150 --> 00:16:50.160
There we go.

00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:50.930
[laughs]

00:16:50.930 --> 00:16:52.150
I got a little click happy there.

00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:58.770
When we're talking about design
considerations, don't rely on input

00:16:58.770 --> 00:17:00.400
from just a mouse.

00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:04.950
Think about people that may
have to use voice to speech

00:17:04.950 --> 00:17:07.830
to be able to interact and
they can't type or use a mouse.

00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:12.950
When I was in Morocco,
I met a wonderful painter

00:17:12.950 --> 00:17:18.670
who did not have the use
of his arms or his hands,

00:17:18.670 --> 00:17:21.800
and he painted by putting
a paintbrush in his mouth.

00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:23.560
He used his phone
the same way as well.

00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:26.813
He had a stylus that
he was able to use

00:17:26.813 --> 00:17:28.881
on his phone just using his mouth.

00:17:30.850 --> 00:17:34.020
Avoid causing the user
to excessively scroll

00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:36.660
and perform navigational clicks.

00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:40.620
This one, I don't believe I see
it anywhere when I'm looking

00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:42.918
at different
accessibility guidelines,

00:17:42.919 --> 00:17:44.980
and I feel like it should be there

00:17:46.810 --> 00:17:51.420
because a lot of people that
have a lot of chronic pain,

00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:56.060
or if you imagine someone
that is partially paralyzed,

00:17:56.060 --> 00:18:00.460
they have very little movement
in their hands, can you imagine

00:18:00.460 --> 00:18:04.860
how painful it is for this person
to just have to scroll, scroll,

00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:06.370
scroll, scroll?

00:18:06.370 --> 00:18:07.610
I'll give you a perfect example.

00:18:07.610 --> 00:18:11.770
If you go to LinkedIn or any--
I think it's mostly on LinkedIn,

00:18:11.770 --> 00:18:15.470
people will post one line of
text, enter, enter, enter, enter,

00:18:15.470 --> 00:18:18.520
another line of text,
enter, enter, enter.

00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:19.800
Well, it looks really cool.

00:18:20.870 --> 00:18:25.120
Can you imagine how many times you
have to scroll, scroll, scroll?

00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:27.910
I tell people,
I understand it looks really cool,

00:18:27.910 --> 00:18:35.410
it makes a much more visually
appetizing post, but consider people

00:18:35.410 --> 00:18:41.280
that really have to ration
their energy during the day.

00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:44.080
Sometimes I get to a point where
I've gone through so many of those,

00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:47.200
I don't read the posts and I
have to just get off the computer

00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:49.200
because my hands are
hurting too much.

00:18:50.470 --> 00:18:52.060
Please be mindful of that.

00:18:52.060 --> 00:18:54.840
I understand wanting to be
visually appealing, but just try

00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:59.780
to be mindful of any type of
excessive movement or action

00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:01.490
that someone has to take.

00:19:03.309 --> 00:19:05.811
Also, ensure that the
content is compatible

00:19:05.811 --> 00:19:09.270
with multiple device layouts.

00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:12.540
Someone may be using a desktop,
someone may be using laptop,

00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:16.820
someone may be using a mobile
phone, a tablet, or any other type

00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:18.200
of assistive device.

00:19:20.350 --> 00:19:22.380
One of the things you want to
keep in mind is to make sure

00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:25.760
that you have it set
up to be responsive.

00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:28.200
What responsive means when you're
talking about web development,

00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:34.270
is that no matter the screen size,
your content will adjust accordingly.

00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:38.670
If you want to see responsiveness
in action, go to a website,

00:19:38.670 --> 00:19:41.910
have it on full screen on your
computer, and then gradually

00:19:41.910 --> 00:19:46.140
just start dragging the
corner down and minimizing it.

00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:49.420
As you do, you'll start to
see things shift around.

00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:51.990
Typically, as you get
smaller, you take away a lot

00:19:51.990 --> 00:19:55.300
of the excessive stuff in
the menu and stuff like that,

00:19:56.530 --> 00:19:58.460
but when you're designing
things, try to be responsive

00:19:58.460 --> 00:20:01.000
and make sure that the
content will be compatible.

00:20:02.510 --> 00:20:04.870
Also, just offer
multiple input methods.

00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:07.850
This is very similar to what we
were talking about with people

00:20:07.850 --> 00:20:11.420
that are hard of hearing
or have speech impairments.

00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:13.940
It just makes it a lot
more easier for folks

00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:16.990
that have physical disabilities.

00:20:18.190 --> 00:20:19.530
Now cognitive.

00:20:19.530 --> 00:20:25.250
Again, here is a picture of my
perfect Uncle Norby in his Selena hat

00:20:25.250 --> 00:20:27.160
with roses on it.

00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:30.640
I don't know what his shirt
says, but he's got all his bling

00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:35.960
on his neck,
and he is looking super cool.

00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:38.620
When we're talking about cognitive
disabilities, we're talking

00:20:38.620 --> 00:20:42.430
about people that have intellectual
disabilities, like my uncle.

00:20:42.430 --> 00:20:45.630
We're talking about people
that have neurodivergence,

00:20:45.630 --> 00:20:50.550
which can be things like ADHD,
autism, personality disorders,

00:20:50.550 --> 00:20:53.500
and other mental health illnesses.

00:20:54.890 --> 00:20:59.240
Things like dyslexia and dyscalculia,
are cognitive disabilities.

00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:03.400
Someone who has memory loss,
migraines, severe headaches,

00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:04.850
or someone that's had a concussion.

00:21:07.010 --> 00:21:11.370
I have multiple things that
affect my cognitive ability.

00:21:11.370 --> 00:21:14.990
I do have ADHD,
I am likely autistic,

00:21:14.990 --> 00:21:18.570
and I have borderline
personality disorder.

00:21:18.570 --> 00:21:22.140
I also have an undiagnosed
brain disorder.

00:21:22.140 --> 00:21:26.150
I have multiple lesions in
my brain and they do affect

00:21:26.150 --> 00:21:29.470
my cognitive abilities
and my memory.

00:21:29.470 --> 00:21:30.900
I'm special.

00:21:30.900 --> 00:21:37.820
I've got all this as my friends
say, glitter going on in my head.

00:21:37.820 --> 00:21:40.940
It makes it difficult sometimes
because I do have memory loss

00:21:40.940 --> 00:21:44.760
or as I said before, I struggle
with trying to find words sometimes

00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:46.520
and they just won't come to me.

00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:52.060
Whenever you're dealing with someone
that has a cognitive disability,

00:21:52.060 --> 00:21:56.350
you want to be really mindful
about not overloading them

00:21:56.350 --> 00:22:02.210
and just making the content as
accessible, and easily digestible

00:22:02.210 --> 00:22:03.210
as possible.

00:22:05.030 --> 00:22:08.970
One of the things I'm a huge
advocate of, is image descriptions.

00:22:08.970 --> 00:22:11.750
Now that is different
from alt text.

00:22:11.750 --> 00:22:15.150
Alt text is for people
that have screen readers,

00:22:15.150 --> 00:22:18.174
so that they can understand
if an image is decorative

00:22:18.175 --> 00:22:19.350
or what is an image.

00:22:20.580 --> 00:22:25.370
Image descriptions are
placed within the content.

00:22:25.370 --> 00:22:27.817
The way that I do it,
is I put an image description

00:22:27.818 --> 00:22:28.900
at the end of my post.

00:22:30.050 --> 00:22:36.550
While my alt text for this one might
say, "This is Bela's Uncle Norby,

00:22:36.550 --> 00:22:42.260
he is smiling," that might be
all that I put for the alt text.

00:22:42.260 --> 00:22:45.610
For the image description,
I would go into more detail

00:22:45.610 --> 00:22:50.980
and I would say, "This is DJ
Norby," as he likes to be called

00:22:50.980 --> 00:22:52.500
because he loves rap.

00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:59.650
"He's wearing a bucket hat with roses
and a picture of Selena on them.

00:22:59.650 --> 00:23:03.760
He's wearing a blue sleeveless top,
and he is got several necklaces

00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:04.540
around his neck.

00:23:04.540 --> 00:23:08.320
He's smiling and looking off
to the side, and he's happy."

00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:12.300
Why all of the extra fluff, Bela?

00:23:12.300 --> 00:23:15.500
Okay, let me explain.

00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:17.210
Again, I'll use my
own lived experience.

00:23:17.210 --> 00:23:21.390
For someone like myself,
I might not know what colors are

00:23:21.390 --> 00:23:24.980
in the photo,
and sometimes I want to know that.

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:29.620
Other things, people that have
neurodivergence, especially,

00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:33.810
may not be able to tell what
kind of mood a photo is supposed

00:23:33.810 --> 00:23:37.190
to represent.

00:23:37.190 --> 00:23:40.680
Perfect example, my uncle here
is not smiling with his teeth.

00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:42.740
I don't smile with my teeth either.

00:23:42.740 --> 00:23:46.850
To some people, you might look
at him and think, is he upset?

00:23:48.110 --> 00:23:49.620
Is he confused?

00:23:49.620 --> 00:23:51.630
Is he contemplating something?

00:23:51.630 --> 00:23:54.720
Is he in pain?

00:23:56.080 --> 00:23:58.700
Adding in any type of emotion
or feeling that's supposed

00:23:58.700 --> 00:24:03.340
to be represented in the photo,
really will be helpful to people

00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:07.950
that may not understand why a photo
is attached to a certain piece

00:24:07.950 --> 00:24:08.950
of content.

00:24:11.090 --> 00:24:14.250
That's the difference between
alt text and image descriptions.

00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:22.630
You want to make sure that you
use clear and concise language.

00:24:22.630 --> 00:24:29.720
If you're too technical or too,
can we say over-professional or fancy

00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:34.380
with your words, it might look
really cool to you on paper,

00:24:34.380 --> 00:24:37.190
and you might think like,
"Man, that looks awesome."

00:24:38.420 --> 00:24:41.620
Chances are though,
the fancier and the fluffier you try

00:24:41.620 --> 00:24:45.940
to make your content,
you're going to lose folks.

00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:49.600
Just try to be really clear,
concise, get to the point,

00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:52.880
and try not to be ambiguous.

00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:57.160
Avoiding cognitive overload.

00:24:57.160 --> 00:24:59.280
Perfect example of
cognitive overload.

00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:03.970
I was in a Zoom session
recently, and the person came on,

00:25:05.270 --> 00:25:09.690
and they had it set up, so that
there was a border surrounding

00:25:09.690 --> 00:25:12.190
the frame of being
able to view them.

00:25:13.870 --> 00:25:18.660
It had a looping video
of stars in space,

00:25:18.660 --> 00:25:21.590
and not just stars sitting
there, but motion.

00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:26.591
Then there were also
some little animations

00:25:26.592 --> 00:25:28.030
that would come in and out.

00:25:29.029 --> 00:25:36.800
Then behind him, he had a very
active aquarium with lots of bubbles

00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:38.360
and stuff coming up.

00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:43.140
I had to leave after about 10 minutes
because I just could not focus.

00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:45.390
There were so many things
that I was looking at,

00:25:45.390 --> 00:25:46.590
I couldn't really focus on him.

00:25:46.590 --> 00:25:49.650
Every time I'd start
seeing the video re-loop

00:25:49.650 --> 00:25:52.730
and I'm seeing the bubbles in
the background, and everything.

00:25:52.730 --> 00:25:56.380
It was way too distracting.

00:25:56.380 --> 00:25:58.560
You want to be mindful of
stuff like that for people

00:25:58.560 --> 00:26:00.310
that have cognitive disabilities.

00:26:01.940 --> 00:26:04.810
Provide context
when it's not clear.

00:26:04.810 --> 00:26:07.790
I can go back again to my
image description example,

00:26:07.790 --> 00:26:11.190
just letting someone know like,
"Hey, this is a picture of Norby,

00:26:11.190 --> 00:26:14.750
and he's happy and smiling
at--" I don't know,

00:26:14.750 --> 00:26:16.750
maybe there's a birthday cake
and a beer in the background

00:26:16.750 --> 00:26:20.280
that would make him smile,
but just give context

00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:22.040
when it might not
be clear to people.

00:26:23.230 --> 00:26:27.450
Along with that, be very careful
with sarcasm because a lot

00:26:27.450 --> 00:26:29.180
of people that have
cognitive disabilities,

00:26:29.180 --> 00:26:32.340
sarcasm doesn't go over
very well with them.

00:26:32.340 --> 00:26:33.380
I'm one of those people.

00:26:35.150 --> 00:26:38.180
For some people they
may not stop and think,

00:26:38.180 --> 00:26:40.550
"Wait, are they being serious?"

00:26:40.550 --> 00:26:44.550
and reach out and ask the person
that, they may actually feel hurt

00:26:44.550 --> 00:26:51.540
or attacked or they're just
not in a safe space for them.

00:26:51.540 --> 00:26:54.830
Try to provide context when
something might not be clear.

00:26:54.830 --> 00:26:57.820
Then the final one,
be engaging without being busy.

00:26:57.820 --> 00:27:02.520
Again, think back to the
webinar example that I gave.

00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:07.040
You can be engaging,
but you don't have to be so busy.

00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:09.110
I don't have to sit here and
have a pin roll in my hand

00:27:09.110 --> 00:27:12.010
with it blowing around,
and music in the background,

00:27:12.010 --> 00:27:15.890
and flashing lights everywhere to
get you to pay attention to me.

00:27:15.890 --> 00:27:20.080
Hopefully, I am animated and
interesting enough, but if I'm not,

00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:23.290
I accept criticism and
I will work on that.

00:27:24.750 --> 00:27:25.900
All right, my friends.

00:27:25.900 --> 00:27:29.811
Now, we're to inclusive
accessibility,

00:27:29.811 --> 00:27:31.383
what you've all been waiting for.

00:27:33.220 --> 00:27:38.940
I take accessibility further than
just people who need accommodations.

00:27:38.940 --> 00:27:41.900
One of the biggest things
that I'm an advocate for is

00:27:41.900 --> 00:27:47.540
that people deserve to be in
a psychologically safe space.

00:27:47.540 --> 00:27:51.680
They deserve access to a
psychologically safe space.

00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:57.470
I don't think I've ever heard
people really focus on that before,

00:27:57.470 --> 00:28:04.600
but it's so important because
people are very sensitive.

00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:07.840
People have emotions,
people have traumas from their past,

00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:10.240
and we can't always know that.

00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:15.250
Trying to be understanding and
receptive and proactive to be able

00:28:15.250 --> 00:28:19.920
to provide a safe space for
people, is so important.

00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:20.920
So, so important.

00:28:23.220 --> 00:28:26.580
Let's talk about the groups that
are often left out of accessibility.

00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:32.310
Again, these are not necessarily
disabilities, but just people

00:28:32.310 --> 00:28:36.590
that you don't often see that
need a psychologically safe space

00:28:36.590 --> 00:28:40.470
or need to be represented
more in order to be inclusive

00:28:40.470 --> 00:28:43.130
and diverse in our
accessibility efforts.

00:28:43.130 --> 00:28:47.530
We're talking about
LGBTQIA+ individuals.

00:28:47.530 --> 00:28:51.330
We're talking about immigrants
and non-native speakers

00:28:51.330 --> 00:28:56.070
of whatever language
your content is in.

00:28:56.070 --> 00:29:03.630
Those with mental health disorders,
oftentimes these folks are left out

00:29:03.630 --> 00:29:04.630
in accessibility.

00:29:05.620 --> 00:29:09.550
I have lived experience with that
and I can definitely attest to that,

00:29:09.550 --> 00:29:13.640
that I don't think enough people
focus on mental health disorders

00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:15.160
when they're creating content.

00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:18.310
I know we talked about
neurodivergent folks,

00:29:18.310 --> 00:29:23.590
but I still feel we're left out
quite a bit in accessibility.

00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:28.770
People of color ignore my parenthesis
there that I forgot to delete.

00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:33.580
Folks that wear religious clothing.

00:29:33.580 --> 00:29:40.100
Examples of that could be Muslims,
Sikhs, Jews, where you're able

00:29:40.100 --> 00:29:45.320
to look at someone and visually
identify what their faith

00:29:45.320 --> 00:29:46.520
or religion is.

00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:53.020
The elderly and plus size folks,
and this beautiful picture

00:29:53.020 --> 00:29:56.690
in the center with two
beautiful plus-size people.

00:29:56.690 --> 00:30:01.100
How many times do you go to a
website and see photos of people

00:30:01.100 --> 00:30:05.310
that are plus-sized or
people that are elderly?

00:30:06.510 --> 00:30:09.870
Most of the times you go to
these websites, anywhere online

00:30:09.870 --> 00:30:13.300
and you typically see people
that are in their 20s or 30s,

00:30:13.300 --> 00:30:18.660
people that are fit and people
that are considered attractive.

00:30:18.660 --> 00:30:28.220
When we're talking about more
inclusive design considerations,

00:30:28.220 --> 00:30:31.510
think about utilizing
inclusive photos.

00:30:31.510 --> 00:30:33.750
Now, go beyond skin color.

00:30:35.930 --> 00:30:38.480
What really gets me
though, is that if you go

00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:41.550
to the different stock photo
websites and stuff like that,

00:30:43.150 --> 00:30:47.830
if you search for diverse or
inclusive photos, the only thing

00:30:47.830 --> 00:30:49.514
that's going to be
diverse and inclusive

00:30:49.514 --> 00:30:52.290
in most of them is skin color.

00:30:52.290 --> 00:30:57.230
You'll see a group of people,
probably have a very similar age,

00:30:57.230 --> 00:31:01.760
hanging out in a bar or in an
office setting or on a sports team.

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:09.260
You don't tend to see a picture
that shows a Black child,

00:31:09.260 --> 00:31:16.110
a Latina that's in a wheelchair,
you don't see an elderly Asian man

00:31:16.110 --> 00:31:20.950
and a plus-sized trans
person all in one photo,

00:31:21.990 --> 00:31:25.320
but that's truly
diverse and inclusive.

00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:28.580
Unfortunately, we can't
always find photos like that.

00:31:28.580 --> 00:31:33.350
Do your best, try to think of
keywords that you can put in there

00:31:33.350 --> 00:31:37.290
and just try to imagine
that you want everybody

00:31:37.290 --> 00:31:41.000
to feel like they are
represented in the content.

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:45.000
We want people to look and feel
like, "Hey, that's kind of like me."

00:31:49.430 --> 00:31:52.620
Let's be honest, most of the
pages and websites and content

00:31:52.620 --> 00:31:57.140
that we go to are what are
considered to be attractive,

00:31:57.140 --> 00:32:02.870
20 to maybe 35-year-old white
folks, that's what we tend to see.

00:32:02.870 --> 00:32:07.570
We need more diversity, we need
more inclusion, we need to be able

00:32:07.570 --> 00:32:08.820
to represent everyone.

00:32:08.820 --> 00:32:11.560
Make everyone feel
welcome and represented.

00:32:12.570 --> 00:32:16.050
Another thing is to avoid
using triggering language.

00:32:18.030 --> 00:32:24.470
Without referring to any triggering
language, just know that a lot

00:32:24.470 --> 00:32:26.300
of people have had traumatic pasts.

00:32:26.300 --> 00:32:32.200
A lot of people have had very
painful experiences and traumas.

00:32:33.710 --> 00:32:39.150
Sometimes people will joke
about those situations.

00:32:39.150 --> 00:32:42.880
It's not funny, and it's not
psychologically safe for someone

00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:46.030
that has gone through that trauma.

00:32:46.030 --> 00:32:51.600
Another example in that area,
is sometimes we have some slang words

00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:56.550
that we use, that they have another
meaning and it's a very violent

00:32:56.550 --> 00:32:58.090
or traumatic meaning.

00:32:58.090 --> 00:33:03.960
Again, I don't want to say those,
but let me use an example of a slang.

00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:05.950
If you say like, "Oh,
it's a piece of cake."

00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:11.790
If someone is not
familiar with that phrase,

00:33:11.790 --> 00:33:15.620
they might think you're talking
about a literal piece of cake.

00:33:15.620 --> 00:33:18.930
For anyone here who's not
familiar with that term,

00:33:18.930 --> 00:33:22.430
it just means
something's very easy.

00:33:22.430 --> 00:33:24.180
I have no idea why
they came up with that

00:33:24.180 --> 00:33:26.460
because I don't think
baking a cake is easy.

00:33:28.860 --> 00:33:32.680
That's just a good way to try to
analyze your words and just try

00:33:32.680 --> 00:33:35.880
to look at them and think,
could that be taken another way?

00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:39.140
If yes, is it going to
be clear to the person?

00:33:39.140 --> 00:33:41.190
Also, could it be harmful?

00:33:41.190 --> 00:33:43.470
Could it be triggering for them?

00:33:48.410 --> 00:33:51.710
Use gender-neutral language.

00:33:52.890 --> 00:33:55.390
I will raise my hand and
be the first to admit

00:33:55.390 --> 00:33:58.030
that I'm still working on that.

00:33:58.030 --> 00:34:00.660
Especially with saying, "You guys."

00:34:00.660 --> 00:34:04.430
I'm originally from the North, I
grew up saying you guys all the time,

00:34:04.430 --> 00:34:08.940
never meant it to mean anyone
that is only a male or a man,

00:34:08.940 --> 00:34:11.960
but I'm trying to
get better with that.

00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:13.840
Just use gender-neutral language.

00:34:13.840 --> 00:34:18.040
There's no need to say he or
she, say they or them,

00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:20.517
if you don't know
the gender of someone

00:34:20.518 --> 00:34:22.560
or when you're creating content.

00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:27.250
Unless you're creating a specific
persona, then just say they or them.

00:34:28.610 --> 00:34:31.290
As an example,
if I were to describe this photo

00:34:31.290 --> 00:34:36.180
because I don't know the gender
identity of these two people,

00:34:36.180 --> 00:34:41.260
I would just say there are two people
standing in an office together.

00:34:41.260 --> 00:34:44.530
They are looking at each
other and they are smiling.

00:34:46.450 --> 00:34:48.000
They and them, it always works.

00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:51.950
Other things like when
you're talking about gender-

00:34:51.950 --> 00:34:58.710
I struggle saying that,
gender-neutral language, is mail man,

00:34:58.710 --> 00:34:59.810
police man.

00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:03.760
I'm trying to think
of some other ones.

00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:07.180
Instead of just say mail
person or mail delivery person

00:35:07.180 --> 00:35:11.720
or police person,
just something like that.

00:35:11.720 --> 00:35:16.960
I say um a lot too, I'm noticing
that and I clicked again.

00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:17.890
Let me go back.

00:35:17.890 --> 00:35:20.350
I get click happy,
I have to move my fingers around.

00:35:20.350 --> 00:35:22.240
I think that's the
neurodivergence in me.

00:35:23.670 --> 00:35:25.440
Avoid slang and jargon.

00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:27.840
I talked about that before
with the piece of cake.

00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:32.830
You have to remember that not
everybody uses these phrases

00:35:32.831 --> 00:35:40.390
like that or they might be non-native
to the area or not a native speaker

00:35:40.390 --> 00:35:41.390
of the language.

00:35:42.850 --> 00:35:45.930
Try to avoid that stuff,
but if you do want to use it,

00:35:45.930 --> 00:35:47.710
provide an explanation.

00:35:47.710 --> 00:35:49.530
I'll give a wonderful example.

00:35:49.530 --> 00:35:52.700
In one of my previous talks,
I believe, I said something

00:35:52.700 --> 00:35:54.140
about a potluck dinner.

00:35:55.360 --> 00:36:00.620
If you had no idea what a potluck
dinner was, you might think it's

00:36:00.620 --> 00:36:05.280
with a big pot outside or
something on a campfire,

00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:09.290
and maybe people just bring
whatever they want and throw it in

00:36:09.290 --> 00:36:14.150
and you hope you get lucky with
a delicious meal, but a lot

00:36:14.150 --> 00:36:15.950
of people won't know what that is.

00:36:15.950 --> 00:36:21.070
I explained to folks that a potluck
dinner is basically a dinner

00:36:21.070 --> 00:36:24.660
where people each bring a
dish and everyone shares.

00:36:25.670 --> 00:36:28.210
If you want to use stuff like
that, just explain it.

00:36:30.190 --> 00:36:34.820
Provide context for images and
stories, and then explain acronyms,

00:36:34.820 --> 00:36:38.580
abbreviations, and terms that
may not be well-known by all.

00:36:39.750 --> 00:36:42.960
Looking at my time,
I think I've got four minutes left

00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:43.960
and then time for questions.

00:36:43.960 --> 00:36:44.780
All right.

00:36:46.610 --> 00:36:48.510
The importance of
lived experiences.

00:36:48.510 --> 00:36:50.530
You might be wondering
why I brought myself

00:36:50.530 --> 00:36:52.720
into the equation so
much during this talk.

00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:55.040
It's not that I have an
ego, it's not that I want

00:36:55.040 --> 00:36:58.180
to be the center of attention,
but I have experience

00:36:58.180 --> 00:36:59.830
with all of this stuff.

00:36:59.830 --> 00:37:05.400
I'm always talking to others that
are disabled and have experience

00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:11.530
in inaccessibility and
disability because we're experts.

00:37:11.530 --> 00:37:16.550
We are experts on our own conditions,
on our bodies, on our means.

00:37:16.550 --> 00:37:21.230
This is why I think it's so
important to involve people

00:37:21.230 --> 00:37:24.560
that have lived experiences,
and that require accessibility.

00:37:26.500 --> 00:37:32.280
Using my own experiences, I have
multiple rare genetic disorders.

00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:37.910
They're progressive, degenerative,
there's no cure, and the information

00:37:37.910 --> 00:37:43.290
that I get from my medical providers,
compared to the information

00:37:43.290 --> 00:37:47.130
that I get from others who
have the same diseases as I do,

00:37:47.130 --> 00:37:48.770
is very different.

00:37:48.770 --> 00:37:54.080
Medical professional is going
by training alone, they're going

00:37:54.080 --> 00:37:59.370
by book knowledge or hands-on
experience with someone telling

00:37:59.370 --> 00:38:00.980
them how they feel.

00:38:00.980 --> 00:38:04.690
For those of us that have
lived experience, we're pros.

00:38:04.690 --> 00:38:07.320
We know what it feels like
inside our body, we know

00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:11.350
what it feels like to
deal with inaccessibility.

00:38:11.350 --> 00:38:17.070
Our voices matter and we need more
disabled folks out there kicking ass,

00:38:17.070 --> 00:38:21.960
and being vocal about
our lived experiences.

00:38:21.960 --> 00:38:25.530
This photo is in
Nashville a few years ago.

00:38:27.180 --> 00:38:30.000
One of the diseases that I
have is Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome,

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:34.220
and this was a global conference
that I attended and it felt

00:38:34.220 --> 00:38:38.540
so wonderful to be around so many
people who understood so much

00:38:38.540 --> 00:38:41.840
about the struggles
of this disease.

00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:44.790
My friends, that is it.

00:38:45.860 --> 00:38:47.830
I appreciate you spending
time with me today,

00:38:47.830 --> 00:38:50.480
whether you're live or
watching the recording.

00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:54.360
I have homework,
if any of you think that sounds fun.

00:38:55.640 --> 00:38:57.640
First of all,
contact me wherever you'd like.

00:38:57.640 --> 00:39:00.420
You can start at my website,
scroll down to the bottom,

00:39:00.420 --> 00:39:04.630
you can see all my social media
outlets or you can just contact me,

00:39:04.630 --> 00:39:06.520
connect on LinkedIn, whatever.

00:39:06.520 --> 00:39:13.880
Let me know how you plan to
incorporate inclusive accessibility

00:39:13.880 --> 00:39:15.590
going forward.

00:39:15.590 --> 00:39:20.370
Something I always tell everybody,
I say much love, be a good human

00:39:20.370 --> 00:39:23.700
and don't be a stranger because I
would absolutely love to connect.

00:39:23.700 --> 00:39:27.265
Again, I see that I have many
spaces here, I will fix this.

00:39:27.265 --> 00:39:28.640
[chuckles]

00:39:28.640 --> 00:39:32.780
If you want to find me online,
my website is simply my name,

00:39:32.780 --> 00:39:33.930
belagaytan.com.

00:39:35.130 --> 00:39:38.740
My handles on Twitter,
LinkedIn, Instagram,

00:39:38.740 --> 00:39:42.630
YouTube and Medium are also
just my name @BelaGaytan.

00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:46.370
That is it my friends.

00:39:47.900 --> 00:39:49.320
Let's see.

00:39:50.789 --> 00:39:54.000
<v Carrie> Oh wow, you just
knocked that right out of the park.

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:54.300
Thank you.

00:39:54.300 --> 00:39:55.690
<v Bela> Thank you, Carrie.

00:39:55.690 --> 00:39:56.711
[laughter]

00:39:56.711 --> 00:40:00.250
<v Carrie> I've wrote it
down because I love this.

00:40:00.250 --> 00:40:04.920
People deserve access to a
psychologically safe space.

00:40:06.730 --> 00:40:07.910
That's so wonderful.

00:40:09.780 --> 00:40:13.680
Thanks for just giving me
some different ways to think

00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:18.150
about accessibility and who that
applies to and what all that covers.

00:40:18.150 --> 00:40:19.270
That's fantastic.

00:40:19.270 --> 00:40:22.120
We have a couple of questions.

00:40:23.200 --> 00:40:24.770
Let's see.

00:40:24.770 --> 00:40:32.070
Do you have resources to suggest
for finding diverse photography?

00:40:32.070 --> 00:40:34.880
Are there photography collections
that are better than others

00:40:34.880 --> 00:40:35.990
for accessible diversity?

00:40:37.900 --> 00:40:40.200
<v Bela> Unfortunately,
there's not a lot.

00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:46.750
I know that there are some,
I don't remember them offhand.

00:40:48.070 --> 00:40:51.440
If you connect with me on LinkedIn,
I can send you the resources.

00:40:53.160 --> 00:40:59.480
Personally, I just tend to
go to Unsplash or Pexels.

00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:01.800
There's another one,
I think it's called Pixabay?

00:41:01.800 --> 00:41:03.730
Is it Pixabay or Pixabay?

00:41:03.730 --> 00:41:05.240
<v Carrie> Yes, I think so.

00:41:05.240 --> 00:41:07.470
<v Bela> I know it's one of those.

00:41:08.533 --> 00:41:11.540
I just tend to type in
some type of adjective,

00:41:11.540 --> 00:41:19.140
like Black person in
wheelchair Latina, blind Latina

00:41:19.140 --> 00:41:26.390
or plus-size folks, or Asian
elderly person and stuff like that.

00:41:26.390 --> 00:41:31.510
It can be very tiring because
like I said, if you-- try this,

00:41:31.510 --> 00:41:32.640
I want all of you to try this.

00:41:32.640 --> 00:41:36.940
Go to a website and type in diverse
photos or diverse group of people

00:41:36.940 --> 00:41:39.330
or something,
and you'll see what I said.

00:41:39.330 --> 00:41:43.580
You'll see it'll be typically like
20 to 30-year-olds, attractive.

00:41:43.580 --> 00:41:46.120
I'm doing air quotes for
anybody that can't see

00:41:46.120 --> 00:41:50.570
and varying skin colors,
but not like different body sizes,

00:41:50.570 --> 00:41:55.870
not different abilities, not like
people that are older or people

00:41:55.870 --> 00:41:59.820
that are visibly part of like any
type of underrepresented group.

00:42:01.010 --> 00:42:03.960
If you connect with me on LinkedIn,
I do have a resource saved.

00:42:03.960 --> 00:42:07.960
I can forward that to you with
some websites that do cater

00:42:07.960 --> 00:42:10.940
to more like diverse photos.

00:42:12.397 --> 00:42:13.160
<v Carrie> Fantastic.

00:42:13.160 --> 00:42:13.540
Okay.

00:42:13.540 --> 00:42:15.320
That's the homework assignment.

00:42:15.320 --> 00:42:20.405
Everybody email their not so
diverse diverse photos to Bela.

00:42:20.405 --> 00:42:24.150
[laugh]

00:42:24.150 --> 00:42:27.610
Another question,
do you have ideas for

00:42:27.610 --> 00:42:31.890
how people can discuss triggering
language respectfully and safely?

00:42:33.284 --> 00:42:33.740
<v Bela> Okay.

00:42:33.740 --> 00:42:38.860
I guess, are they able to
elaborate on that or, because I--

00:42:40.158 --> 00:42:40.750
<v Carrie> Let's see.

00:42:40.750 --> 00:42:46.860
Yes, we'll give them a second
to see if they come with more.

00:42:49.559 --> 00:42:51.801
[crosstalk]

00:42:51.802 --> 00:42:58.270
<v Bela> Because I'm thinking is
there a way to talk about something

00:42:58.270 --> 00:43:02.850
that might be triggering in a
better way, or is this about talking

00:43:02.850 --> 00:43:06.620
to someone about how not to be
triggering with their language?

00:43:06.620 --> 00:43:07.270
You know what I mean?

00:43:07.270 --> 00:43:12.770
I guess, I'll start to--
Okay, I see it.

00:43:12.770 --> 00:43:15.430
The question is about how to
talk about triggering language

00:43:15.430 --> 00:43:18.250
without using triggering
language, so people

00:43:18.250 --> 00:43:20.270
in the conversation
can be comfortable.

00:43:20.270 --> 00:43:21.270
Okay.

00:43:24.060 --> 00:43:29.010
That's a tricky one,
but if you recall how I did it

00:43:29.010 --> 00:43:31.008
in this conversation, I was saying

00:43:31.008 --> 00:43:35.010
that people have traumatic
experiences in the past.

00:43:35.010 --> 00:43:37.070
They have traumas
they've been through.

00:43:38.980 --> 00:43:41.260
I didn't go and say the things.

00:43:41.260 --> 00:43:43.660
Sometimes you have to, though.

00:43:43.660 --> 00:43:47.620
What you can do in those situations,
is you can provide a trigger warning

00:43:47.620 --> 00:43:51.540
or a content warning,
and try to think of a way

00:43:51.540 --> 00:43:54.090
that you can protect folks.

00:43:54.090 --> 00:43:55.100
I'll give you an example.

00:43:55.100 --> 00:43:57.510
I have to change positions people,
so my head's going to be up

00:43:57.510 --> 00:44:01.060
in here for a second.

00:44:01.060 --> 00:44:05.720
I recently did a panel
series at my work

00:44:05.720 --> 00:44:08.660
for our LGBTQ+ employer
resource group.

00:44:10.150 --> 00:44:14.980
One of the people that
I brought on is blind

00:44:14.980 --> 00:44:18.250
and his blindness was
the result of violence.

00:44:20.010 --> 00:44:22.460
What we did in this,
because he did want to talk

00:44:22.460 --> 00:44:26.720
about his story and how it happened,
is before he started talking

00:44:26.720 --> 00:44:29.200
about it, we told everyone
there, we said,

00:44:29.200 --> 00:44:34.690
"This could be potentially
triggering, due to violence.

00:44:34.690 --> 00:44:41.400
If you feel like you're
not able to listen to this,

00:44:41.400 --> 00:44:45.590
turn your speakers down
and when we are done,

00:44:45.590 --> 00:44:49.790
we'll all just wave our hands at
the screen, so that to look up."

00:44:49.790 --> 00:44:54.110
It was the only thing
that we could think to do

00:44:54.110 --> 00:44:57.650
because in order to make a
safe space for any people,

00:44:59.780 --> 00:45:02.290
sometimes you do
have to get creative.

00:45:02.290 --> 00:45:12.890
But if it's a specific resource
or course about a certain trauma

00:45:12.890 --> 00:45:17.790
or a certain issue, then I think
just providing a disclaimer

00:45:17.790 --> 00:45:20.400
in the beginning that there's
going to be discussion

00:45:20.400 --> 00:45:25.550
of triggering content, just so
people can make that decision

00:45:25.550 --> 00:45:28.050
because we don't want
to make it for them.

00:45:28.050 --> 00:45:29.690
Because there are some
people that have been

00:45:29.690 --> 00:45:33.000
through traumatic experiences and
they're okay to hear about it,

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:36.450
talk about it, they want to talk
about it, but there's others

00:45:36.450 --> 00:45:40.040
that it's just not
psychologically safe for them.

00:45:40.040 --> 00:45:42.250
I hope that answered the question.

00:45:42.250 --> 00:45:47.245
It's a little tricky to
do, but it can be done.

00:45:48.746 --> 00:45:49.320
<v Carrie> Thank you.

00:45:49.320 --> 00:45:53.900
Maybe going back to your final
point of be a good human.

00:45:53.900 --> 00:45:58.120
If you're trying to be a
good human and you are coming

00:45:58.120 --> 00:46:00.725
from a place of wanting
to be respectful,

00:46:01.959 --> 00:46:03.750
then we can give some grace

00:46:03.750 --> 00:46:05.820
to each other while we're
figuring things out.

00:46:05.820 --> 00:46:11.180
Like you said,
the gender-neutral language,

00:46:11.180 --> 00:46:14.120
I'm pretty sure the first session
I moderated a couple hours ago,

00:46:14.120 --> 00:46:16.274
I signed off by
saying, thanks guys.

00:46:16.274 --> 00:46:16.580
[laughs]

00:46:16.580 --> 00:46:22.130
<v Bela> I said it during the talk
too, and we're all going to do that.

00:46:22.130 --> 00:46:25.170
We're all learning,
we're all growing and evolving.

00:46:25.170 --> 00:46:28.790
I think the biggest
thing is just apologize

00:46:28.790 --> 00:46:32.850
if you feel it's necessary
and just try to do better.

00:46:32.850 --> 00:46:34.170
You know?

00:46:34.170 --> 00:46:37.920
Because our brains are very complex
and there's so much memory going on

00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:38.340
in there.

00:46:38.340 --> 00:46:42.460
That it's like a reaction,
it's like a knee-jerk reaction.

00:46:45.030 --> 00:46:48.430
Just try to do your best,
try to be kind to everyone.

00:46:48.430 --> 00:46:49.950
Be a good human, like that.

00:46:51.670 --> 00:46:54.630
That's my biggest
thing, just be nice.

00:46:54.630 --> 00:46:56.080
Just be a good person.

00:46:56.080 --> 00:46:57.548
[laughter].

00:46:57.548 --> 00:47:00.420
And you can solve so many
problems in the world.

00:47:00.420 --> 00:47:01.380
Oh my goodness.

00:47:01.380 --> 00:47:01.590
[laughs]

00:47:01.590 --> 00:47:03.670
<v Carrie> For sure.

00:47:03.670 --> 00:47:08.920
Thank you Bela, so much for sharing
your wisdom and your exuberance

00:47:08.920 --> 00:47:10.640
and your lived experiences.

00:47:10.640 --> 00:47:13.820
I think it always makes
things easier to understand

00:47:13.820 --> 00:47:16.240
when you have those
real-world examples

00:47:16.240 --> 00:47:20.400
and your your DJ Norby seems like a
pretty cool dude to hang out with.

00:47:20.400 --> 00:47:21.940
<v Bela> He's the best, yes.

00:47:21.940 --> 00:47:24.408
His moves,
nobody can compare to them.

00:47:24.408 --> 00:47:25.330
[laughter]

00:47:25.330 --> 00:47:29.810
<v Carrie> Oh, well, thank you
everybody for attending this session.

00:47:29.810 --> 00:47:32.070
You can continue the
conversation in the chat

00:47:32.070 --> 00:47:36.050
or on social media
using #WPA11YDay.

00:47:38.870 --> 00:47:40.400
I just say WPAlly.

00:47:40.400 --> 00:47:47.070
For anybody that doesn't know,
Y, it's got the 11 in there,

00:47:47.070 --> 00:47:50.170
there are 11 letters in the
word accessibility between the A

00:47:50.170 --> 00:47:53.180
and the Y,
so it's shortened down to that.

00:47:53.180 --> 00:47:58.200
There's also the #WPAD2022.

00:47:58.200 --> 00:48:02.750
It'll be fantastic if you could
go to wpaccessibility.day/feedback

00:48:02.750 --> 00:48:08.630
to provide anonymous feedback for
our speakers on their presentation.

00:48:08.630 --> 00:48:11.810
You can win a t-shirt
while you're there.

00:48:12.960 --> 00:48:15.350
Don't go anywhere or go
anywhere for just a few minutes.

00:48:15.350 --> 00:48:16.420
Take a break.

00:48:16.420 --> 00:48:20.300
Stay tuned for digital accessibility
testing, how to get it right,

00:48:20.300 --> 00:48:24.120
coming up next with
Tamar Shapira at Six UTC.

00:48:24.120 --> 00:48:27.380
