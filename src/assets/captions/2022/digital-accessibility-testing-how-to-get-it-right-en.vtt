00:00:31.212 --> 00:00:35.000
<v Danielle Zarcaro> Hello, welcome
to WordPress Accessibility Day.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.530
My name is Danielle, and I'm
the Founder of Overnight Website

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:43.190
and Kinetic Iris Web
Development Studio.

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.340
Thank you for joining
us for our next session,

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:52.120
Digital Accessibility Testing: How
to Get it Right, with Tamar Schapira.

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:56.830
Since 2014, Tamar has been guiding
public and private companies

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:01.400
on how to make their spaces, services
and digital offerings inclusive,

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.400
and she is now building SenseIT
to focus on eliminating the gap

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.130
between those who can and
cannot use the internet.

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.350
Please feel free to add your
questions in the Q&A tab next

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.440
to the video, and we'll answer
them at the end of the session,

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.760
and use the ideas section to
chat with other attendees.

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:21.014
Tamar, take it away.

00:01:27.341 --> 00:01:30.460
<v Tamar Schapira> Okay,
I'm going to assume so.

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.190
First of all, I'd like to
thank everyone for joining me.

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:36.560
I'm really excited to
be speaking on a topic

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.890
that I'm really passionate
about and I've been researching

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:45.310
for over a decade now, but--
Sorry, I think I'm not full screen.

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:46.730
Let me just see how.

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.809
Just a moment.

00:01:51.029 --> 00:01:52.505
Are we good to go now?

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.320
Just a moment.

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:11.620
My slides seem to be not full
screen, so just a moment.

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:36.890
My apologies, everyone.

00:02:40.527 --> 00:02:43.350
As I said, I'm very,
very excited to be here speaking

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:47.250
with you today about a topic
that I'm very excited about

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.040
and I've been researching.

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:54.770
I think you'll understand more or
less where I'm at the more we speak

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:56.330
and what I present today.

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:00.760
Before I jump into anything,
first of all, I don't know why,

00:03:00.761 --> 00:03:02.281
but I cannot move the slides.

00:03:03.317 --> 00:03:03.982
Here we go.

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:07.630
I guess I'm missing my agenda.

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:09.560
Let me tell you a
little bit about myself,

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:10.670
and then we'll jump into things.

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.580
Technical problems are always
fun, aren't they?

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:17.580
Especially when you can't see an
audience and facial expressions.

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:20.730
I'll start out by
introducing myself.

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.240
I consider myself a
social entrepreneur.

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:28.408
I've been doing business and
initiating different ideas

00:03:28.408 --> 00:03:31.720
and solutions
for the last 12 years.

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.170
Everything has an underlying
social aspect to it.

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.770
I consider myself a problem-solver
and an out-of-the-box thinker.

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:40.280
I am a morning person.

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.220
I love the morning and that
lovely, lovely smell outside

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.530
when the sun just rises.

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:49.270
I'm a runner, so you can imagine
that when I run in the morning,

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:51.540
it's one of my favorite times.

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.370
I go by the pronouns she and her,
but you'll likely hear me answering

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:59.440
to the word Ima, which is Hebrew
word for mom, more likely than not.

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:03.200
What are we going to be
speaking about today?

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:08.120
First of all, I'm going to do
about 20 to 30-minute presentation,

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:09.710
then we'll open it
up for questions.

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:14.280
I always like to speak with an
audience and answer questions.

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:19.070
I think the conversation is
a much more comfortable place

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:22.295
for all of us to
speak of accessibility

00:04:22.295 --> 00:04:24.900
and testing and the future of
and where it goes.

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:29.270
I'm going to give you my take on,
first of all, equality and equity,

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:30.250
number one.

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:33.050
Number two,
usability and accessibility.

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:36.590
Number three,
standard operating procedures.

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:39.260
Number four, I'll share with
you my thoughts on the future

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.570
of digital accessibility testing.

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:47.320
You'll also be able to see where
I'm at in my journey with SenseIT.

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:51.040
Again, before I jump into
something, my why, and tell you

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:54.210
about equality and equity,
I didn't mention that I'm the CEO

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:55.970
and Co-founder of SenseIT.

00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:00.770
At SenseIT, we are changing
or revolutionizing the way

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:04.510
that we can implement test
automation for accessibility,

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:07.100
differently than what
we've done until today,

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:12.080
in that we are simulating
the user's experience

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:15.610
from an accessibility/disability
perspective.

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:19.310
Without further ado,
I'm going to jump right in.

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:22.570
I know you'll have a lot of
questions for me because testing

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:27.730
and automated and accessibility
haven't gone together very smoothly

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:30.080
in the last few years,
as we probably all know.

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:36.210
Before I go into my topic of
testing, my why.

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:38.340
This picture,
I'm showing a picture on a slide

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:40.670
of three people overlooking
a baseball game.

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:43.450
A lot of you probably are
familiar with this image,

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:47.400
and I just love to present
it before I explain my take

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:54.690
on accessibility testing because
it frames how I view the world

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:56.560
and where I'm coming from.

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:01.140
In this image,
we have a wall that blocks the crowd

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:06.270
or these three people
looking at the baseball game.

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:09.080
We have three different
heights, a tall person,

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:11.890
a middle-height person,
and a shorter person,

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:18.320
and they all are standing on a
box to be able to see the game,

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:20.430
or a booster, we can call it.

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:21.921
This is a form of equality

00:06:21.922 --> 00:06:24.560
where we've given
everyone the same solution

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:28.460
because we see that there is one
person, or rather in this case,

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:31.430
there would be two people that
can't actually see the game

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:33.140
from their own height.

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:37.740
Now the solution, as we see
here, allowed the tall person

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:40.470
and the middle-height person
to see the game, but the person

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:43.060
who's shorter still
can't see the game.

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:47.260
We move over to what we call
equity, which is allowing everybody

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:52.370
to see the game as they
can in their perspective,

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:55.740
but by giving solutions that
are customized or solutions

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:57.920
that are best fit for them.

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:02.780
Therefore, in this image-- My
slides keep jumping, I apologize.

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:06.290
In this image, we can see that the
tall person doesn't have that booster

00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:08.300
because he or she can see.

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:10.592
The middle-height
person has one booster

00:07:10.593 --> 00:07:12.380
and then they can see the game.

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:15.170
The shortest person
receives two boosters

00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:16.920
because now they can see the game.

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:19.490
Actually, they're all of
equal height now that everyone

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:21.320
was given their own solution.

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:28.650
This is a great form of offering
solutions that would fit a person.

00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:30.780
Therefore, we're seeking equity.

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:34.750
When I'm viewing accessibility and
specifically, digital accessibility

00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:36.321
and how I perceive the world,

00:07:36.322 --> 00:07:38.760
I'd like to remove the
systematic barriers.

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:42.100
I believe that this is the
best form of accessibility;

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:44.880
when we no longer have a wall,
but we could put up a fence,

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:47.270
and then nobody needs
a specific solution,

00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:49.450
or a customized solution, rather.

00:07:49.450 --> 00:07:53.540
There are no barriers to stop
them from viewing the game,

00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:56.060
and everyone can see from
their own perspective.

00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:57.060
Oh, and we're jumping.

00:07:58.130 --> 00:08:02.900
Now when speaking of
accessibility, I always tell people

00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:06.450
that don't know much about
accessibility, that accessibility

00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:08.840
and usability go hand in hand.

00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:10.380
Why do I say that?

00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:12.240
Some of you are probably
familiar with this,

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:15.690
and I'm probably preaching
here to the crowd, but I feel

00:08:15.690 --> 00:08:20.610
that it's important anyway
to emphasize this point,

00:08:20.610 --> 00:08:24.640
that when speaking of accessibility,
we're speaking of users

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:28.930
that have specific needs
or-- I'm losing the word.

00:08:33.850 --> 00:08:35.440
I just lost the word, sorry.

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:39.500
Sometimes being bilingual affects.

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:42.020
Anyway, we'll go back.

00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:46.150
Accessibility is the use
of specifically for people

00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:48.090
that have disabilities.

00:08:48.090 --> 00:08:51.110
When we speak about accessibility,
we always preach that

00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:54.500
when you implement accessibility,
in essence you're allowing

00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:57.970
a more simplified
usability for your product.

00:08:57.970 --> 00:09:02.020
If you're implementing
usability, but you haven't taken

00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:05.620
into account accessibility,
then you're actually missing one part

00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:06.780
of usability.

00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:11.620
Therefore, I see a correlation,
and I work alongside the correlation

00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:12.700
between the two.

00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:14.190
I don't separate them.

00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:16.430
Be interesting to hear from
you if there's anything

00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:18.720
that you think differently here.

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:22.760
If I deep dive or dive a little
deeper into the definition

00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:29.290
of usability according to the W3C, it
states that usability is the extent

00:09:29.290 --> 00:09:32.160
to which a product can
be used by specific users

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:34.559
to achieve specific
goals effectively,

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:39.180
efficiently and with satisfaction
in a specified context of use.

00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:44.740
Now if we look at the highlighted,
I have a few words here

00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:50.490
that are highlighted: specified
users, and specified context of use.

00:09:50.490 --> 00:09:54.980
If I look at those specifically
from an accessibility point of view,

00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:58.880
then specified users,
in the definition of usability

00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:02.610
from an accessibility perspective,
would include people with a range

00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:05.030
of disabilities or capabilities.

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:09.760
Specified context of use would
include accessibility considerations

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:12.280
such as assistive technologies.

00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:15.290
Therefore, the two go hand in
hand, as I see it.

00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:19.090
I don't feel I need
to go into the WCAG.

00:10:19.090 --> 00:10:21.680
I'm sure that everyone
here is familiar with it.

00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:24.290
If it's the first time you're
hearing of digital accessibility

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:30.630
in my presentation here,
then I suggest that you find the map

00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:36.180
by Intopia,
the WCAG map by digital Intopia.

00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:46.340
I think it outlines the way
that the WCAG is formatted

00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:50.610
in a much more simplified way
so that you can understand,

00:10:50.610 --> 00:10:54.900
when we speak of accessibility
testing, how we're approaching it.

00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:58.740
This is the reason that I
always add this map here

00:10:58.740 --> 00:11:04.930
because I think it's a much more
effective way to explain to somebody

00:11:04.930 --> 00:11:09.740
who may not know what accessibility
is and what are the guidelines,

00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:13.050
or where to even begin
with accessibility testing.

00:11:13.050 --> 00:11:15.440
I think this breaks
it down very nicely.

00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:20.800
I continue, when I present to
people that don't necessarily know

00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:23.233
what the WCAG is,
and I might be assuming

00:11:23.234 --> 00:11:24.970
that everyone here does know,

00:11:25.451 --> 00:11:28.440
I break it down
according to the map.

00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:33.610
We have the four principles of
the WCAG, and within the four-

00:11:33.610 --> 00:11:37.790
the four principles are allocated
into three conformance levels.

00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:45.070
Oftentimes, I hear, "My
organization needs WCAG AA and 2.1.

00:11:45.070 --> 00:11:52.310
Is that what you cover?" I emphasize
that if you're looking for AA,

00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:56.070
which we all know is
more or less the standard

00:11:56.070 --> 00:12:01.720
or that average recommendation to
make sure that you're conforming to,

00:12:02.810 --> 00:12:06.730
then one must understand that
you have to cover level A,

00:12:06.730 --> 00:12:11.960
which is our critical criteria,
and the AA in order to say

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:16.220
that you're conforming
to AA guidelines.

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:20.280
AAA, as we know and I'm
sure that we've heard it

00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:23.570
in the last two days,
is much more strict.

00:12:23.570 --> 00:12:26.000
Generally, we're talking
about federal government

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.480
and federally funded organizations.

00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:31.230
It's the highest
level of conformance.

00:12:31.230 --> 00:12:35.480
I would hope that that's where we're
going to reach in the near future,

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:38.330
but I also understand,
and you'll see it later on,

00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:41.130
that accessibility tends to
be something that not a lot

00:12:41.130 --> 00:12:46.190
of people understand and they
have the motivation to do so.

00:12:46.190 --> 00:12:49.410
Therefore,
we need to find a happy medium.

00:12:49.410 --> 00:12:54.940
What can we require that
will remove barriers,

00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:59.540
but also allow companies,
organizations, product owners,

00:12:59.540 --> 00:13:05.960
website owners to continue building
without having to constantly worry

00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:09.090
that they're not meeting the
highest level of conformance?

00:13:09.090 --> 00:13:10.220
That's the way that I view it.

00:13:11.350 --> 00:13:13.960
Of course, I break this down
into the success criteria so

00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:17.060
that we can understand that
if you have to cover A and AA,

00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:19.830
then you're actually
covering 50 success criteria.

00:13:19.830 --> 00:13:24.910
I'm always asked the question,
how much do you cover?

00:13:24.910 --> 00:13:30.530
We, of course, are in the test
automation space, and the percent

00:13:30.530 --> 00:13:33.120
of coverage is something
that worries everybody

00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:36.900
because if you don't cover
100%, then it's useless.

00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:38.660
Well, I don't believe that.

00:13:38.660 --> 00:13:42.470
I believe that what we need
to find is a way to test

00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:48.280
and assess for accessibility
that will allow the professionals

00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:52.260
in our space to do
the work of an expert.

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:55.070
Which is what we call them,
subject-matter experts.

00:13:55.070 --> 00:13:59.520
My team, we have subject-matter
experts, and I see the complexity

00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:05.040
of what- the complex issues
that we can solve versus issues

00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:09.310
that may be able to be solved
by test automation, not

00:14:09.310 --> 00:14:13.330
to cover this 100%,
rather to be able to say,

00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:15.420
"Okay, we have 50 success criteria.

00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:17.880
We know that one of
them needs 10 tests.

00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:23.240
Those 10 tests were covered while
we were still in pre-production."

00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:24.620
I hope I haven't lost anyone yet.

00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:28.110
If it's a little too technical,
I'm happy to slow down afterwards

00:14:28.110 --> 00:14:29.110
and answer your questions.

00:14:31.370 --> 00:14:34.220
Now, my black box.

00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:38.820
When I speak to clients or
prospects or partners, or anybody

00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:40.470
who wants to understand
what we're doing,

00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:44.800
what digital accessibility
is, I like to take the example

00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:49.130
of the black box; being the
box that we don't really know

00:14:49.130 --> 00:14:53.100
what's inside and we don't
really understand it.

00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:57.080
It's there, and we know that
we have to have it in place,

00:14:57.080 --> 00:15:02.050
but it's kind of that world
that we don't really understand.

00:15:02.050 --> 00:15:06.060
I feel accessibility tends to
be that way for a lot of people

00:15:07.310 --> 00:15:12.770
in the product teams,
if it's product or developers,

00:15:12.770 --> 00:15:17.340
sometimes designers as well
and the QA, quality assurance.

00:15:17.340 --> 00:15:21.960
I feel this space tends
to be a black box to them.

00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:24.320
It's one of the reasons,
or at least this is what I like

00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:30.130
to believe in the way that I'm
leading this, that they want

00:15:30.130 --> 00:15:32.300
to implement accessibility,
but they don't really know

00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:36.360
how to because it's left in the
hands of professionals and experts.

00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:41.170
I do feel accessibility
tends to be convoluted.

00:15:41.170 --> 00:15:42.290
It's complex.

00:15:42.290 --> 00:15:48.540
Not a lot of people understand
what really needs to be done,

00:15:48.540 --> 00:15:51.280
and they have the
motivation to do so.

00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:56.690
My suggestion is always to
start at the beginning, and try

00:15:56.690 --> 00:15:59.640
to implement some sort of
standard operating procedure

00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:04.810
within an organization that will
allude to how a product needs

00:16:04.810 --> 00:16:09.140
to be tested, assessed and
monitored for accessibility.

00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:14.640
This is really the beginning,
the baby steps for testing,

00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:15.460
at the end of the day.

00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:20.780
Because I can offer an
organization a tool and tell them,

00:16:20.780 --> 00:16:24.230
"Use this and cover your
accessibility grounds,"

00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:30.840
but that's not really where my
tool is going to be most effective.

00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:35.430
My tool or my product is
going to be most effective

00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:39.890
for an organization that has
already implemented the idea

00:16:39.890 --> 00:16:42.380
of accessibility across the board.

00:16:42.380 --> 00:16:47.060
Meaning, the design and
development team understand

00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:49.760
and have some sort of
training in place or a program

00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:51.740
in place for accessibility.

00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:56.250
Some sort of a guideline,
not the WCAG, internal policy

00:16:56.250 --> 00:16:58.660
for what is the expectation.

00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:03.400
The business stakeholders within
the company have buy-in also

00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:05.920
to these either standard
operating procedures

00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:08.420
or the accessibility programs.

00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:14.970
Only then do I believe that
a testing tool can assist

00:17:14.970 --> 00:17:17.260
and can support the efforts
of the organization.

00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:22.320
I always turn to-- I call it the
standard operating procedure.

00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:25.890
We can call it guidelines,
we can call it standards

00:17:25.890 --> 00:17:32.400
or internal company
policies for accessibility.

00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:37.010
Then accessibility
testing can be implemented

00:17:37.010 --> 00:17:39.530
and the accessibility
can be monitored.

00:17:39.530 --> 00:17:45.430
When I speak of organizations or
products, I'm referring primarily

00:17:45.430 --> 00:17:47.540
to web applications.

00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:53.520
In the world of websites,
because we are in WordPress Day,

00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:55.830
the websites that I
would be referring

00:17:55.830 --> 00:17:58.990
to are more complex e-commerce
sites, sites that have a lot

00:17:58.990 --> 00:18:00.540
of functionality in them.

00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:04.290
That's where I come from
when I'm viewing or speaking

00:18:04.290 --> 00:18:06.900
of accessibility testing.

00:18:08.430 --> 00:18:09.230
Then we'll begin.

00:18:09.230 --> 00:18:10.730
I hope that was clear for everyone.

00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:17.540
I always begin-- Now, I'm going
to give a few criteria or tests

00:18:17.540 --> 00:18:21.420
that should be implemented
pre-production, that we call them

00:18:21.420 --> 00:18:26.470
the critical mass before you
can even release your product,

00:18:26.470 --> 00:18:29.140
but that maybe you can
do this automatically.

00:18:29.140 --> 00:18:31.280
This is what we're trying to
test at SenseIT, and this is

00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:34.470
what I'm trying to
bring to the world.

00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:39.160
There are critical tests
that should be implemented

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:41.370
before you release a product.

00:18:41.370 --> 00:18:46.540
We understand that there's a way
that the manual testing techniques

00:18:46.540 --> 00:18:49.080
that we've implemented
for all these years

00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:53.160
might be slowing down
the release cycles.

00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:58.230
Therefore, we're coming out with
ways that we can implement testing

00:18:58.230 --> 00:19:02.610
within development,
offering that heavy lift

00:19:02.610 --> 00:19:06.230
of what a manual tester would
be doing, in order to assure

00:19:06.230 --> 00:19:09.450
that there are no barriers
initially when released.

00:19:09.450 --> 00:19:14.810
Doesn't mean that we don't need
testing post-release, but the issues

00:19:14.810 --> 00:19:20.470
that can be found later on are
not stopping or barriers to use

00:19:20.470 --> 00:19:22.450
for people with disabilities.

00:19:22.450 --> 00:19:24.980
The first one that I start
with is keyboard functionality.

00:19:24.980 --> 00:19:27.540
I love this image because
I feel it explains

00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:32.030
that keyboard functionality is
not only addressing the population

00:19:32.030 --> 00:19:35.460
of people with disabilities,
rather there are people that prefer

00:19:35.460 --> 00:19:38.530
to use keyboard,
there are people or smaller humans

00:19:38.530 --> 00:19:42.390
that have an easier
time using a keyboard.

00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:44.620
Just like when we speak of
the population of people

00:19:44.620 --> 00:19:48.030
with disabilities,
sometimes you can't use the keyboard.

00:19:48.030 --> 00:19:51.390
Sometimes your functions don't allow
you to use-- I'm sorry, a mouse.

00:19:51.390 --> 00:19:54.880
Sometimes your functionality
doesn't allow you to use a mouse

00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:56.930
and therefore,
keyboard functionality has

00:19:56.930 --> 00:19:59.730
to be implemented the same
way that we do a mouse.

00:19:59.730 --> 00:20:02.260
If I go back to square
one, what does that mean?

00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:04.410
When we have a click of a
mouse, we need to make sure

00:20:04.410 --> 00:20:06.500
that it functions
correctly with a keyboard.

00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:12.560
Not only the function of the
actual element, the button,

00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:16.050
where if you need to
press the Submit button

00:20:16.050 --> 00:20:20.930
or click the Submit button,
the Submit button has to be pressable

00:20:20.930 --> 00:20:26.790
by the keyboard, but you also
have to be able to navigate to

00:20:26.790 --> 00:20:28.180
and from the keyboard.

00:20:28.180 --> 00:20:29.350
How do we test for that?

00:20:29.350 --> 00:20:30.550
We have to use the product.

00:20:30.550 --> 00:20:33.660
This is part of what we're
doing with the simulator.

00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:36.936
We're trying to change the behavior

00:20:36.936 --> 00:20:41.480
of existing functional
testing scripts

00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:44.770
to simulate the way
that we would test it

00:20:44.770 --> 00:20:48.860
from a keyboard functionality,
keyboard navigation,

00:20:48.860 --> 00:20:53.430
keyboard Enter perspective,
as part of these success criteria.

00:20:53.430 --> 00:20:54.970
That's number one.

00:20:54.970 --> 00:20:58.280
If we dive a little bit deeper
and we go into this menu,

00:21:01.620 --> 00:21:06.900
then here we have an
example of a dropdown menu.

00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:09.050
We can see that we
have the icons on top.

00:21:09.050 --> 00:21:14.140
I place the focus on
the dropdown menu itself

00:21:14.140 --> 00:21:15.780
so we could see the items.

00:21:15.780 --> 00:21:19.390
In this case, we need to make
sure that we can navigate to

00:21:19.390 --> 00:21:25.640
and from the top menu,
open up the dropdown menu,

00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:28.620
and then we can actually
navigate within the menu

00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:32.050
so that we can reach, let's
say, my nutrition insights.

00:21:32.050 --> 00:21:35.060
By the way, this is the Kroger
website, if anybody just shopped

00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:40.780
at Kroger and recognizes
it, so this is a snippet.

00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:45.100
It's not to come and show
issues, rather it's to just come

00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:49.620
and show what we are looking for when
we speak of keyboard functionality.

00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:53.150
As you know, you have to be able
to go through the entire menu.

00:21:53.150 --> 00:21:58.470
Then, of course, you'll see in
the next few slides, the tests

00:21:58.470 --> 00:22:00.660
that also have to be implemented
not only to make sure

00:22:00.660 --> 00:22:05.190
that the keyboard works,
but that we have focus and whatnot.

00:22:05.190 --> 00:22:09.110
If I take a moment here and
I jump over to my suggestions

00:22:09.110 --> 00:22:14.620
for learning how to test
or understanding what needs

00:22:14.620 --> 00:22:19.190
to be done with assessments,
not only by using a tool,

00:22:19.190 --> 00:22:22.770
and not only by reading the
WCAG, but really trying

00:22:22.770 --> 00:22:26.610
to understand and implement
design as a first step

00:22:26.610 --> 00:22:29.790
within your organization,
we always recommend

00:22:29.790 --> 00:22:36.700
the Accessibility Design Patterns,
the APG that can be found online.

00:22:36.700 --> 00:22:42.610
The W3C created this website where
I really think that it speaks

00:22:42.610 --> 00:22:48.800
to the design and development
teams to really understand

00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:50.130
what needs to be done.

00:22:50.130 --> 00:22:54.020
I still think there's a lot
of information here that may

00:22:54.020 --> 00:22:57.630
or may not be understood
unless someone

00:22:57.630 --> 00:23:01.220
within an organization is
dedicated to accessibility.

00:23:02.350 --> 00:23:06.620
Yet, we still suggest that if you're
looking for keyboard functionality,

00:23:06.620 --> 00:23:10.450
and we have the menu,
the menu bar and buttons,

00:23:10.450 --> 00:23:13.730
then there's ways to really
understand how to implement this

00:23:13.730 --> 00:23:16.310
from the beginning.

00:23:16.310 --> 00:23:19.820
That's why I always
recommend clients,

00:23:19.820 --> 00:23:25.220
whether or not you use our
platform, or you've decided

00:23:25.220 --> 00:23:31.260
to manually test every
process, turning to

00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:35.030
the accessibility design
guidelines will really,

00:23:35.030 --> 00:23:38.990
really give you a leverage and
a kick-start on making sure

00:23:38.990 --> 00:23:41.910
that the rest of your
elements or the components

00:23:41.910 --> 00:23:45.810
that you're building will be
accessible from the design phases.

00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:53.000
The next criteria and
set of criteria and tests

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.490
that we speak about are
assistive technologies.

00:23:55.490 --> 00:23:59.870
Of course, keyboard covers the need,
it's also an assistive technology

00:23:59.870 --> 00:24:03.920
from our view,
but here we're talking specifically

00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:08.310
about external technologies such
as the infamous screen reader,

00:24:08.310 --> 00:24:11.330
which behaves in a certain way.

00:24:11.330 --> 00:24:14.520
We need to make sure that
the product is going to-

00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:19.850
the expected behavior out of
elements will also be utilized

00:24:19.850 --> 00:24:24.170
or usable by assistive
technologies.

00:24:24.170 --> 00:24:26.540
Therefore,
we start with name and role.

00:24:26.540 --> 00:24:31.640
If we remember the slide that
I showed with the dropdown menu

00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:37.020
for keyboard functionality,
the icons had the labels under them.

00:24:38.150 --> 00:24:42.680
That, of course, we can see
that I've blacked out the names

00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:49.700
to focus here on
what we are missing.

00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:53.058
Because technically,
if a screen reader is navigating

00:24:53.058 --> 00:24:58.500
through this page, the screen reader
will read out what it can pick up.

00:24:58.500 --> 00:25:05.120
If these icons don't have some sort
of a label or a name implemented,

00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:07.130
then the screen reader is
not going to pick it up.

00:25:07.130 --> 00:25:10.290
What's more,
if I'm not using a screen reader

00:25:10.290 --> 00:25:12.860
and I'm just using this,
and I want something

00:25:12.860 --> 00:25:17.230
that's a little bit more simple
to use and understandable, hence,

00:25:17.230 --> 00:25:22.610
accessible, then having these
icons doesn't necessarily allude

00:25:22.610 --> 00:25:23.850
to what they're doing.

00:25:23.850 --> 00:25:25.230
I have to guess.

00:25:25.230 --> 00:25:32.400
Now, I think part of the reason that
accessibility is not a given has

00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:34.850
to do with the generation
that we're in today,

00:25:34.850 --> 00:25:40.030
where the digital transformation
over the last 20 years has allowed us

00:25:40.030 --> 00:25:44.640
to raise the next generation to
understanding what everything means.

00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:49.420
Three dots means it's a menu,
somebody that looks like a person

00:25:49.420 --> 00:25:51.670
must be your sign-in
or your account.

00:25:51.670 --> 00:25:57.820
If it's a cart, then it must
be where all of my shopping,

00:25:57.820 --> 00:26:01.040
the purchases go for.

00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:04.680
Accessibility doesn't assume.

00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:12.040
We assume that the user
doesn't know and therefore,

00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:13.470
we want to simplify it.

00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:17.540
This is something that
I always allude to.

00:26:17.540 --> 00:26:21.680
Of course, I take everyone back--
Oh, I missed a slide.

00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:26.680
This is another one that I usually
recommend our clients to go back

00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:29.860
and to read a little bit about name
and role and to better understand

00:26:29.860 --> 00:26:33.790
what can be implemented, of course,
with keeping your design in mind.

00:26:35.100 --> 00:26:40.020
If I move on, focus order tends
to be a little bit confusing

00:26:40.020 --> 00:26:43.330
when I speak to people that
don't know accessibility.

00:26:43.330 --> 00:26:46.080
That's primarily because
a lot of people think that

00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:51.270
if I've already clicked on the
sign-in icon or pressed on it

00:26:51.270 --> 00:26:57.510
with my Enter key and the
drop dropdown menu works,

00:26:57.510 --> 00:26:59.560
then we're good to go.

00:26:59.560 --> 00:27:02.740
You want somebody to navigate
through your dropdown menu.

00:27:02.740 --> 00:27:04.620
How are they going to do that?

00:27:04.620 --> 00:27:08.340
It's great that you're tabbing
through, but if the focus is not

00:27:08.340 --> 00:27:11.760
being tabbed through and you
actually have to use your arrow keys,

00:27:12.810 --> 00:27:15.833
then this dropdown
menu is inaccessible,

00:27:15.834 --> 00:27:16.910
and you've actually missed

00:27:16.910 --> 00:27:20.650
the whole point of what you've
done with your keyboard navigation.

00:27:20.650 --> 00:27:26.720
This is another test that we find
it's super critical for a product

00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:30.760
to go through pre-production.

00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:34.240
It's also something that we've
implemented within SenseIT,

00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:38.200
understanding that it's one of the
more critical tests that we used

00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:41.160
to do manually,
and we'd like to see that this is

00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:49.520
just navigating through all elements
on a page and able to focus,

00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:54.580
the keyboard can focus on the
elements that it needs to.

00:27:54.580 --> 00:27:58.410
That was a lot of information,
and I always love to talk about this.

00:27:58.410 --> 00:28:03.250
I try to keep it at the higher
level rather than go technical.

00:28:03.250 --> 00:28:06.440
My background, by the way,
is not of a subject-matter expert.

00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:09.480
I've learned everything that
I've learned through doing

00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:12.800
and through speaking to people and
through reading, and I keep learning.

00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:16.780
If there's anything here that you
feel that I should expand upon

00:28:16.780 --> 00:28:20.560
or that I should add to,
please, by all means, add it

00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:24.690
to the comments or we can
discuss it afterwards.

00:28:24.690 --> 00:28:26.630
I'm happy to take your thoughts.

00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:33.680
Finally, if I spoke all this time
about SenseIT and what I believe

00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:37.883
that combination
between test automation,

00:28:37.883 --> 00:28:40.419
the world of test automation
and accessibility,

00:28:40.419 --> 00:28:42.390
I'll give you a
little bit of a hint

00:28:42.390 --> 00:28:45.370
to where I see the future of
accessibility testing and what it is

00:28:45.370 --> 00:28:48.860
that we're trying to do at SenseIT.

00:28:48.860 --> 00:28:52.440
Which is really to fill
that gap or mind the gap

00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:57.940
between the test automation that's
implemented in organizations

00:28:57.940 --> 00:29:02.360
to test functionality and
performance and security and whatnot,

00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:06.480
and then what we see as kind of
the stepbrother of accessibility.

00:29:07.550 --> 00:29:11.380
We no longer want accessibility
to be left behind at all.

00:29:11.380 --> 00:29:17.820
It has to keep up with the speed
of development, with the world

00:29:17.820 --> 00:29:23.130
of DevOps and the cloud, and
everywhere that technology is going,

00:29:23.130 --> 00:29:27.090
accessibility has to
be implemented within.

00:29:27.090 --> 00:29:31.490
It has to be integrated
into the development cycle,

00:29:31.490 --> 00:29:36.350
and I think it's a huge
part of product development.

00:29:36.350 --> 00:29:40.850
I believe that in the future,
organizations are going to understand

00:29:40.850 --> 00:29:47.170
that accessibility positively affects
usability, and they will be able

00:29:47.170 --> 00:29:50.003
to measure the
positive ROI that comes

00:29:50.004 --> 00:29:52.400
from implementing accessibility.

00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:56.060
However, with that being
said, I don't believe

00:29:56.060 --> 00:29:59.421
that accessibility
can be truly measured

00:29:59.422 --> 00:30:02.900
before it is truly integrated
into development.

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:06.840
In a moment, I'll explain to
you my view of integrating

00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:12.640
into the development cycle,
but when I speak of accessibility

00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:16.840
being integrated,
I mean that on a high level,

00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:20.500
the business stakeholders
understand that accessibility

00:30:20.500 --> 00:30:24.850
is an integral part of their
organization, digital accessibility.

00:30:24.850 --> 00:30:31.450
Because without it, you're not
moving forward, you're not going

00:30:31.450 --> 00:30:36.710
to allow your consumers to
enjoy or to reap the benefits

00:30:36.710 --> 00:30:38.090
of what you're offering.

00:30:38.090 --> 00:30:41.930
Because at the end of the day,
accessibility is a growing market,

00:30:41.930 --> 00:30:46.230
or the population of people with
disabilities is a growing population,

00:30:46.230 --> 00:30:49.480
whether we want to believe it or
not, but that's reality.

00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:56.090
If I come into what we're trying
to do here with SenseIT is

00:30:56.090 --> 00:30:59.220
to really take a traditional
development cycle,

00:30:59.220 --> 00:31:04.780
where you can see this is a
diagram of a high-level process

00:31:04.780 --> 00:31:06.800
of development build.

00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:10.030
I generally have two slides showing
that automatic testing comes

00:31:10.030 --> 00:31:15.400
after build, and then we have manual
accessibility testing before release,

00:31:16.460 --> 00:31:17.440
if at all.

00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:21.860
What I'm showing in this
diagram is that we are combining

00:31:21.860 --> 00:31:25.710
or we're creating a process
where automatic testing

00:31:25.710 --> 00:31:30.250
for accessibility is done
simultaneous to automatic testing

00:31:30.250 --> 00:31:33.100
for mainstream users.

00:31:33.100 --> 00:31:37.370
Therefore, this is allowing
accessibility testing,

00:31:37.370 --> 00:31:40.470
critical accessibility testing
to be implemented pre-release.

00:31:40.470 --> 00:31:44.040
Again, this automatic testing for
accessibility that we're doing

00:31:44.040 --> 00:31:45.850
in SenseIT is a simulator.

00:31:45.850 --> 00:31:49.500
It takes into account keyboard
navigation by interacting

00:31:49.500 --> 00:31:53.790
with the product, which is really
not something that we've seen

00:31:53.790 --> 00:31:55.290
until now.

00:31:56.400 --> 00:31:59.450
It's one of the main reasons
that I believe this can have

00:31:59.450 --> 00:32:02.290
a positive effect on what we're
trying to do in accessibility

00:32:02.290 --> 00:32:10.130
because we won't forego that
interactive element of testing.

00:32:10.130 --> 00:32:12.090
The whole idea is to come
in to change the approach

00:32:12.090 --> 00:32:13.370
to digital accessibility.

00:32:13.370 --> 00:32:17.030
I mentioned it in the beginning,
where we find that organizations

00:32:17.030 --> 00:32:19.080
that are mature enough to
understand that they need

00:32:19.080 --> 00:32:21.610
to implement some sort
of accessibility program

00:32:21.610 --> 00:32:25.220
or standard operating
procedures for accessibility,

00:32:25.220 --> 00:32:31.680
can accept a platform that can
leverage the existing tests

00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:35.430
that they're already doing and
execute them as accessibility tests.

00:32:35.430 --> 00:32:39.890
They can implement or
execute automatic assessments

00:32:39.890 --> 00:32:44.200
by using a simulator that we have
to offer, but also understand

00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:45.700
that it's not the end of the road.

00:32:45.700 --> 00:32:48.300
This is not the be-all and
end-all for accessibility testing,

00:32:48.300 --> 00:32:52.480
rather it's a really great start
for them to release products

00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:57.010
that have limited barriers
or no critical barriers.

00:32:57.010 --> 00:33:01.060
Then, of course, in the way of
technology, we need to make sure

00:33:01.060 --> 00:33:05.960
that companies will adopt such
a tool or such a platform.

00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:10.240
Therefore, we really need to make
sure that accessibility speaks

00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:15.620
to the non-accessibility
professionals or personnel

00:33:15.620 --> 00:33:16.960
within an organization.

00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:21.280
Therefore, it needs to be simply
integrated into existing processes,

00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:27.850
and simply used or the way
it's set up and then used needs

00:33:27.850 --> 00:33:30.929
to be something that
is not too complex

00:33:30.930 --> 00:33:33.470
and doesn't disturb the process.

00:33:34.700 --> 00:33:37.190
This is part of my
research and development.

00:33:37.190 --> 00:33:40.040
Like I said, I believe accessibility
is usability for people

00:33:40.040 --> 00:33:41.180
with disabilities.

00:33:41.180 --> 00:33:46.410
Doing this on a continuous
basis is only going to ensure

00:33:46.410 --> 00:33:49.420
that the future of the digital
world is, in fact, accessible,

00:33:49.420 --> 00:33:54.010
and we don't have any barriers
because there's no need.

00:33:54.010 --> 00:33:54.400
Thank you.

00:34:00.141 --> 00:34:02.050
<v Danielle> Awesome,
really great job.

00:34:02.050 --> 00:34:05.050
Thank you so much
for the presentation.

00:34:05.050 --> 00:34:10.580
Just as a reminder, we have the
Q&A tab next to the live stream

00:34:10.580 --> 00:34:12.300
so that you can
enter your questions.

00:34:13.410 --> 00:34:14.800
We do have a few in.

00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:21.510
The first one is, how much modeling
is required for each unit test case?

00:34:21.510 --> 00:34:25.280
Do you need to specify an entire
test path, starting, ending point,

00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:26.097
et cetera?

00:34:26.765 --> 00:34:29.780
<v Tamar> It's a really great
question, Lucy, thank you.

00:34:29.780 --> 00:34:32.590
The idea is to leverage
existing tests.

00:34:32.590 --> 00:34:35.960
You don't have to model,
and you don't have

00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:41.300
to recreate any test
cases or any script.

00:34:41.300 --> 00:34:44.030
Right now, and I'm happy to
share, we're working

00:34:44.030 --> 00:34:47.390
with Selenium-based scripts
and of course, we're moving

00:34:47.390 --> 00:34:50.890
into more frameworks,
but it's language-agnostic.

00:34:50.890 --> 00:34:56.690
Really, if you have a script,
then you can run it through SenseIT.

00:34:56.690 --> 00:35:01.610
Then we change the behavior in an
automatic fashion of the elements

00:35:01.610 --> 00:35:03.410
so that we can test accessibility.

00:35:03.410 --> 00:35:05.310
I hope that answers your question
because I'm thinking that

00:35:05.310 --> 00:35:08.280
maybe you're alluding to something
else, but I'm happy to answer more

00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:09.280
if you have.

00:35:10.009 --> 00:35:12.919
<v Danielle> Yes, we'll see if
there's a follow-up on that one.

00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:15.430
Another question.

00:35:15.430 --> 00:35:17.682
Once a product or
website goes live,

00:35:17.683 --> 00:35:21.700
how often do you run maintenance
accessibility scans to make sure

00:35:21.700 --> 00:35:25.710
that everything remains at
the same level of compliance?

00:35:25.710 --> 00:35:28.560
Is it something you
build into the process?

00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:29.294
<v Tamar> Yes.

00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:32.720
I see it's Lucy.

00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:35.113
What's important to
understand is that

00:35:35.114 --> 00:35:37.200
we're not a service organization,

00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:42.550
so I don't offer clients a number
of times or when we're going

00:35:42.550 --> 00:35:43.710
to run maintenance.

00:35:43.710 --> 00:35:47.360
What we recommend, and it depends
on the size of the organization,

00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:51.330
is that accessibility is run as
often as regression testing is run.

00:35:51.330 --> 00:35:54.910
It really depends on, again,
the size of the organization,

00:35:54.910 --> 00:35:57.060
the optimization that
they're looking for,

00:35:57.060 --> 00:36:01.040
because adding accessibility
testing, even automatic, will delay

00:36:01.040 --> 00:36:05.230
some of the testing because
it still takes time.

00:36:05.230 --> 00:36:07.870
It's different than clicking,
you have to navigate through.

00:36:07.870 --> 00:36:15.150
The system does run slower than what
a generic testing system would run.

00:36:15.150 --> 00:36:19.550
We tend to recommend that they
do it as often as they can

00:36:19.550 --> 00:36:24.420
because then you're going to
catch issues faster, fix them.

00:36:24.420 --> 00:36:28.400
In terms of websites that are
more static, I don't think

00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:30.100
that it needs to be run as much.

00:36:30.100 --> 00:36:33.850
You can probably do it as much
as you either change the content

00:36:33.850 --> 00:36:38.010
or have a process in place
once a quarter or so.

00:36:38.010 --> 00:36:39.550
Again, it just depends.

00:36:39.550 --> 00:36:40.200
The more the merrier.

00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:42.770
It needs to be done all the
time, as far as I'm concerned.

00:36:42.770 --> 00:36:44.790
It's just a matter of
when you start and-- Yes.

00:36:47.726 --> 00:36:50.770
<v Danielle> At what
size of a company?

00:36:50.770 --> 00:36:54.050
Is this a starting-from-the-beginning
process?

00:36:54.050 --> 00:36:58.080
Does this work on existing
things that they're now starting

00:36:58.080 --> 00:36:59.860
to implement a process for testing?

00:36:59.860 --> 00:37:03.310
When does this type of
automated testing work best?

00:37:03.310 --> 00:37:06.260
Is it start from
scratch new project?

00:37:06.260 --> 00:37:08.740
Can you integrate it into
something that's already existing?

00:37:08.740 --> 00:37:10.061
<v Tamar> Yes, it's both.

00:37:10.061 --> 00:37:11.362
It's both.

00:37:14.302 --> 00:37:17.168
It's easier to speak
of such a product

00:37:17.168 --> 00:37:24.230
with the more mature companies, the
largest of enterprises of the world.

00:37:24.230 --> 00:37:28.670
With that being said,
the future of SenseIT

00:37:28.670 --> 00:37:32.970
and how I see it is that the
companies that are like WordPress,

00:37:32.970 --> 00:37:39.010
and Shopify, and SAP, and
Salesforce, all of the frameworks

00:37:39.010 --> 00:37:42.040
of the foundations
of what we build on,

00:37:42.040 --> 00:37:44.870
because if we consider
ourselves creators,

00:37:44.870 --> 00:37:48.290
then the creators will have
the opportunity to assess

00:37:48.290 --> 00:37:49.970
what SenseIT has implemented.

00:37:49.970 --> 00:37:52.620
It's something that you
can continuously test.

00:37:52.620 --> 00:37:57.340
I know that it's very
tedious to try to understand

00:37:57.340 --> 00:37:59.990
how much can we test and what is
the minimum that we have to do.

00:37:59.990 --> 00:38:02.550
Again, it needs to
be done all the time.

00:38:02.550 --> 00:38:07.120
The more robust, not from a
technology perspective, but I mean

00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:10.160
from a very general perspective,
the product that I'm trying

00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:14.100
to develop will be and you
can cover your grounds,

00:38:14.100 --> 00:38:16.260
the better we are for the
future of accessibility.

00:38:16.260 --> 00:38:18.230
Because we want products
to be accessible.

00:38:18.230 --> 00:38:20.940
It's not only about
the minimum compliance.

00:38:20.940 --> 00:38:27.370
<v Danielle> Do you ever tell
a product website, whatever,

00:38:28.580 --> 00:38:30.450
"Wow, this is not good.

00:38:30.450 --> 00:38:33.260
You really need to start
over," versus, "Fix stuff"?

00:38:33.260 --> 00:38:36.781
Is there a level where you're
like, "Alert, stop.

00:38:37.782 --> 00:38:38.540
Rethink"?

00:38:38.540 --> 00:38:40.830
<v Tamar> Yes.

00:38:40.830 --> 00:38:41.750
Here's what's interesting.

00:38:41.750 --> 00:38:44.850
If I split the world of digital
products into three right now,

00:38:44.850 --> 00:38:47.400
and there's a lot more, but let's
just take three different cases.

00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:51.350
You have mobile, you have web
applications, and you have websites

00:38:51.350 --> 00:38:53.960
that are more static,
they have maybe some functionality,

00:38:53.960 --> 00:38:55.310
but not very complex.

00:38:55.310 --> 00:38:58.700
With web applications,
I'm speaking of more complex sites,

00:38:58.700 --> 00:39:01.550
e-commerce and whatnot.

00:39:01.550 --> 00:39:05.680
When the cost exceeds- you
want to do something, but

00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:08.470
when your cost is going
to exceed the benefit,

00:39:08.470 --> 00:39:12.320
in that you're testing, testing,
testing, but you're not really going

00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:15.970
to see the return on that,
you might as well start over

00:39:15.970 --> 00:39:18.090
because it's going to cost
you less in the long run.

00:39:19.370 --> 00:39:20.420
That's for websites.

00:39:20.420 --> 00:39:22.530
For clients that are
developing web applications,

00:39:22.530 --> 00:39:30.340
more complex e-commerce sites or
any dashboards or applications

00:39:30.340 --> 00:39:33.410
that you're using,
there's a lot of functions in it,

00:39:33.410 --> 00:39:35.590
you can generally fix.

00:39:37.100 --> 00:39:41.240
It's why digital accessibility is
such a wonderful world to be in.

00:39:41.240 --> 00:39:45.600
Because unlike having to add a
ramp to a building or an elevator

00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:50.230
to fix, per se, for accessibility,
in the digital world,

00:39:50.230 --> 00:39:54.040
you can test it, especially if you
could do some automatic testing.

00:39:54.040 --> 00:39:56.650
You can invest some of the
time to fix the elements

00:39:56.650 --> 00:39:58.380
because of the way
technology today is built.

00:39:58.380 --> 00:39:59.460
That's what we've found.

00:39:59.460 --> 00:40:01.140
We haven't told any one
of our clients, you have

00:40:01.140 --> 00:40:06.330
to rebuild your entire
Salesforce application.

00:40:06.330 --> 00:40:09.634
Rather, let's find critical,
let's have a roadmap

00:40:09.635 --> 00:40:11.220
for what else you need.

00:40:11.220 --> 00:40:12.677
That's the answer, yes.

00:40:12.677 --> 00:40:14.312
<v Danielle> Yes, that makes sense.

00:40:15.370 --> 00:40:22.780
With that, how can a company be
sure that the automated tests--

00:40:22.780 --> 00:40:25.970
This is a question that was
submitted from somebody.

00:40:25.970 --> 00:40:29.190
How can we be sure that the
automated tests are doing

00:40:29.190 --> 00:40:30.140
what they claim to do?

00:40:30.140 --> 00:40:33.030
I guess, how do you
prove that trust factor?

00:40:33.030 --> 00:40:38.930
For instance, they say in Africa
there's almost no legal framework

00:40:38.930 --> 00:40:42.050
or reference that would
hold any body accountable.

00:40:43.730 --> 00:40:48.520
If they're spending money,
how do you prove that it works?

00:40:48.520 --> 00:40:49.280
I guess.

00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:51.120
How do you prove you're trustable?

00:40:52.720 --> 00:40:54.985
<v Tamar> It's such a great point

00:40:54.986 --> 00:40:57.260
because this is where
we're coming to.

00:40:57.260 --> 00:41:01.890
We have countries that are more
mature with their regulations

00:41:03.060 --> 00:41:08.050
but even so, the maturity
level of the regulation may be-

00:41:08.050 --> 00:41:11.640
or rather,
the regulation might be mature in

00:41:11.640 --> 00:41:15.110
that you have one implemented, but
the enforcement is not implemented

00:41:15.110 --> 00:41:16.550
and nobody's going to do it.

00:41:16.550 --> 00:41:18.630
Cost is a major issue.

00:41:18.630 --> 00:41:21.620
There has to be an element
of a change of behavior,

00:41:21.620 --> 00:41:25.140
which is much, much,
much harder to implement.

00:41:25.140 --> 00:41:29.740
I would start somewhere by some
example, and not trying to reach

00:41:29.740 --> 00:41:33.850
that perfection level because there
is no such thing in accessibility.

00:41:33.850 --> 00:41:36.850
Rather, try to hit the
more critical barriers

00:41:36.850 --> 00:41:38.600
and just work the way through.

00:41:38.600 --> 00:41:43.470
I also know that in Africa
there are many, many initiatives

00:41:43.470 --> 00:41:47.960
to create or to implement
regulation and to try to implement

00:41:47.960 --> 00:41:50.780
some sort of enforcement,
but there's even more of an effort

00:41:50.780 --> 00:41:54.130
that tries to implement the change
of behavior and the understanding

00:41:54.130 --> 00:41:58.180
that if it's inaccessible,
it's just like creating a site

00:41:58.180 --> 00:41:59.790
that's not usable.

00:41:59.790 --> 00:42:02.810
<v Danielle> Right, and if you're
using a tool that is coming back

00:42:02.810 --> 00:42:06.324
and saying, "You're all good,"
odds are it's probably not right.

00:42:06.324 --> 00:42:06.890
[chuckles]

00:42:06.890 --> 00:42:07.750
<v Tamar> Right.

00:42:07.750 --> 00:42:10.110
Coming back to how do you know
that the automated tests are doing

00:42:10.110 --> 00:42:11.750
what they need to do, first of
all, you need to make sure

00:42:11.750 --> 00:42:13.540
that the automated
tests are interacting.

00:42:13.540 --> 00:42:15.500
Which I know is a long
shot, and I'm coming

00:42:15.500 --> 00:42:18.940
and I'm tooting my own horn,
because we don't have such a thing.

00:42:18.940 --> 00:42:20.440
We're creating it.

00:42:20.440 --> 00:42:24.240
There's no automated test that
can do what you need to do

00:42:24.240 --> 00:42:25.730
in order to interact it.

00:42:25.730 --> 00:42:28.830
Happy to show you what SenseIT
does, but I understand your point.

00:42:28.830 --> 00:42:31.950
Automated tests are going to cover
something, not the heavy lift.

00:42:31.950 --> 00:42:32.660
<v Danielle> Yes.

00:42:32.660 --> 00:42:36.400
There is a question here about
if you have a demo of it.

00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:40.310
We have about six or
seven minutes left.

00:42:40.310 --> 00:42:42.800
I don't know if you have
a link that they can go to

00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:47.300
or a place that they can see or
something, just to see a little bit

00:42:47.300 --> 00:42:52.270
in the example,
see what you're talking about.

00:42:52.270 --> 00:42:55.130
<v Tamar> Yes, I'm happy to do
it offline so that we don't have

00:42:55.130 --> 00:42:57.600
to go into the demo and the
servers and the everything

00:42:57.600 --> 00:42:59.800
because it is techy.

00:42:59.800 --> 00:43:00.930
We do have a demo.

00:43:00.930 --> 00:43:04.950
It's not yet available publicly,
which is very exciting for 2023.

00:43:04.950 --> 00:43:08.500
I take everybody's suggestions,
what would somebody want to see.

00:43:08.500 --> 00:43:12.010
Is it a video, or schedule
with us a call to see the demo

00:43:12.010 --> 00:43:13.210
and really have an explanation.

00:43:15.150 --> 00:43:19.170
Like a lot of founders,
we're still in that stage

00:43:19.170 --> 00:43:22.850
where the product is not
yet demo-able publicly.

00:43:22.850 --> 00:43:26.640
I'm happy to do it on
the side and show and go

00:43:26.640 --> 00:43:30.620
through all the screens and what it
does because really [crosstalk]--

00:43:30.620 --> 00:43:33.411
<v Danielle> Look
you up and find you.

00:43:33.411 --> 00:43:34.890
<v Tamar> I can send you a URL.

00:43:34.890 --> 00:43:37.990
To do a video now, it's a little
bit useless because you need

00:43:37.990 --> 00:43:41.540
to really understand it more
techy, but it's a good point.

00:43:42.596 --> 00:43:44.029
<v Danielle> I'm a developer.

00:43:44.030 --> 00:43:48.160
I've never really
written automated tests.

00:43:48.160 --> 00:43:51.440
Is this a tool that I
would be able to use?

00:43:51.440 --> 00:43:55.370
Because I have browser extensions,
I have stuff that I can manually do,

00:43:55.370 --> 00:43:58.690
and I understand it,
develop with accessibility.

00:43:58.690 --> 00:44:02.640
Is this something that I have
to know how to-- Do I have

00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:05.230
to be familiar with
automated testing?

00:44:05.230 --> 00:44:10.220
If so, is that something
that you offer to help with?

00:44:10.220 --> 00:44:13.730
<v Tamar> It's something that
we are toying with at the moment

00:44:13.730 --> 00:44:17.200
because what we've found is that
you do need to have automated tests

00:44:17.200 --> 00:44:19.180
in place for this to be effective.

00:44:19.180 --> 00:44:25.500
Yet, we have a whole group of
people like yourself, developers,

00:44:25.500 --> 00:44:31.030
that are either not self--
I keep missing the words.

00:44:32.090 --> 00:44:36.510
Not self-employed, but they're not
working within large organizations,

00:44:36.510 --> 00:44:38.967
or they do and they're
not necessarily connected

00:44:38.968 --> 00:44:42.420
to specific frameworks and
whatnot and how can we allow this.

00:44:42.420 --> 00:44:44.190
The answer is our partnerships.

00:44:44.190 --> 00:44:47.130
We're now looking into partnerships
with those same organizations

00:44:47.130 --> 00:44:49.740
that may offer, like,
I don't know if you're familiar

00:44:49.740 --> 00:44:54.920
with Selenium IDE, but certain tools
where you can actually create tests

00:44:54.920 --> 00:44:59.250
that are pretty simple that
then can be run through SenseIT.

00:44:59.250 --> 00:45:02.220
At this point,
the way that the product is built,

00:45:02.220 --> 00:45:04.140
you can't do something
without test automation

00:45:04.140 --> 00:45:06.130
because it's the way it works best.

00:45:06.130 --> 00:45:12.700
We are looking for what can
we have as a minimum trial

00:45:12.700 --> 00:45:16.510
where you don't necessarily need
to have the scripts in place,

00:45:16.510 --> 00:45:20.400
it may not be as effective, but it
is something that you could use.

00:45:20.400 --> 00:45:24.210
<v Danielle> Yes, or a library
of resources that here's

00:45:24.210 --> 00:45:27.010
how you learn about automated
testing, and then you can come to us.

00:45:27.010 --> 00:45:33.120
Because I would love to learn
it, but it's busy, clients.

00:45:33.120 --> 00:45:36.110
If I have to go and dive into
the world of the internet

00:45:36.110 --> 00:45:39.530
and try to figure it out,
I'll just eat the button myself.

00:45:39.530 --> 00:45:40.390
<v Tamar> Of course.

00:45:40.390 --> 00:45:45.530
Danielle, your point is so, so,
so on point because as a startup,

00:45:45.530 --> 00:45:46.410
you need to focus.

00:45:46.410 --> 00:45:48.350
Where are we going,
and what's the target audience?

00:45:48.350 --> 00:45:50.380
We'd like to hit everyone.

00:45:50.380 --> 00:45:53.560
What we've focused on is making
sure that the accessibility,

00:45:53.560 --> 00:45:57.790
the level of accessibility and
trust, just like someone asked, is

00:45:57.790 --> 00:45:59.400
at the highest caliber.

00:45:59.400 --> 00:46:02.810
We're always taking feedback because
I think that we have a lot of,

00:46:02.810 --> 00:46:05.310
and excuse my term,
but snake oil out there,

00:46:05.310 --> 00:46:09.170
and it's taken us enough
time to research and develop

00:46:09.170 --> 00:46:11.758
and come out with something
that really speaks

00:46:11.759 --> 00:46:13.300
to the accessibility world.

00:46:13.300 --> 00:46:16.260
Like you said, if it's not
simple, it can't be integrated

00:46:16.260 --> 00:46:19.240
or it can't be something that
a company is going to adopt,

00:46:19.240 --> 00:46:21.360
we've focused on that as well.

00:46:21.360 --> 00:46:25.280
Then we have developers like yourself
that we're developing websites

00:46:25.280 --> 00:46:27.730
and we're working,
but we don't do test automation.

00:46:27.730 --> 00:46:32.880
It's still a question that we're
trying to answer with ourselves,

00:46:32.880 --> 00:46:38.600
what is the future of a SenseIT
for the mainstream developers?

00:46:38.600 --> 00:46:44.060
<v Danielle> We have a final
clarifying question, I think.

00:46:44.060 --> 00:46:45.690
We do have like three minutes.

00:46:46.960 --> 00:46:50.430
Sally says, are you saying that
you can implement manual testing

00:46:50.430 --> 00:46:52.220
into automated testing?

00:46:52.220 --> 00:46:55.080
I think that it's more side by
side, right?

00:46:55.080 --> 00:46:56.590
You're doing two at once.

00:46:57.415 --> 00:47:00.910
<v Tamar> Well, we are simulating
the way that a user uses.

00:47:00.910 --> 00:47:04.000
There are certain manual tests
like keyboard navigation.

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:05.070
That's a manual test.

00:47:05.070 --> 00:47:06.688
You can't test for
keyboard navigation

00:47:06.689 --> 00:47:08.880
without manually navigating
through a product.

00:47:08.880 --> 00:47:14.160
SenseIT now can navigate through the
product, following a specific script.

00:47:14.160 --> 00:47:16.770
In other words,
it would follow through a process.

00:47:16.770 --> 00:47:19.040
Does it cover all the
grounds of a manual tester?

00:47:19.040 --> 00:47:20.760
Are we coming to
replace a manual tester?

00:47:20.760 --> 00:47:21.570
Absolutely not.

00:47:21.570 --> 00:47:25.840
Are we allowing organizations to
leverage what they already have,

00:47:25.840 --> 00:47:29.110
test what they're testing,
but now for accessibility,

00:47:29.110 --> 00:47:33.810
which means they're covering what is
being covered in mainstream testing

00:47:33.810 --> 00:47:35.700
and now they can do
for accessibility?

00:47:35.700 --> 00:47:41.510
Yes, with an asterisk that those
same organizations generally

00:47:41.510 --> 00:47:45.360
have accessibility teams implemented,
and they have their own policies

00:47:45.360 --> 00:47:49.130
and know what else needs to be
tested manually and whatnot.

00:47:49.130 --> 00:47:52.280
We are offering here heavy lifting,
but by no means am I coming

00:47:52.280 --> 00:47:55.080
and saying we replace,
rather we're supporting.

00:47:55.080 --> 00:47:56.500
I hope that helps.

00:47:56.500 --> 00:48:00.780
We do have an element of editing
within the platform so that

00:48:00.780 --> 00:48:03.840
if you're running manual tests,
you could add those tests

00:48:03.840 --> 00:48:07.280
or those results within the
reports that we generate.

00:48:07.280 --> 00:48:08.150
I hope that answers it.

00:48:08.150 --> 00:48:12.690
<v Danielle> Yes, I think that
clarifies it for me, at least.

00:48:12.690 --> 00:48:14.620
I think it sounds really awesome.

00:48:14.620 --> 00:48:18.020
I love the idea of
automated testing.

00:48:18.020 --> 00:48:21.170
I don't know anything about
it, but it sounds really cool.

00:48:21.170 --> 00:48:27.210
I love the marrying of this
really important situation

00:48:27.210 --> 00:48:33.000
that should be part of the spine
of the internet that is now

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:35.570
being implemented in this
way, so I love it.

00:48:35.570 --> 00:48:37.620
<v Tamar> Yes,
I love the way you said that,

00:48:37.620 --> 00:48:40.030
the spine of the internet,
absolutely [inaudible]

00:48:40.030 --> 00:48:40.490
[sound cut]

00:48:40.490 --> 00:48:41.420
completely.

00:48:41.420 --> 00:48:43.250
Thank you so much for your time.

00:48:43.250 --> 00:48:46.170
For everyone, anyone that does
want to reach out and see a demo,

00:48:46.170 --> 00:48:48.610
not a sales demo, really just
to understand the product

00:48:48.610 --> 00:48:50.450
and give feedback, by all means.

00:48:50.450 --> 00:48:53.420
I don't know if we have my email
here, but I'm happy to speak

00:48:53.420 --> 00:48:55.032
to anyone and everyone.

00:48:55.032 --> 00:48:58.164
<v Danielle> Yes,
I think if you're on the--

00:48:58.803 --> 00:48:59.510
<v Tamar> I am on the chat.

00:49:00.521 --> 00:49:04.140
<v Danielle> You're on the chat,
and then you have your speaker page

00:49:04.140 --> 00:49:07.878
on site,
so they'll be able to find you.

00:49:07.878 --> 00:49:08.879
<v Tamar> Wonderful.

00:49:10.481 --> 00:49:11.290
<v Danielle> That's awesome.

00:49:11.290 --> 00:49:12.930
Thank you so much again.

00:49:12.930 --> 00:49:17.590
Thank you for attending this
session with Tamar Schapira.

00:49:17.590 --> 00:49:20.820
You can continue the conversation,
like we said, in the chat,

00:49:20.820 --> 00:49:31.902
or on social media using
#WPA11yDay and #WPAD2022.

00:49:31.902 --> 00:49:36.250
We also appreciate it if you go
to wpaccessibility.day/feedback

00:49:38.090 --> 00:49:42.280
to provide anonymous feedback for
our speakers on their presentations.

00:49:43.550 --> 00:49:48.920
We'd also like to take a quick moment
to thank our platinum sponsors,

00:49:48.920 --> 00:49:54.340
