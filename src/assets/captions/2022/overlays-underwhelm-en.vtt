WEBVTT

00:00:00.007 --> 00:00:32.266
[silence]

00:00:32.266 --> 00:00:35.400
<v Carrie Dils> Welcome to
WordPress Accessibility Day.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.820
My name is Carrie Dils and I'm
a freelance WordPress developer

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.920
and instructor,
and I appreciate you joining me

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:47.460
for this session Overlays
Underwhelm with Adrian Roselli.

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.570
Adrian has written articles
for trade journals, websites,

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:54.750
and participated as an author
and editor on five books.

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.800
In 1998, he co-founded a software
development consulting firm

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.910
before leading at
the start of 2016.

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.580
He was a member of the W3C
Web Platform Working Group.

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:15.370
W3C ARIA Working Group,
and W3C Accessibility Task Force.

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:19.910
Some may recognize Adrian from
his days helping to run evolt.org,

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:22.650
one of the first communities
for web developers.

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.920
Adrian has been developing
for the Web since 1993.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:27.900
That is so awesome.

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.460
I'm excited to have you, Adrian.

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.520
If anybody has questions, feel
free to drop those in the Q&A tab

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:39.730
of Slido and you can use that idea
section to chat with other attendees.

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:40.330
Welcome, Adrian.

00:01:41.702 --> 00:01:43.450
<v Adrian Roselli> Hi, there.

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:44.538
Thanks for having me.

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.720
I guess I just started going.

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.620
All right, cool.

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:54.010
The title of this talk
is Overlays Underwhelm.

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:57.820
I had the title, but before I
had the content, so I'm trying

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.990
to shoehorn this over under-theme
into the talk throughout.

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.860
Thanks to the magic of one-way
audio, I will not hear your grunts

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:06.860
of disapproval.

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:09.330
This is a good thing.

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.800
I include this ego slide to
give you the barest indication

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.780
that I have some experience, you
already heard a bunch of this though.

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.490
I want my arguments
to stand on the merit,

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:22.240
but I understand you want to know
my chops, so business books, sites,

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:23.390
articles, et cetera.

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.630
You can look me up to confirm
all of this stuff of course.

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.530
Now into the meat of the
talk, we should consider

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.290
what gaps accessibility
overlays are filling.

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.000
The web has lots of accessibility
bits built in already.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.810
There are more tools and
features available to developers

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.450
and users than ever before.

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:48.660
After all, as Tim Berners-Lee said,
"The B4520 gets you there faster

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.450
and bypasses that nasty
roundabout outside Swindon."

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:54.650
I also may have that quote wrong.

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.040
Let's first ask,
what is an overlay?

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.270
An overlay is a tool that
provides some accessibility

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:07.590
or usability feature that may not
be built into the underlying site.

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.460
Sometimes it replicates native
features and sometimes it offers

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:12.270
some other affordance.

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:15.150
Often does the work in the
end-user's browser relying

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.480
on each user's computer
to replicate the same work

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.870
as every other user's computer.

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.240
They can also be referred to as
widgets, toolbars, or add-ons.

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:27.410
There were many tools that
predated native features

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:30.000
or that were created to
fill gaps in technology,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.070
including assistive technology.

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:34.990
Some techniques and standards
may not have been defined

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:38.590
or even well-supported when
these tools were created.

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.700
The risk is that these tools
required users to learn them anew

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:45.710
for every site with features that
would not carry across sites.

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.740
This might be loud, I'm hoping not.

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:54.060
BrowseAloud is an early example.

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.090
It converts the text
on a page to speech.

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:01.708
AI: Change Region, Product,
For Education, Read&Write,

00:04:02.309 --> 00:04:10.940
EquatIO, Speechstream, WriQ,
Fluency Tutor, OrbitNote.

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:13.186
For Work, Read&Write.

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:18.200
<v Adrian> This as you can
see or hear offers no context

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:20.350
for what is being
read, visible or not.

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:23.580
It was never meant to
replicate screen readers.

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:26.930
Instead, it's akin to a feature you
can find built into browsers today,

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:29.550
such as Edge's Immersive Reader.

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:32.130
BrowserAloud requires a
third-party embedded script,

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:35.920
and back in 2018 was briefly
hacked to mine cryptocurrencies.

00:04:37.572 --> 00:04:40.246
Some widgets made an effort
to replicate features already

00:04:40.247 --> 00:04:42.110
in browsers
and operating systems.

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:45.660
These ranged from text sizing
to contrast and lightness,

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.980
to motion control and even
zooming and magnification.

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:53.220
This text sizing widget
shows how they can go wrong,

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:55.610
is no longer available on the site.

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:57.820
Assuming you could find
it behind a gear icon,

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:01.060
the control only appeared when
you were at the top of the page.

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:04.310
The widget only resized
article content, not headlines,

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:06.630
not navigation, nothing else.

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:09.220
Since that article content
was outside the viewport,

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:13.050
it also made it near impossible
to compare sizing options.

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:15.680
It does not retain the size
as you navigate the site

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:19.460
and when you return to the site
or even for the print styles.

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:22.520
Better implementations have shown
users how to change their browser

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:25.030
or operating systems instead.

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:28.020
However, this could be a useful
stop-gap feature to gauge

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:32.080
if users regularly scale text
and perhaps adjust those defaults

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:33.460
on your site as a result.

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:38.740
Some widgets exist because
there is no native equivalent

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:43.260
or the needs are not well
represented in what exists.

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.150
Success for those widgets comes
down to how well they perform.

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:49.760
Hand Talk is another add-on.

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:53.770
It will load an animated avatar
to sign the content of a page,

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:56.880
like the text-to-speech example
earlier, it presents the content

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:59.050
of the page in sign language.

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:01.061
It still cannot offer
the same context

00:06:01.062 --> 00:06:02.660
for what content is associated

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:06.690
with what other content, so the
user may need to also read along.

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:11.070
I did not explore how many
sign languages it supports.

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:13.328
To its credit,
it is not finger-spelling everything

00:06:13.329 --> 00:06:17.050
it encounters, but I leave it to
the audience to judge its value.

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:21.614
The current list of
overlay vendors is

00:06:21.615 --> 00:06:23.140
not necessarily filling these gaps,

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:26.870
however, they are capitalizing on
a general lack of understanding

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:30.060
of people and needs,
focusing on selling quick fixes

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:31.960
to businesses instead.

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:37.250
These companies include AccessiBe,
AccessiWay, Adally, AudioEye,

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:43.450
redacted, FACIL'iti, MaxAccess,
Poloda AI, Purple Lens, redacted,

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:44.860
and UserWay.

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:47.520
There are also vendors that
white-label some of these products.

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:52.090
Overlays tend to
overstate their abilities.

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:54.860
In technical reviews,
they consistently underperform.

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:59.470
Automated accessibility
testing tools are not perfect,

00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:01.140
but we can use them
to get a sense of

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:05.490
whether or not an overlay has
improved WCAG compliance of the page.

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:08.560
I used an automated checker to
compare the number of errors before

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:11.120
and after an overlay was activated.

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:14.600
The page had more detectable
WCAG errors after.

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:16.870
The examples that follow
are about a year old.

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:19.520
I opted not to retest
because I have no interest

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:21.510
in providing free testing.

00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:24.970
Besides, these vendors were claiming
WCAG compliance when I tested.

00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:28.470
If they were lying then, there's no
reason to assume they would stop now.

00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:34.410
Deque's Axe browser plugin prides
itself on no false positives.

00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:38.120
As a result, it may be more lenient
than a human tester would be.

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:41.230
After running an overlay on the
vendor's own page, the number

00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:45.750
of detectable errors identified
by Axe tripled, from 4 to 12.

00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:51.410
TPGI's ARC toolkit plugin is
less likely to be lenient.

00:07:51.410 --> 00:07:55.050
When testing the same page, the
number of detectable errors doubled,

00:07:55.050 --> 00:07:58.060
jumping from 19 to 38 when
the overlay was activated.

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:04.330
ARC also jumped from
164 warnings to 193.

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:06.680
These do not represent
clear WCAG violations,

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:08.900
but instead warrant some
form of manual testing.

00:08:10.590 --> 00:08:13.870
WebAIM's WAVE checker browser
plugin returned no violations

00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:15.820
without the overlay active.

00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:19.370
After the overlay was activated,
a single contrast violation appeared.

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:23.290
I've written about my concerns
at AccessiBe was spoofing WAVE,

00:08:23.290 --> 00:08:26.630
though I cannot wade into
that code to confirm this.

00:08:26.630 --> 00:08:31.580
WAVE used to display a message, "The
third party AccessiBe integration

00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:36.290
on this page may temporarily modify
content when WAVE is activated,

00:08:36.290 --> 00:08:38.380
resulting in interference
with WAVE detection

00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:42.110
of/and accuracy identifying
accessibility and compliance issues."

00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:49.070
We know that automated accessibility
testing tools only identify

00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:51.320
about 30% of issues.

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:53.950
That number shifts based on
complexity and other factors.

00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:57.130
That 30% number
acknowledges that much

00:08:57.130 --> 00:09:01.270
of WCAG requires human
judgment based on context.

00:09:01.270 --> 00:09:04.920
Overlay vendors claim they
can address the other 70%.

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:06.590
That is a bold claim.

00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:08.150
It is also easy to disprove.

00:09:10.210 --> 00:09:12.900
The stop animations button
on this overlay fails

00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:15.640
to stop the auto-playing
background video.

00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:19.290
To compound the confusion, the button
changes only its accessible name

00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:21.500
when pressed,
it does not use aria-press

00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:22.970
to indicate it has been activated.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.420
That brief flash you saw was simply
from the YouTube video looping.

00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:33.490
I tried the keyboard navigation
feature of one vendor

00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:38.820
since its unaddressed navigation
violates 1.4.13 content on hover

00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:41.910
and 2.4.7 focus visible.

00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:45.880
Even after I activate the feature,
focus styles are still missing.

00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:49.280
Eventually, a new box
appears with different links.

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:50.580
I was tapping so much already.

00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:54.170
I tapped past the item that
displayed the instructions.

00:09:54.170 --> 00:09:58.000
To drive home the point, it drops
me into a de facto keyboard trap

00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.000
and it's cookie popup.

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:05.450
It's not just the claimed
fixes that do not work.

00:10:05.450 --> 00:10:08.370
The tools themselves
present barriers.

00:10:08.370 --> 00:10:11.370
The button in the background
video is one example.

00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:14.370
In other cases, screen reader
users have noted they hear sounds

00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:16.690
from the overlay with no
explanation what they mean.

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:20.100
The tools don't even
prevent their own customer

00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:21.980
from making new WCAG violations.

00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:25.159
Here, the overlay is very tall,

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:27.600
so this image captures
four screen fulls.

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:31.900
It shows how the contrast of the
controls is so light, it is hard

00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:35.850
to determine if one is active
or at what degree it is active.

00:10:35.850 --> 00:10:38.890
Some of the text and
icons are illegible.

00:10:38.890 --> 00:10:42.320
The language selector, which
commits the internationalization sin

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:46.030
of using flags to choose language,
provides no alt attributes

00:10:46.030 --> 00:10:47.680
for those flags.

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:51.360
The overlay violates at least
three WCAG success criteria

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:53.140
from just a few
seconds of examination.

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:56.850
Part of this is because
the configuration options

00:10:56.850 --> 00:10:59.410
for the overlay customer
do not prevent them

00:10:59.410 --> 00:11:02.890
from choosing colors that
clearly fail contrast checks.

00:11:02.890 --> 00:11:06.040
Here, the white text on the pink
white background has a contrast ratio

00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:07.870
of 1.2 to 1.

00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:10.630
The overlay vendor allowed
its customer to do this.

00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:17.410
Here, we can see that the browser's
default focus ring is active,

00:11:17.410 --> 00:11:19.390
but then the browser
alert prompting the user

00:11:19.390 --> 00:11:21.950
to activate the overlay appears.

00:11:21.950 --> 00:11:25.590
If the user declines,
that focus ring is somehow removed.

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:30.790
The only clue that focus is changing
is in the browser status bar

00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:33.310
or when the page eventually
jumps to scroll down.

00:11:37.010 --> 00:11:40.840
Here, I navigate an overlay vendor
site and as the new page was loading,

00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:43.490
it grazed itself as if
a model will appear,

00:11:43.490 --> 00:11:45.700
and then some hidden
audio starts playing.

00:11:47.207 --> 00:11:47.960
<v Ronnie> Hi.

00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:51.990
I'm Ronnie from AccessiBe,
the number one fully automated ADA

00:11:51.990 --> 00:11:54.060
and WCAG compliance solution.

00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:58.150
In this video, we'll learn how
AccessiBe AI-powered technology takes

00:11:58.150 --> 00:12:02.910
any website accessible and compliance
with the WCAG 2.1, the ADA.

00:12:03.723 --> 00:12:07.770
<v Adrian> You could see potentially
that I clicked on the gray

00:12:07.770 --> 00:12:11.270
in the hopes that maybe a hidden
video model would disappear.

00:12:11.270 --> 00:12:14.150
I scrolled around the page
looking for player controls.

00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:16.640
I also hit the escape
key with no look.

00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:21.100
The page itself is a good example
of a 1.4.2 audio control violation

00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:25.530
and 1.2.1 audio-only and
video-only prerecorded violation.

00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:31.070
Here is an overlay button trigger
with an icon of a paper boat

00:12:31.070 --> 00:12:35.720
or a hat and the visible text,
customized accessibility,

00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:39.620
the browser dev tools
indicated has focus, but thanks

00:12:39.620 --> 00:12:44.260
to an outline, non-important,
there's no visible style.

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:47.133
That's a 2.4.7 focus
visible failure.

00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:53.340
The boat icon image has alt text.

00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:55.730
The alt text does not
describe the image,

00:12:55.730 --> 00:12:59.280
instead it reads manage
display settings.

00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:02.590
That feels like a 1.1.1
non-text content failure to me.

00:13:03.780 --> 00:13:05.910
That makes the full
accessible name of the button

00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:09.820
"Manage display settings
Customized Accessibility",

00:13:11.324 --> 00:13:13.029
but the button has an ARIA label,

00:13:13.029 --> 00:13:15.995
reading FACIL'iti
colon adapt display,

00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:20.880
which overrides the text we can
see, which is a 2.5.3 label

00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:21.880
and name failure.

00:13:22.730 --> 00:13:24.980
That's three WCAG
failures on the button

00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:28.620
that triggers the accessibility
features from the overlay vendor.

00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:33.810
The following examples
are from AccessiBe.

00:13:33.810 --> 00:13:37.110
The reason AccessiBe is more
prominent in my tweets and posts is

00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:39.960
because it seems to be the loudest
at using its venture funding

00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:41.870
to promote its product.

00:13:41.870 --> 00:13:44.090
It took a year for AccessiBe
to update the terms

00:13:44.090 --> 00:13:46.350
on its site after I flagged these.

00:13:46.350 --> 00:13:48.690
I have no idea what terms are
written into their contracts,

00:13:49.910 --> 00:13:53.900
certainly not now, and those
contracts may retain this language.

00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:56.390
Other vendors have made
similar compliance promises

00:13:56.390 --> 00:13:59.510
and may have similarly mooted
those promises in their terms.

00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:05.570
From the AccessiBe homepage, does
AccessiBe protect me from lawsuits?

00:14:05.570 --> 00:14:06.420
Absolutely.

00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:09.130
AccessiBe turns inaccessible
websites into WICAG

00:14:09.130 --> 00:14:13.470
and ADA-compliant websites, but not
only that, AccessiBe provides you

00:14:13.470 --> 00:14:15.880
with a litigation support
package in case you need

00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:19.550
to prove your ADA website compliance
and guides you through the process.

00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:23.970
Another one from the
homepage, does AccessiBe cover

00:14:23.970 --> 00:14:26.200
all accessibility requirements?

00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:28.880
Yes, exclamation mark.

00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:32.860
AccessiBe covers the WCAG,
Web Content Accessibility Guidelines,

00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:37.940
version 2.1 at the AA level success
criteria and in certain areas,

00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:39.760
even level AAA.

00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:42.260
This is a step beyond
what legislation requires,

00:14:44.770 --> 00:14:46.860
but that is different
from the AccessiBe terms

00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:51.340
and conditions page here
captured from December 2020.

00:14:51.340 --> 00:14:54.790
In this section, AccessiBe is
defining the word "standard"

00:14:54.790 --> 00:14:59.640
to mean specifically "WCAG 2.1
level AA success criteria".

00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:05.360
From the AccessiBe
terms, "The functionality

00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:08.220
of the AccessiBe systems requires
that the licensee website

00:15:08.220 --> 00:15:13.050
in which they are embedded the
websites based solely on HTML files

00:15:13.050 --> 00:15:16.860
and tags, and that the source
code be written according

00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:21.460
to the standard of the World
Wide Web Consortium, W3C,

00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:24.540
without any errors
or validation warning

00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:26.980
in W3C's troubleshooting
inspections.

00:15:28.090 --> 00:15:30.790
Please note that licensee
changes to such website

00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:33.850
may impact the functionality
of the service.

00:15:33.850 --> 00:15:38.000
By way of example, AccessiBe systems
do not support other components

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.120
such as Canvas, Flash, and/or SVG."

00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:46.680
Essentially, AccessiBe states
that its customer websites

00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:50.770
must already meet the
standard, which we confirmed is

00:15:50.770 --> 00:15:56.520
defined as WCAG 2.1 AA with no errors
or even warnings from the validator.

00:15:58.220 --> 00:16:01.640
Again, essentially your site
must be WCAG compliant to conform

00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:05.380
to AccessiBe's terms for
a product guaranteeing

00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:06.910
to make your site WCAG-compliant.

00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:11.550
AccessiBe then goes on to
exempt PDFs, Flash, SVG files,

00:16:11.550 --> 00:16:16.090
and even any mobile devices not
running Android 8 or iOS 10.

00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:22.430
To remind you that AccessiBe is not
the only one making these claims,

00:16:22.430 --> 00:16:24.310
here is UserWay site.

00:16:24.310 --> 00:16:28.450
It says it will make your site
ADA-compliant, which is not a thing.

00:16:28.450 --> 00:16:31.380
It brags about the lack
of lawsuits mentioning it.

00:16:31.380 --> 00:16:35.010
It claims to have a strong reputation
in the disability community.

00:16:35.010 --> 00:16:38.480
It asserts its privacy chops
and it claims it is secured

00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:40.410
by not tracking people
with disabilities.

00:16:42.670 --> 00:16:44.750
I do not have a Lexus
Nexus subscription

00:16:44.750 --> 00:16:47.670
to confirm UserWay's
claim about lawsuits,

00:16:47.670 --> 00:16:50.070
but I know Yieldstreet
was unable to use UserWay

00:16:50.070 --> 00:16:51.820
to get its lawsuit dismissed.

00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:57.170
However, I can say that many lawsuits
do not name the overlay vendor.

00:16:57.170 --> 00:16:59.500
Many of these vendors claim
they can protect their customers

00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:00.820
from lawsuits.

00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:02.989
AccessiBe's CEO has even written

00:17:02.989 --> 00:17:06.570
"Never not once had
encountered a company

00:17:06.570 --> 00:17:11.330
that got sued because of
AccessiBe." Yet in 2020,

00:17:11.330 --> 00:17:15.840
over 250 companies were sued
after investing in overlays.

00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:19.650
The lawsuit pace picked up to almost
one per day by the end of the year.

00:17:21.610 --> 00:17:23.010
Here are just five examples.

00:17:23.010 --> 00:17:25.840
At least one of which
mentioned the vendor by name.

00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:29.040
Four of them mentioned AccessiBe
despite its CEO's claims.

00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:34.230
They are Kolesar v.
ByIt, LLC, Thomas Klaus

00:17:34.230 --> 00:17:37.550
and Robert Jahoda v.
Upright Technologies, Blair

00:17:37.550 --> 00:17:43.030
Douglas v. Masterbuilt Manufacturing,
LLC, Murphy v. Eyebobs, LLC,

00:17:44.370 --> 00:17:49.430
Fischler et al v. Dorai Homes,
and LightHouse et al v. ADP.

00:17:50.850 --> 00:17:55.650
The LightHouse-ADP case goes
further and explicitly states that

00:17:56.880 --> 00:18:00.250
"For the purpose of this
agreement, overlay solutions

00:18:00.250 --> 00:18:04.030
such as those currently provided
by companies such as AudioEye

00:18:04.030 --> 00:18:08.090
and AccessiBe will not suffice
to achieve accessibility."

00:18:11.810 --> 00:18:14.760
The Eyebobs case concluded in
a settlement where Eyebobs has

00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:17.800
to create an accessibility
team, perform an audit,

00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:21.930
adopt a policy statement,
implement an accessibility strategy

00:18:21.930 --> 00:18:24.420
and provide accessibility training.

00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:26.310
The overlay did not
protect Eyebobs.

00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:32.560
WIRED wrote an article titled This
Company Tapped AI for its Website

00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:33.560
and Landed in Court.

00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:36.870
I'm going to read a bit
from the article now.

00:18:38.230 --> 00:18:40.520
"In a statement,
AccessiBe's head of Marketing.

00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:44.620
Gil Magen, said the company
had analyzed Eyebobs' website

00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:47.610
and found it complied with
the accessibility standards.

00:18:47.610 --> 00:18:50.550
AccessiBe offers clients
assistance with litigations,

00:18:50.550 --> 00:18:53.310
but Eyebobs declined,
the statement said.

00:18:53.310 --> 00:18:56.440
In its own statement, Eyebobs
said AccessiBe failed to respond

00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:58.390
to request for meetings
with its lawyers.

00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:03.600
'Eyebobs is no longer working with
AccessiBe nor will we in the future."

00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:04.760
the statement said.

00:19:08.150 --> 00:19:10.990
Sometimes a company relies on
the overlay as its only way

00:19:10.990 --> 00:19:13.990
to become accessible to
customers, but what happens

00:19:13.990 --> 00:19:15.980
when the script will not load?

00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:17.630
Malwarebytes has blocked them.

00:19:17.630 --> 00:19:19.290
Ad blockers have blocked them.

00:19:19.290 --> 00:19:22.700
Firefox-enhanced privacy
protection blocks them.

00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:25.910
What if the script has an
error or the network chunks?

00:19:25.910 --> 00:19:27.670
Is your site "protected"?

00:19:29.030 --> 00:19:30.030
Are the users helped?

00:19:32.310 --> 00:19:34.610
This screenshot of
browser dev tools shows

00:19:34.610 --> 00:19:37.160
that the overlay
script has not loaded.

00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:40.180
Worse, that accessibility link
in the footer is just a div

00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:42.310
with a tab index and a button roll.

00:19:42.310 --> 00:19:43.820
It does nothing else when clicked

00:19:43.821 --> 00:19:45.650
because the overlay
script is supposed

00:19:45.650 --> 00:19:47.040
to replace it with a real control.

00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:52.430
On the Malwarebytes' forum,
a user wanted to know if the script

00:19:52.430 --> 00:19:55.240
from an overlay vendor
was a tracker or not.

00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:58.680
The Malwarebytes staff
acknowledged it had been blocked.

00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:02.800
Until the user asked the question,
Malwarebytes had blocked the overlay

00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:05.560
for all its customers
for potentially years.

00:20:11.290 --> 00:20:14.040
The claims of no privacy
risk are spurious at best.

00:20:15.060 --> 00:20:18.920
Data Protection Impact
Assessment or DPIA is a process

00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:23.290
to help you identify and minimize the
data protection risks of a project.

00:20:23.290 --> 00:20:26.480
You must do a DPIA for processing
information that is likely

00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:29.400
to result in a high
risk to individuals.

00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:31.460
The vendors do not provide one.

00:20:31.460 --> 00:20:36.010
As a result, any claimed GDPR
compliance is in question.

00:20:36.010 --> 00:20:38.950
Remember that these overlay
scripts must parse all the content

00:20:38.950 --> 00:20:41.440
on the page, essentially
reading what you are surfing.

00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:44.660
Some of them keep your
settings from site to site

00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:45.810
by setting tracking cookies.

00:20:47.430 --> 00:20:49.780
Here in a tweet,
Léonie Watson demonstrates

00:20:49.780 --> 00:20:52.380
how cavalierly overly vendors
treat this compliance.

00:20:53.710 --> 00:20:56.710
The tweet, "Hello, AccessiBe.

00:20:56.710 --> 00:20:59.140
I've asked you by DM
and by phone for a copy

00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:00.726
of your Data Protection
Impact Assessment

00:21:00.726 --> 00:21:02.580
and you have not responded.

00:21:02.580 --> 00:21:05.580
Since asking discreetly has not
worked, I am now asking openly

00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:09.780
for you to share your DPIA since
you claim GDPR conformance.

00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:10.780
Thank you."

00:21:11.710 --> 00:21:15.430
She asked on April 1st, 2021,
and is still not heard back

00:21:15.430 --> 00:21:16.740
and it has been more than a year.

00:21:17.850 --> 00:21:20.350
I'm not a lawyer,
but this might be a GDPR violation.

00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:27.080
The DSW site uses redacted
assistive overlay.

00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:29.520
Though instead of an
accessibility icon in the corner,

00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:33.325
it uses the text
"Enable Accessibility"

00:21:33.325 --> 00:21:36.499
in gray on gray
located in the header.

00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:39.560
If you block third-party cookies,
you get the following browser alert

00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:40.600
when you try to activate it.

00:21:41.790 --> 00:21:45.390
An embedded page at
A40.redacted.com says

00:21:45.390 --> 00:21:48.780
your web browser privacy settings
are preventing the accessibility mode

00:21:48.780 --> 00:21:50.510
to stay enabled.

00:21:50.510 --> 00:21:54.360
Try enabling third-party cookies to
ensure you receive accessible updates

00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:55.360
to the website.

00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:58.800
This presents a false
choice between security

00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:01.990
and what may be a more
accessible experience.

00:22:01.990 --> 00:22:04.750
Nowhere does the user have
the opportunity to understand

00:22:04.750 --> 00:22:07.290
how those third-party
cookies will be used,

00:22:07.290 --> 00:22:08.690
what information will be shared.

00:22:10.140 --> 00:22:13.660
Essentially, a user has to disclose
a disability or access need

00:22:13.660 --> 00:22:16.650
with no indication how that
information will persist.

00:22:17.730 --> 00:22:19.780
It is also a reminder that
these products don't make

00:22:19.780 --> 00:22:27.170
a site more accessible, instead
these products make your computer try

00:22:27.170 --> 00:22:28.540
to make a site less broken.

00:22:31.130 --> 00:22:34.155
In August 2022, the Federal
Trade Commission announced

00:22:34.155 --> 00:22:37.456
an advanced notice of proposed
rule-making for a rule

00:22:37.456 --> 00:22:39.990
on commercial surveillance
and data security.

00:22:40.940 --> 00:22:43.960
I left the comment specifically
about the non-HIPAA health data

00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:46.780
to which overlays have
access, along with my concern

00:22:46.780 --> 00:22:49.170
that they can sell
it to data brokers.

00:22:49.170 --> 00:22:54.850
Since 99.98% of Americans can be
identified from an anonymized dataset

00:22:54.850 --> 00:22:59.320
with only 15 data points,
this should be a genuine concern.

00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:01.580
I hope the FTC treats it as such.

00:23:04.610 --> 00:23:07.930
Overlay vendors will over-promise
in their marketing, making claims

00:23:07.930 --> 00:23:11.060
about their utility and popularity
while under-delivering on them.

00:23:12.330 --> 00:23:16.090
These vendors rely on a combination
of fear, uncertainty, and doubt.

00:23:16.090 --> 00:23:20.210
They know how many website owners do
not understand accessibility laws.

00:23:20.210 --> 00:23:22.660
Even as users complain about the
problems with these products,

00:23:22.660 --> 00:23:25.220
the vendors use astroturfing
techniques to drown it out.

00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:29.780
This is an advertisement for
one of the overlay vendors.

00:23:29.780 --> 00:23:32.320
It is a cartoon of a man at
computer happily exclaiming,

00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:34.290
"Finally, my website is up."

00:23:34.290 --> 00:23:37.320
Two men in suits suddenly appear
next to him holding legal papers

00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:38.810
and say, "Not so fast.

00:23:38.810 --> 00:23:40.800
Nice website,
but it's not accessible.

00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:42.480
You've been served."

00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:45.450
The website owner now crying,
hands up in the air says,

00:23:45.450 --> 00:23:47.550
"I'm broke now, why bother?"

00:23:47.550 --> 00:23:50.560
In the background, the two men can
be seen walking away carrying bags

00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:51.560
of money.

00:23:52.230 --> 00:23:55.760
Overlay vendors use fear of
lawsuits to sell their product,

00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:57.600
not a desire to help users.

00:23:57.600 --> 00:24:00.620
The cartoon is careful not to show
disabled people as the villains,

00:24:00.620 --> 00:24:02.440
but the implication is clear.

00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:05.550
The laws that protect disabled
people will cost you money

00:24:05.550 --> 00:24:06.960
unless you pay for
the vendor's help.

00:24:09.690 --> 00:24:14.050
One vendor cited that a
"silent majority" of users

00:24:14.050 --> 00:24:16.160
like the overlay product
and that as a result,

00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:19.960
the complaints that appear
online are only exceptions.

00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:20.580
Here are Chancey.

00:24:20.580 --> 00:24:21.790
Fleet tweets.

00:24:21.790 --> 00:24:24.790
"The founders of AccessiBe are
interpreting the complacency

00:24:24.790 --> 00:24:29.090
of non-disabled customers and the
bone-deep fatigue of disabled users

00:24:29.090 --> 00:24:33.510
to mean that a silent majority,
their actual words, is grateful for

00:24:33.510 --> 00:24:36.720
and enjoys AccessiBe.

00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:37.810
Let's not be silent then."

00:24:39.220 --> 00:24:42.730
That was in reply to a tweet
from Marco Salsiccia who says,

00:24:42.730 --> 00:24:45.420
"Pretty much, as well as citing
their silent majority of blind users

00:24:45.420 --> 00:24:49.670
who approve and test their
product, I ran into so many issues

00:24:49.670 --> 00:24:51.960
just going through their
example sites alone.

00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:53.940
I didn't want to give
them a fully free audit

00:24:53.940 --> 00:24:55.370
of how much they were doing wrong."

00:24:57.840 --> 00:25:01.100
In addition, these vendors have a
history of astroturfing review sites,

00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:03.870
social media and
the web In general.

00:25:03.870 --> 00:25:07.910
The effort is to ensure
only their message appears,

00:25:07.910 --> 00:25:11.050
and they have the money SEO chops
and lack of integrity to do it.

00:25:12.180 --> 00:25:14.400
I have links to Twitter
spam, medium articles,

00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:17.600
paid promotion pieces and industry
sites, questionable reviews

00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:20.640
on other platforms, even Wikipedia
entries that were flagged

00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:23.110
by the moderators as spam.

00:25:23.110 --> 00:25:25.460
The image here shows a
headline from WP Tavern

00:25:25.460 --> 00:25:30.680
when one vendor had all the fake
reviews for its plugin removed.

00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:36.130
In addition to individual complaints,
there has been press coverage

00:25:36.130 --> 00:25:37.660
of these companies.

00:25:37.660 --> 00:25:40.420
Users with some standing in the
disability community have spoken

00:25:40.420 --> 00:25:43.000
about overlay failures in general.

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:45.978
Some users are so frustrated
they share tips and tools

00:25:45.978 --> 00:25:47.350
to block overlays.

00:25:47.350 --> 00:25:49.740
Two vendors have even
threatened users with lawsuits.

00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:54.710
NBC News ran a story with
the headline Blind People,

00:25:54.710 --> 00:25:58.910
Advocates Slam Company Claiming
to Make Websites ADA Compliant.

00:25:59.970 --> 00:26:02.450
Vice also ran an
article headlined People

00:26:02.450 --> 00:26:05.980
With Disabilities Say This AI Tool
is Making the Web Worse for Them.

00:26:07.380 --> 00:26:10.030
The New York Times published
one over the summer,

00:26:10.030 --> 00:26:13.090
For Blind Internet Users,
the Fix Can Be Worse Than the Flaws.

00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:18.210
The Mosen At Large podcast devoted
an entire episode to the question

00:26:18.210 --> 00:26:20.090
of the value of overlays.

00:26:20.090 --> 00:26:24.100
Episode 105 asked, "Can AI
make the web fully accessible

00:26:24.100 --> 00:26:27.270
in a few short years,
or might it make matters worse?"

00:26:28.310 --> 00:26:31.250
A chunk of a follow-up episode
was devoted to more frustrations

00:26:31.250 --> 00:26:32.360
from users.

00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:34.900
Other community podcasts have
discussed these tools as well.

00:26:36.510 --> 00:26:39.610
Some users are so frustrated
that they have written tools

00:26:39.610 --> 00:26:41.400
to block overlays.

00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:45.110
Accessibegone gives instructions
for how to block overlays

00:26:45.110 --> 00:26:48.150
using ad blockers or by
editing your host file.

00:26:48.150 --> 00:26:51.970
AccessiByeBye is a browser extension
to disable overlays in the browser.

00:26:54.630 --> 00:26:57.360
One overlay has
opted to fight back.

00:26:57.360 --> 00:27:01.010
In April, 2021, FACIL'iti's
attorneys started sending letters

00:27:01.010 --> 00:27:02.840
demanding removal of any criticism.

00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:08.120
This letter to, probably going
to get the name wrong here,

00:27:08.120 --> 00:27:11.640
pronunciation wrong, this
letter to Koena shows two tweets

00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:12.640
about FACIL'iti.

00:27:15.330 --> 00:27:19.070
Koena declined to comply with
the request and wrote about why.

00:27:19.070 --> 00:27:21.260
Another disabled user
who I'm not naming here,

00:27:21.260 --> 00:27:24.210
but I've shared their plight on
Twitter, was subpoenaed to appear

00:27:24.210 --> 00:27:25.510
in court.

00:27:25.510 --> 00:27:31.100
FACIL'iti had asked for 5,000
in damages, 55,000 and fines,

00:27:31.100 --> 00:27:33.280
and in order to cease
comments that may

00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:35.854
"discredit the FACIL'iti solution."

00:27:37.150 --> 00:27:38.750
I cannot think of a
better way to prove

00:27:38.750 --> 00:27:42.520
that your product helps disabled
users than by suing disabled people

00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:43.520
who say it does not.

00:27:45.530 --> 00:27:48.760
That story got some press
in France in Numerama

00:27:48.760 --> 00:27:52.440
with the machine translated
headline, FACIL'iti, the Solution

00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:55.030
for Online Inclusion
That Refuses Criticism?

00:27:57.240 --> 00:28:00.390
Another overlay vendor threatened
a lawsuit for valid criticism,

00:28:00.390 --> 00:28:02.690
specifically AudioEye.

00:28:02.690 --> 00:28:05.430
You can read the AudioEye's
cease and desist letter to me,

00:28:05.430 --> 00:28:11.950
along with my response on my site,
which I do believe I link at the end.

00:28:14.740 --> 00:28:18.250
Overlay vendors also claim
that organizations love them,

00:28:18.250 --> 00:28:20.770
but community and industry
organizations have been clear

00:28:20.771 --> 00:28:21.610
that they do not.

00:28:23.530 --> 00:28:26.790
National Federation of the Blind
after accepting one as a sponsor

00:28:26.790 --> 00:28:30.260
for its annual event went so far
as to not only drop the sponsor,

00:28:30.260 --> 00:28:34.250
but to then issue a statement
rebuking its very existence.

00:28:34.250 --> 00:28:35.670
This part of the
statement stood out to me.

00:28:36.890 --> 00:28:39.150
"In particular,
it is the opinion of the board

00:28:39.150 --> 00:28:43.200
that AccessiBe peremptorily
and scornfully dismisses

00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:46.560
the concerns blind people have
about its products and its approach

00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:48.040
to accessibility.

00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:51.750
The nation's blind will not be
placated, bullied, or bought off.

00:28:51.750 --> 00:28:54.251
Therefore, the board revoked
AccessiBe's sponsorship

00:28:54.252 --> 00:28:57.340
of the convention
On June 22, 2021.""

00:29:00.980 --> 00:29:03.670
The CSUN Assisted Technology
Conference briefly had an overlay

00:29:03.670 --> 00:29:07.090
on its site and was met with
such rapid and vocal anger

00:29:07.090 --> 00:29:09.240
that it was dropped immediately.

00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:10.882
It may very well
have been implemented

00:29:10.882 --> 00:29:12.280
without anybody's knowledge,

00:29:12.280 --> 00:29:16.070
and based on this tweet which
reads, "The accessibility overlay

00:29:16.070 --> 00:29:16.830
has been removed.

00:29:16.830 --> 00:29:18.890
It was implemented
without our approval.

00:29:18.890 --> 00:29:21.720
The Conference does not endorse
this product and we apologize

00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:24.310
for the situation,
which has now been corrected."

00:29:26.910 --> 00:29:30.380
The Olympic Committee created
the WeThe15 site in an effort

00:29:30.380 --> 00:29:34.390
to promote the Paralympics,
but in doing so, used an overlay.

00:29:34.390 --> 00:29:37.100
After responses from users
in the disability community,

00:29:37.100 --> 00:29:39.640
the overlay was removed
within a couple days.

00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:42.690
That same overlay is still
on the Main Olympics website,

00:29:42.690 --> 00:29:45.200
which may be a function of the
vendor promoting it so heavily

00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:46.430
in its marketing materials.

00:29:47.610 --> 00:29:51.920
One of the WeThe15's tweets in
response, "Thank you for alerting us

00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:53.110
about these issues.

00:29:53.110 --> 00:29:56.020
We're disappointed too that
we've fallen short in this area.

00:29:56.020 --> 00:29:57.682
We've gathered together
some new experts

00:29:57.683 --> 00:29:58.980
who are helping us to fix this.

00:29:58.980 --> 00:30:00.830
It would be great to have
your support going forward

00:30:00.830 --> 00:30:03.250
to make the next iteration
a complete success."

00:30:06.260 --> 00:30:08.930
Many overlay vendors claimed
that detractors are really

00:30:08.930 --> 00:30:11.370
just frustrated competitors.

00:30:11.370 --> 00:30:12.950
The Overlay Fact
Sheet disproves that.

00:30:13.970 --> 00:30:17.360
Over 750 people have
signed it so far.

00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:19.770
You could sign it after this talk.

00:30:19.770 --> 00:30:22.310
They represent web
specification contributors,

00:30:22.310 --> 00:30:26.080
internal accessibility experts
from companies in higher education,

00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:29.710
lawyers for the disabled,
contributors to assistive technology,

00:30:29.710 --> 00:30:31.090
and end users with disabilities.

00:30:32.350 --> 00:30:35.340
I encourage you to visit the
site at overlayfactsheet.com

00:30:35.340 --> 00:30:38.760
and read through the information
and links that identify strengths

00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:42.070
and weaknesses of overlay
widgets and automated repair.

00:30:42.070 --> 00:30:45.270
It also touches on technical
and privacy concerns.

00:30:45.270 --> 00:30:47.830
In addition to the signatures,
there are statements from users.

00:30:50.360 --> 00:30:52.140
There is one
professional organization

00:30:52.140 --> 00:30:54.730
for digital accessibility
practitioners.

00:30:54.730 --> 00:30:58.120
International Association of
Accessibility Professionals, IAAP,

00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:04.340
is a division of G3ict, the Global
Initiative for Inclusive Information

00:31:04.340 --> 00:31:06.640
and Communication Technologies.

00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:08.450
It allows membership
for overlay vendors.

00:31:09.510 --> 00:31:12.211
Overlay vendors then brand
their marketing materials

00:31:12.211 --> 00:31:13.572
with the IAAP logo.

00:31:14.670 --> 00:31:17.530
Similarly,
the W3C allows for anyone to set up

00:31:17.530 --> 00:31:19.190
an unaffiliated community group.

00:31:20.340 --> 00:31:23.690
Overlay vendors use these
as veneers of credibility.

00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:29.030
Some organizations display
the IAAP logo in their footer.

00:31:29.030 --> 00:31:32.180
UserWay and Max Access
each do so using the weight

00:31:32.180 --> 00:31:34.620
of accessibility professionals
as a marketing boost.

00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:41.740
Others might get promotional
consideration as AudioEye did

00:31:41.740 --> 00:31:47.260
when IAAP tweeted an AudioEye post,
a post incidentally arguably lifted

00:31:47.260 --> 00:31:48.860
from W3C documents.

00:31:50.670 --> 00:31:53.810
There was finally some
fallout though for IAAP.

00:31:53.810 --> 00:32:01.610
On January 17, few months ago,
IAAP promised a "proactive" response

00:32:01.610 --> 00:32:05.550
to that tweet and overlay membership,
even though I raised the concern

00:32:05.550 --> 00:32:09.190
in September along with
others, in September of 2021.

00:32:10.260 --> 00:32:12.770
It produced a survey from
members and non-members.

00:32:12.770 --> 00:32:15.270
The results of that survey
were posted on Friday,

00:32:15.270 --> 00:32:17.950
February 25th of this year.

00:32:17.950 --> 00:32:24.280
Of the 609 responses 591,
97% were not overlay vendors.

00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:30.000
81% of them, 478 responses state they
do not compete with overlay vendors.

00:32:31.160 --> 00:32:37.340
549 responses or 90% say they have
seen false claims by overlay vendors,

00:32:37.340 --> 00:32:42.430
and 533 responses or 86%
believe IAAP should comment

00:32:42.430 --> 00:32:44.710
on marketing claims in general.

00:32:44.710 --> 00:32:49.040
Also 90%, 549 respondents
believe IAAP should comment

00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:51.400
on overlay marketing
claims specifically.

00:32:54.430 --> 00:32:57.690
In May, representatives from
UserWay and AudiEye proposed

00:32:57.690 --> 00:33:02.490
an overlay community group to the
W3C and got the votes approval

00:33:02.490 --> 00:33:05.820
and call for participation
of in 12 hours.

00:33:05.820 --> 00:33:09.180
The next day it deleted the call
for participation and sat dormant.

00:33:10.340 --> 00:33:14.640
Almost a month later, it renamed
itself to Accessibility at the Edge

00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:18.020
and used a novel interpretation
of Edge computing to justify

00:33:18.020 --> 00:33:20.550
and obfuscate its purpose.

00:33:20.550 --> 00:33:23.960
Two months after that, it reposted
its call for participation,

00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:27.220
this time framing it as an
accessibility community group

00:33:27.220 --> 00:33:31.610
that just happens to include
overlays, and so overlays veneer

00:33:31.610 --> 00:33:34.100
of a W3C blessing is complete.

00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:38.995
This community group
then got a breakout slot

00:33:38.996 --> 00:33:40.800
at W3C's Technical Plenary

00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:45.130
and Advisory Committee or
TPAC session in September.

00:33:45.130 --> 00:33:48.270
There, the UserWay COO
took three opportunities

00:33:48.270 --> 00:33:51.290
to promote its own
product in this session.

00:33:51.290 --> 00:33:54.140
This despite every
attendee, except for one

00:33:54.140 --> 00:33:56.348
of the community
groups invited guests,

00:33:56.349 --> 00:34:00.410
voicing their broad opposition
to overlays for an hour.

00:34:03.190 --> 00:34:06.200
As we have seen,
overlays cannot make your site

00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:07.620
or your brand better overnight.

00:34:08.750 --> 00:34:12.110
To wrap up this talk, I want to
cover some steps you can undertake

00:34:12.110 --> 00:34:13.150
without overlays.

00:34:14.900 --> 00:34:15.900
Plan ahead.

00:34:17.530 --> 00:34:18.530
Have a drink of water.

00:34:21.860 --> 00:34:22.860
Excuse me.

00:34:23.940 --> 00:34:24.850
Plan ahead.

00:34:24.850 --> 00:34:28.180
Hire a consultant who has
some experience in the space.

00:34:28.180 --> 00:34:31.600
They can help you choose a vendor
who prioritizes accessibility

00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:33.490
and write this into your contracts.

00:34:33.490 --> 00:34:36.910
They can also direct you to
technologies that have been vetted.

00:34:36.910 --> 00:34:39.870
Some platforms have
accessible features already.

00:34:39.870 --> 00:34:45.350
Last I checked, WordPress offers 114
free accessibility-ready themes built

00:34:45.350 --> 00:34:47.460
with a baseline of
compliance already in place.

00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:55.310
Some free online resources, when you
create content, use those resources.

00:34:55.310 --> 00:34:58.000
They may have all you
need to get going.

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:00.680
There is even a free tool to
generate an accessibility statement

00:35:00.680 --> 00:35:03.590
for your site provided
by the very organization

00:35:03.590 --> 00:35:05.200
that sets accessibility standards.

00:35:07.290 --> 00:35:09.270
What if you already have a site?

00:35:09.270 --> 00:35:12.260
You can use one of the many free
automated accessibility checkers

00:35:12.260 --> 00:35:14.720
on the market, assuming you
aren't interested in getting

00:35:14.720 --> 00:35:16.740
into the browser's own tools.

00:35:16.740 --> 00:35:21.920
There's ARC, Axe, Lighthouse,
WAVE, and webhint among others.

00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:25.300
While they will not catch all
the issues, maybe only about 30%,

00:35:25.300 --> 00:35:27.640
they will at least give you
a sense where you stand.

00:35:28.970 --> 00:35:31.180
Where you have gaps, document them.

00:35:31.180 --> 00:35:33.900
Identify what is wrong and put
together a plan and timeline

00:35:33.900 --> 00:35:35.300
to address them.

00:35:35.300 --> 00:35:39.380
Publish that on your site when you
generate an accessibility statement.

00:35:39.380 --> 00:35:42.100
As long as you're under the
timelines you provide, you can choose

00:35:42.100 --> 00:35:45.060
what your ongoing budget
will be to address them,

00:35:45.060 --> 00:35:46.720
even if it's only $1,000 per year.

00:35:49.520 --> 00:35:51.920
If you are affected by
overlays as a consumer,

00:35:51.920 --> 00:35:53.930
then you can take some action.

00:35:53.930 --> 00:35:57.010
In the US, the Federal Trade
Commission has rules that advertising

00:35:57.010 --> 00:36:01.930
must not be deceptive, must include
evidence and cannot be unfair.

00:36:01.930 --> 00:36:04.830
Overlayfalseclaims.com
provides documented examples

00:36:04.830 --> 00:36:10.070
of overlay vendor false claims, along
with consumer complaint resources

00:36:10.070 --> 00:36:14.250
for the US, Federal and State,
Canada, and New Zealand.

00:36:14.250 --> 00:36:17.890
You can use information there to
file a false advertising complaint.

00:36:17.890 --> 00:36:21.520
You can also open up here to submit
information for filing complaints

00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:22.520
in other countries.

00:36:24.540 --> 00:36:26.860
To wrap up the session,
I have posted links to

00:36:26.860 --> 00:36:30.050
some of the material I referenced
throughout, you can get to it

00:36:30.050 --> 00:36:34.740
by scanning the QR code,
no, pointing the wrong way,

00:36:34.740 --> 00:36:37.430
scanning the QR code
over there or by going

00:36:37.430 --> 00:36:47.439
to the URL rosel.li/WPa11yDay-22.

00:36:48.540 --> 00:36:50.608
I'm going to say that again
because it was sloppy.

00:36:51.276 --> 00:36:59.570
That's rosel.li/WPa11yDay-22.

00:37:02.380 --> 00:37:02.890
That's it.

00:37:02.890 --> 00:37:03.290
Thank you.

00:37:03.290 --> 00:37:05.750
Feel free to ask me some questions.

00:37:05.750 --> 00:37:07.310
I think I finished
a little bit early.

00:37:08.440 --> 00:37:09.440
Awkward.

00:37:10.395 --> 00:37:13.470
<v Carrie> Hey,
thank you so much, Adrian.

00:37:13.470 --> 00:37:15.310
That's fascinating.

00:37:15.310 --> 00:37:17.286
I actually feel a
little bit gross hearing

00:37:17.287 --> 00:37:18.710
about some of those practices.

00:37:18.710 --> 00:37:21.150
Thank you for educating us.

00:37:21.150 --> 00:37:24.450
We've got some great
questions coming in.

00:37:24.450 --> 00:37:27.230
Early on, you mentioned that
the text resizer might be used

00:37:27.230 --> 00:37:31.220
to gather data about how
many users want larger fonts.

00:37:31.220 --> 00:37:35.390
Have you ever seen data on usage
of these features like text resize,

00:37:35.390 --> 00:37:38.050
contrast, or dark mode toggles?

00:37:38.050 --> 00:37:41.730
I can't find any and when I look
and I suspect custom coding needs

00:37:41.730 --> 00:37:42.730
is not worth the effort.

00:37:45.030 --> 00:37:50.530
<v Adrian> I have had a couple of
clients who have put widgets on it.

00:37:50.530 --> 00:37:53.094
They rolled their own
text resizing widget,

00:37:53.095 --> 00:37:54.900
which was the example I cited.

00:37:54.900 --> 00:37:58.090
They tracked how
often people used it.

00:37:58.090 --> 00:38:01.770
They took that information, quickly
found out their text was too small,

00:38:01.770 --> 00:38:03.340
and then addressed it.

00:38:03.340 --> 00:38:06.410
As for pre-existing tools
or scripts that do that,

00:38:06.410 --> 00:38:11.090
you pretty much have to custom roll
your own for your site is my guess.

00:38:11.090 --> 00:38:12.983
That might be a really
nifty WordPress plugin

00:38:12.984 --> 00:38:15.950
for somebody to build,
just saying.

00:38:15.950 --> 00:38:16.569
<v Carrie> There you go.

00:38:18.520 --> 00:38:20.390
Another question
for you about IAAP.

00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:24.030
Is there any update
whether they will continue

00:38:24.030 --> 00:38:27.740
to allow overlay companies to
be members who exploit this

00:38:27.740 --> 00:38:28.740
for credibility?

00:38:31.209 --> 00:38:33.240
<v Adrian> What I like about
that question is there are

00:38:33.240 --> 00:38:35.180
a few different ways
I could answer that.

00:38:35.180 --> 00:38:40.760
I think the simplest is
that IAAP hired Ken Nakata,

00:38:40.760 --> 00:38:44.800
contracted Ken Nakata, I think
he's converged accessibility,

00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:52.060
to gather information and start
to put together a rough framework

00:38:52.060 --> 00:38:58.410
for best practices for how members
should behave in the marketplace.

00:38:58.410 --> 00:39:01.920
Overlay vendors were included
with that, as well as me

00:39:01.920 --> 00:39:05.160
and some people who've
been critical of overlays.

00:39:05.160 --> 00:39:08.630
Ken did a great job of keeping
us apart from each other.

00:39:08.630 --> 00:39:13.210
Go, Ken,
but that's still in a draft stage

00:39:13.210 --> 00:39:18.140
and I am not an IAAP member,
I'm not planning to be one.

00:39:18.140 --> 00:39:22.000
I don't have any insight
internally on where it is

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:25.070
in their final editing
or approvals process.

00:39:25.964 --> 00:39:26.780
<v Carrie> Makes sense.

00:39:26.780 --> 00:39:29.160
Do you think that was a
sufficient response from them

00:39:29.160 --> 00:39:30.580
or would you have liked
to have seen more?

00:39:31.993 --> 00:39:37.880
<v Adrian> I feel that I would
have liked to have seen more.

00:39:37.880 --> 00:39:43.440
I would have liked a stronger stance
prior to allowing the membership.

00:39:44.460 --> 00:39:46.290
That's just my personal opinion.

00:39:46.290 --> 00:39:48.840
My strongly held belief which
is a clause I put in there

00:39:48.840 --> 00:39:50.490
because of litigious
overlay vendors.

00:39:51.830 --> 00:39:52.830
<v Carrie> Thank you.

00:39:53.970 --> 00:39:54.620
Let's see.

00:39:54.620 --> 00:39:58.200
AccessiBe offers free
ADA site testing.

00:39:58.200 --> 00:40:00.220
I'm assuming we can't
trust this testing.

00:40:00.220 --> 00:40:02.530
What should we use
to test our sites?

00:40:02.530 --> 00:40:05.550
<v Adrian> I listed a
bunch toward the end there.

00:40:06.730 --> 00:40:14.900
Axe, webhint, ARC,
TPGi's ARC product, WebAim's WAVE.

00:40:14.900 --> 00:40:18.990
Those are all good tools that
have some history behind them,

00:40:18.990 --> 00:40:21.640
and the companies that built
them have practitioners

00:40:21.641 --> 00:40:23.930
in there who've been
in the space for a long time.

00:40:25.090 --> 00:40:28.810
The issue with
AccessiBe's own checker,

00:40:28.810 --> 00:40:31.340
because I've done some
side-by-side comparison,

00:40:31.340 --> 00:40:39.800
is it finds issues I would not
flag that map directly to features

00:40:39.800 --> 00:40:41.500
of their own product.

00:40:41.500 --> 00:40:43.710
They raised issues that
aren't really issues.

00:40:43.710 --> 00:40:46.140
I've documented some
of that on my site,

00:40:46.140 --> 00:40:49.380
and I think some of it is
linked from that QR code,

00:40:49.380 --> 00:40:51.600
which I don't think
is displaying anymore.

00:40:51.600 --> 00:40:54.650
There's some additional
information there.

00:40:54.650 --> 00:40:57.510
I'm good to answer
some more questions.

00:40:57.510 --> 00:40:58.950
I don't want us to run over time.

00:41:00.158 --> 00:41:00.440
<v Carrie> Yes.

00:41:00.440 --> 00:41:03.270
We've got a few minutes,
if you don't mind hanging with me-

00:41:03.270 --> 00:41:04.120
<v Adrian> Yes, happy to do it.

00:41:04.120 --> 00:41:05.245
<v Carrie> -people
still have questions.

00:41:06.790 --> 00:41:11.740
Can you talk about why you
had redacted in your talk?

00:41:11.740 --> 00:41:12.971
<v Adrian> Oh, yes.

00:41:13.850 --> 00:41:19.077
Specifically, there were two
vendors-- well, three actually,

00:41:19.077 --> 00:41:23.927
so I had to remove redacted
and redacted because redacted,

00:41:23.928 --> 00:41:28.040
so I opted not to leave them
in there because redacted.

00:41:28.040 --> 00:41:32.870
Then the third vendor was
listed in one of the screenshots

00:41:32.870 --> 00:41:38.270
and redacted had some issues
with that, so I redacted.

00:41:40.698 --> 00:41:43.220
<v Carrie> That's
a lot of sharpies.

00:41:43.220 --> 00:41:43.835
<v Adrian> Yes.

00:41:43.835 --> 00:41:46.190
<v Carrie> [laughs]

00:41:46.190 --> 00:41:48.510
<v Adrian> In case nobody
noticed, there was a whole slide

00:41:48.510 --> 00:41:51.150
in there where I was sent
a cease-and-desist letter

00:41:51.150 --> 00:41:55.760
by a highly paid law firm,
so yes, I am this one guy.

00:41:55.760 --> 00:41:59.080
<v Carrie> I look forward to
checking out those slides.

00:42:02.970 --> 00:42:08.440
If somebody were to, I don't
know, had a client-- or I guess

00:42:08.440 --> 00:42:11.680
if you had someone that was
interested in using an overlay

00:42:11.680 --> 00:42:15.570
and a consultant was trying
to convince a client that

00:42:15.570 --> 00:42:19.710
that's a terrible idea,
if you have the elevator pitch

00:42:19.710 --> 00:42:24.820
of how a consultant could
describe that to a client?

00:42:26.144 --> 00:42:28.370
<v Adrian> Could describe
the risk [crosstalk]

00:42:28.370 --> 00:42:30.340
<v Carrie> That they
should not use the overlay.

00:42:32.762 --> 00:42:35.520
<v Adrian> This very much depends
on the person I'm talking to.

00:42:36.640 --> 00:42:39.300
Overlay vendors have a pretty
clear marketing message

00:42:39.300 --> 00:42:45.280
where they're using FUD,
fear, uncertainty, and doubt,

00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:47.130
and it's all about
threat of lawsuit.

00:42:49.090 --> 00:42:51.560
If I identify the person I'm
talking to is just trying

00:42:51.560 --> 00:42:55.150
to avoid lawsuits,
I explain to them how easy it is

00:42:55.150 --> 00:42:58.920
to set up a process
to dodge the lawsuit.

00:42:58.920 --> 00:43:03.420
By "dodge", I mean do some
checks, make some fixes,

00:43:03.420 --> 00:43:06.870
document what you have to do,
and do it on whatever timeline

00:43:06.870 --> 00:43:08.990
as long as you document it.

00:43:08.990 --> 00:43:12.570
It is startlingly easy
to avoid getting sued.

00:43:13.780 --> 00:43:18.420
It's a lot harder to go
through and fix every detail.

00:43:18.420 --> 00:43:22.140
Léonie Watson has said this
famously a couple times,

00:43:22.140 --> 00:43:25.950
"It's not about," and I'm
horribly paraphrasing it,

00:43:25.950 --> 00:43:27.900
"It's not about getting
everything right today,

00:43:27.900 --> 00:43:29.850
it's just about doing
better each day.

00:43:29.850 --> 00:43:32.200
A little bit better each day."

00:43:32.200 --> 00:43:34.970
If a company is committed
to it and doesn't look at it

00:43:34.970 --> 00:43:38.580
as a legal risk,
they'll generally be fine.

00:43:38.580 --> 00:43:42.380
I think my fourth last slide,
which I mentioned in the blog post,

00:43:42.380 --> 00:43:45.970
just four quick bullets
and you're in good shape.

00:43:45.970 --> 00:43:48.660
That's the kind of
conversation I have with

00:43:48.660 --> 00:43:52.370
some potentially worried clients.

00:43:52.370 --> 00:43:53.420
<v Carrie> Thank you.

00:43:55.440 --> 00:43:57.630
Here's one, a great
question, "I'm fairly new

00:43:57.630 --> 00:44:00.010
to the whole overlays concept.

00:44:00.010 --> 00:44:02.810
Why did this end up as a
growing tech in the first place,

00:44:02.810 --> 00:44:04.130
and was it ever useful?"

00:44:06.539 --> 00:44:08.110
<v Adrian> To answer
the second part,

00:44:08.110 --> 00:44:10.850
evidence suggests they
were never useful.

00:44:10.850 --> 00:44:13.880
Even going back 10 years to
Browsealoud and some of the others,

00:44:13.880 --> 00:44:15.430
they weren't useful.

00:44:15.430 --> 00:44:20.250
They are a growing technology
simply because somebody made

00:44:20.250 --> 00:44:23.325
a business case about,
"Here's how many disabled people are

00:44:23.326 --> 00:44:24.350
in the world.

00:44:24.350 --> 00:44:26.840
Here's an entire market
we could tap into

00:44:26.840 --> 00:44:29.690
just by selling this
overlay product.

00:44:29.690 --> 00:44:33.780
We will pitch it as
legal-risk mitigation."

00:44:33.780 --> 00:44:34.650
That's really it.

00:44:34.650 --> 00:44:39.530
They didn't have the experience, they
didn't understand all the aspects

00:44:39.530 --> 00:44:42.319
of it,
which is evident in the tooling,

00:44:42.320 --> 00:44:44.410
and they got venture funding.

00:44:44.410 --> 00:44:47.430
As we know,
a lot of businesses that are backed

00:44:47.430 --> 00:44:52.010
by venture funds aren't
necessarily fully fleshed out.

00:44:52.010 --> 00:44:55.440
In many cases, they're still building
the airplane as they're falling

00:44:55.440 --> 00:44:56.580
out of the sky.

00:44:56.580 --> 00:44:59.100
I think that's sort of the
scenario that we're seeing here.

00:44:59.100 --> 00:45:04.800
When you have a startup culture,
the move-fast-and-break-things model

00:45:04.800 --> 00:45:10.080
doesn't apply to the kind of rigor
that is necessary for dealing

00:45:10.080 --> 00:45:11.240
with humans.

00:45:11.240 --> 00:45:13.629
Accessibility is not really
a technology problem,

00:45:13.630 --> 00:45:14.680
it's a human problem.

00:45:15.840 --> 00:45:16.630
That's where we have it.

00:45:17.915 --> 00:45:18.640
<v Carrie> It makes sense.

00:45:18.640 --> 00:45:19.640
Thank you.

00:45:20.460 --> 00:45:23.470
We will go ahead and wrap up.

00:45:23.470 --> 00:45:25.720
Thank you so much, Adrian,
for sharing your knowledge

00:45:25.720 --> 00:45:27.660
and sharing your slides.

00:45:27.660 --> 00:45:29.350
I really enjoyed that.

00:45:29.350 --> 00:45:33.060
Thank you everyone who tuned
in for attending this session

00:45:33.060 --> 00:45:34.480
with Adrian Roselli.

00:45:34.480 --> 00:45:37.310

hashtag WPA11Day and WPAD2022.

00:45:48.379 --> 00:45:50.290
We also really appreciate
if you would go

00:45:50.290 --> 00:45:53.390
