WEBVTT

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:34.100
<v Host> We have Peteris
Jurcenko, CEO, UX designer

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.430
and accessibility expert
at SIA Turn Digital.

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.330
He's giving us a presentation on
the future of accessibility sorry,

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:44.760
the future of
accessibility statement.

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.080
And that will be the last
lightning round talk we have

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.860
for the WordPress
Accessibility Day.

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.220
All right Peter,
let's bring it home for us.

00:00:57.109 --> 00:00:59.550
<v Peteris Jurcenko>
Hello, my name is Peteris

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.850
and four years ago
[speaking foreign language]

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.540
we created an initiative
[speaking foreign language]

00:01:06.541 --> 00:01:10.581
which means accessibility
dot LV in Latvian.

00:01:10.581 --> 00:01:15.475
We do research and
training on accessibility

00:01:15.475 --> 00:01:19.940
but we have also
create practical tools.

00:01:21.081 --> 00:01:23.850
For example, schoolofvp .com [?]

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.320
is a platform based on
WordPress for school

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.070
to create accessible
websites and field days.

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.460
We have also created accessibility
statement generation plug in.

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.830
And I will tell you in more
details about this plug-in.

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:46.290
But for beginning,
what is accessibility statement?

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.190
I will describe it as a page
on the website that tells you

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.970
what is accessible and what is
not accessible on this website.

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:00.170
And who to contact
in case of problems.

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.010
Usually, the link on this
page is in the footer

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:08.130
somewhere next the privacy policy.

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:15.160
Here you can see examples and links
on the European Parliament go UK

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.600
and the US presidents page.

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.470
Why provide an
accessibility statement?

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.310
In some situation,
you may be required

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.880
to provide an accessibility
statement such as public institution

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.450
in countries that implement
the [unintelligible 02:37]

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:34.900
web accessibility directed.

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:43.640
The main reasons are to show users
that you care about accessibility

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:44.640
and about them.

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.710
Provide information which content
on your page is accessible

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:52.410
and which is not and
how to deal with it.

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.080
Publish information about
accessibility information

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:01.530
and contact information if users
need help with contact accessibility.

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:05.121
Demonstrate commitment
to accessibility

00:03:05.122 --> 00:03:07.050
and to social responsibility.

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.130
What to include in an
accessibility statement?

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.990
It depends on the
country and regulation.

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:19.800
Some countries have templates.

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:23.290
Some examples include the
results of web assimilation.

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:29.810
Web accessibility initiative
recommends include: commitment

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:37.140
to accessibility, which accessibility
standards such as WCAG 2.1

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:44.210
and which level A to AAA is
applied, conduct information

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:48.300
and response time in case
users encounter problems.

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.914
It's also good practice
to provide information

00:03:53.915 --> 00:03:56.070
about any known limitation

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:59.110
in your website to avoid
frustration of your users.

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:02.220
For example,
old videos do not have subtitles.

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:08.390
Measures taken by your organization
to ensure accessibility.

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:13.760
For example, websites
assimilation and user methodology.

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:20.780
Technical prerequisites such
as supported web browsers.

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:24.700
Environments in which the
content has been tested to work

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:29.880
and also references to apply
national and local laws and policies.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.320
Is accessibility
statement acquired?

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:36.800
It depends,
on which country or website operates

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.560
in which sector your
organization operates.

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:42.690
For example, In Latin,
our government implements

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:46.690
European government
directive which is mandatory

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:50.450
in the public institutions in
the publicly owned companies

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:54.190
but it is not mandatory
to private companies yet.

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:59.720
On the website, web accessibility
initiative you can see regulations

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:04.990
in every country but this
information is mostly from 2018

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:12.490
and they plan to start publishing
the updates in this November.

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:18.560
Here you can see example of
Nordic insurance company.

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:22.260
This is a private company that
operates in seven countries

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.010
with different regulation.

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:28.060
You can see the link related
to accessibility is only free

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:29.060
on their websites.

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:36.390
It is interesting that Apple defines
accessibility as Apple value,

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:39.950
but this is not translated
in every language.

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:44.970
For example, in Latin websites only
privacy was mentioned as a value.

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:52.320
So, if you are planning to
include accessibility statement

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:55.310
on your website is there
a tool or generator

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:58.680
which can help you generate
and accessibility statement.

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:04.990
First dimension is web accessibility
initiative accessibility

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:06.710
statement generator.

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:11.930
You can fill in a simple form
and generate a plain HTML file.

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:14.980
All fields are fill in examples.

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:20.320
Another publicly available
tool and accessibility

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:26.730
and ability statement generator
from Portugal’s government system.

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:31.820
It requires more detailed information
including userability test

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:33.950
for people with disabilities.

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:38.100
As a result, you get an HTML
file which you can copy and paste

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:39.100
to your website.

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:43.180
There is a similar tool
of Belgian government.

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:48.630
And a very nice tool is
from [unintelligible].

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:58.780
All tools provide form to be filled
in and generated at HTML file.

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:03.680
There are some issues
with this approach.

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:08.070
Information is either
too general for the needs

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:12.680
of different countries or to
specific if the tool is designed

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:14.410
for specific country.

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:18.220
It would be nice to adapt this
tool for different countries

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:21.950
but it's not possible as
they are not plug-ins.

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:25.430
Some of the generation provide
source code but you need to run

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:27.300
and the host this tool somewhere.

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:33.120
As they do not have central
plug-in and installation.

00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:40.200
All generators provided
result as HTML block or file.

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:45.170
Which means it is hard to
update next year and problems

00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:49.440
to copy paste in
machine readable format.

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:52.310
And yes,
this is not the WordPress way.

00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:59.590
We tried to solve previously
mentioned issues in the WordPress way

00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:02.721
and one of them is
a WordPress plug-in

00:08:02.722 --> 00:08:05.370
and I will demonstrate it later.

00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:10.480
Another approach is create and
publish accessibility statement

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:12.590
for each country as a pattern.

00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:17.730
Which pattern will not
solve all the problems

00:08:17.730 --> 00:08:19.960
with machine readable format.

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:24.390
For example,
if you have a planned update syntax

00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:30.320
or ID you can do it only for new
content not for previously published.

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:34.950
The plug-in update you can improve
machine readable afterwards.

00:08:37.470 --> 00:08:40.270
What to expect from
WordPress plug-in.

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:45.310
Provide information and links
to local regulation website,

00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:49.780
provide tax examples,
description, edit not create,

00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:55.290
fill some custom fields,
result work in any theme,

00:08:55.290 --> 00:08:59.210
provide only semantic
content not style, result

00:08:59.210 --> 00:09:03.480
in machine readable format,
content can be easily updated

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:07.740
like normal page, ability to
customize template content

00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:10.630
from WordPress admin
not only from code.

00:09:10.630 --> 00:09:12.180
Let's see how it works.

00:09:13.270 --> 00:09:17.956
When you activate accessibility
statement plug-in,

00:09:17.957 --> 00:09:20.070
it will create a page.

00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:22.599
Accessibility statement
because this plug-in is

00:09:22.599 --> 00:09:25.665
in Latvian [unintelligible]

00:09:26.133 --> 00:09:31.780
when you edit this page, and use
ACF if you have it to use your home.

00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:38.960
If you're not have it to use
in ACF which was available

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:40.790
open source previously.

00:09:42.510 --> 00:09:47.210
Here you can fill in the form.

00:09:47.210 --> 00:09:55.760
You have a link to local guidelines
where you can get information out

00:09:55.760 --> 00:10:00.450
to check and what to include in
this accessibility statement.

00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:04.590
And it works like
normal WordPress page.

00:10:04.590 --> 00:10:07.470
You can update,
you can preview changes.

00:10:07.470 --> 00:10:13.210
And for example, here it creates
semantic HTML inside the WordPress

00:10:13.210 --> 00:10:16.290
and if you change theme
it works with any theme

00:10:16.290 --> 00:10:19.790
if you change it works
with another team as well

00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:22.200
because it's only
HTML without style.

00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:26.310
What we get in this HTML?

00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:30.350
We get machine
readable text as well.

00:10:30.350 --> 00:10:32.610
And if you want to
change this template,

00:10:32.610 --> 00:10:38.030
to change this machine readable you
can do it from WordPress illustration

00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:42.250
as well go to the settings
accessibility statement settings

00:10:42.250 --> 00:10:51.760
and here is text and the classes
are specific text for creation.

00:10:53.900 --> 00:11:00.250
What I think about future of
WordPress accessibility statement

00:11:00.250 --> 00:11:01.960
actually it's two ways.

00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:09.790
We like plug-in one or many
plug-ins and new patterned library.

00:11:09.790 --> 00:11:18.890
I think pattern library is easy way
but you cannot update some things

00:11:18.890 --> 00:11:21.180
after you publish this statement.

00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:28.220
In plug-in way it's possible to
update the machine readable text

00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:31.040
and information with
plug-in updates afterwards.

00:11:32.070 --> 00:11:42.160
And yeah, if some content change
plug-ins more better way to use

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:43.160
in WordPress.

00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:46.120
Thank you, that's all for me.
