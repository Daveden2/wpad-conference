00:00:33.266 --> 00:00:34.620
<v Jay McKay> Hello, everyone.

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.750
Welcome to WordPress
Accessibility Day.

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:41.500
My name is Jay McKay, and I am
the Director of Community Programs

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.180
at Nobility.

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.640
This session is going to be a
lightning round of three short talks

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.920
that have been prerecorded.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.590
Our first talk will be Can the
Cloud Accelerate Accessibility,

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:59.310
presented by, Robert Jacobi, who’s
Director of WordPress, Cloudways.

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:04.530
The second talk will be Aria
State Management and Modern CSS,

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.460
presented by, Nick Croft,
Lead Developer at Reaktiv Studios,

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.310
and the third session will
be Introducing Accessibility

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:17.580
to Existing Designs, presented
by, Katie Gleason, Web Designer

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:18.760
at WP Engine.

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.390
For this session, there will not be
a Q&A during the lightning round,

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.100
but please feel free to use
the ideas section to chat

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:29.340
with other attendees.

00:01:42.209 --> 00:01:43.390
<v Robert Jacobi> Hello, everyone.

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.360
I'm Robert Jacobi,
Director of WordPress at Cloudways,

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.550
and it's my great
pleasure to talk about

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:52.920
whether the cloud can
accelerate accessibility.

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:55.970
Let's jump right into it.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.930
What cloud are we talking about?

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.850
I like to look at the cloud
in a couple of different ways.

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.010
There are some of the more
traditional understandings

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:16.960
of what the cloud is, and then a
couple of other parts and pieces.

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:21.420
I like to think about it first and
foremost from a hosting perspective.

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:22.040
Why?

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.060
Because everything
is hosted somewhere.

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:30.350
No matter what kind of application,
whether it's on, you know, AWS,

00:02:30.351 --> 00:02:35.050
Digital Ocean, Cloudways,
or self-hosted, some other kind

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:38.900
of virtual private server,
everything is hosted somewhere.

00:02:39.606 --> 00:02:44.430
Hosting is the critical component
of everything that's online.

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.720
I know it's probably pretty
self-explanatory and obvious,

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:54.100
but this means that folks who are
in hosting have a critical role

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:57.000
in how quickly
accessibility is adopted.

00:02:59.339 --> 00:03:02.630
My next cloud is the cloud
of interaction social media.

00:03:03.266 --> 00:03:05.150
Tons of user generated content.

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:09.730
This is the place where folks
come in and out to drop in videos,

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:14.120
images, texts, audio, everything.

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:20.367
Of course, we’re talking about
Instagram, twitter, Pinterest.

00:03:20.367 --> 00:03:22.502
Whatever is out there [chuckle]

00:03:22.502 --> 00:03:27.370
that can really be
considered social.

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:28.880
It's hugely important.

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.310
So much information is
going back and forth.

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:35.260
So, we have our hosting cloud,
sort of our social media cloud,

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:38.650
and then software
as a service cloud.

00:03:39.586 --> 00:03:44.290
Every other application online,
and we use these things all the time.

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:51.550
Everything from our banks, you know,
QuickBooks, Adobe's Creative Cloud.

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:54.300
All kinds of applications.

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:59.560
Microsoft 365, Google Workspace,
you know, that's that software

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.480
as a service cloud.

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:05.612
It tries to cover all of
those more niche applications

00:04:05.612 --> 00:04:12.700
that I wouldn't say that are
typically hosting or social media.

00:04:15.088 --> 00:04:20.793
Our next question is, does the cloud
actually understand accessibility?

00:04:20.794 --> 00:04:22.010
What do I mean by that?

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:26.240
Have they done some of that
homework that's even necessary

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:33.650
to really ramp up and accelerate
accessibility for everyone?

00:04:34.908 --> 00:04:39.460
Let's take a look at a
couple of quick items.

00:04:41.709 --> 00:04:44.860
Is that cloud provider,
whether it's a hosting company,

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:48.920
social media company,
some other software as a service,

00:04:50.057 --> 00:04:51.310
is their site accessible?

00:04:52.693 --> 00:04:58.320
Are they doing some of the legwork
to implement accessibility,

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.040
you know, on their own?

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:03.590
That's usually a first step for
a lot of projects in development.

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:05.990
You're going to try things
out on your own and see

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:07.260
what best practices are.

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:12.320
So, one way to see whether
that cloud provider is looking

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:20.400
to the future around being
taking accessibility seriously is

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.050
whether their site is
actually assessable.

00:05:24.664 --> 00:05:26.250
Do they have an accessibility team?

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:30.390
Now this is critical for a small
to medium to large size business.

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:34.730
A lot of times that team can
be outsourced, of course.

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:39.570
I recommend having human participants
on that accessibility team.

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:46.480
A lot of the software
solutions are I find today are

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:51.510
still much riskier than having
folks who are completely embedded

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:55.400
and understand what the necessary
requirements for accessibility are

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:57.560
so other accessibility
experts on staff.

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:02.600
Again, we are looking at, you
know, where cloud providers, again,

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:08.160
hosting social media, SES,
whether, you know, whether they're

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:11.650
on the road to being successful
on accessibility to see

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:15.390
how quickly they will support
some of the ideas I have

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:17.040
for accessibility in the future.

00:06:18.378 --> 00:06:22.470
So other accessibility experts
on staff and then sort of almost

00:06:24.251 --> 00:06:28.424
at the furthest level,
is there actual assessable support

00:06:28.424 --> 00:06:29.689
for customers?

00:06:30.056 --> 00:06:36.120
Is this some kind of chat
bot that really doesn't work

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:38.490
with all sorts of
assessable applications?

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:43.260
Is it completely incompatible
with screen readers?

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:49.120
Is there an understanding
on support teams that they

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:52.020
may be interacting with someone
who has assessable requirements?

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:54.900
So, you know,
understanding, again, where

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:57.920
on the spectrum a cloud provider
might be, I think is critical,

00:06:59.312 --> 00:07:02.130
because the cloud can help a lot.

00:07:03.521 --> 00:07:04.840
Where could the cloud help?

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:11.800
In literally everything,
and it's interesting how especially

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:15.835
how it can benefit
WordPress, developers,

00:07:15.835 --> 00:07:17.850
agencies, and even end users.

00:07:19.005 --> 00:07:21.640
The cloud can help,
first and foremost,

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:24.630
by enforcing front-end
accessibility.

00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:28.680
I mentioned user created
content earlier, because I think

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:35.440
that it's almost a quick and
dirty way to start dropping

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:45.430
in some type of accessibility that
is clear, easy, understood well.

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:51.040
My favorite example is if you
are going to upload an image,

00:07:52.441 --> 00:07:56.710
that image can't be uploaded
without proper tagging, period.

00:07:59.079 --> 00:08:01.300
The cloud can enforce this.

00:08:01.882 --> 00:08:05.830
I mean, it's so easy for all
of these applications that,

00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:08.660
you know, tie into your camera
and just be like, upload away,

00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:12.440
upload away, but the cloud can
force front-end accessibility

00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:16.230
and say, Thanks for your
image, we can't publish this

00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:19.910
until you fill out
assessable content.

00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:25.980
That move in itself would
greatly benefit the Internet

00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:28.730
for accessibility requirements.

00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:33.770
We can do that with all
sorts of content, obviously.

00:08:33.770 --> 00:08:37.420
So, if we are looking at,
you know, I mentioned images,

00:08:37.420 --> 00:08:41.350
because I think that's probably one
of the easiest enforceability aspects

00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:49.840
on the front-end, but also obviously
video, audio, going through

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:50.800
some of that legwork.

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:56.420
Maybe even offering it as some
type of upsell to make sure

00:08:56.420 --> 00:08:57.750
that it's done right.

00:08:57.750 --> 00:09:00.770
I mentioned I'm not a big
fan of automated solutions,

00:09:00.770 --> 00:09:02.790
but they're sometimes
better than nothing, right?

00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:08.730
So, again, having a level of
front-end accessibility enforcement

00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:12.730
I think is critical to the
success of the Internet,

00:09:12.730 --> 00:09:17.200
as well as something that can
dramatically accelerate the adoption

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:22.470
of good accessibility on the
Internet by these cloud providers.

00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:23.330
[clears throat]

00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:26.750
That’s right, hosting companies
can make that requirement.

00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:33.280
It's really education for
both developers and end-users

00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:37.370
that this is going to be part
of the process, you know,

00:09:37.370 --> 00:09:44.010
we don't allow bad tagging anymore
in HTML for that same reason.

00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:46.890
It's going to take
me to the next bit

00:09:46.890 --> 00:09:49.490
of the conversation is enforcing
infrastructure accessibility,

00:09:49.490 --> 00:09:50.930
render with standards.

00:09:50.930 --> 00:10:00.060
Everything should be, you know,
run through some kind of code checker

00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:03.760
and enforcing on the
backend is really important

00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:09.380
that improves the quality of
code, obviously,

00:10:10.944 --> 00:10:15.570
and makes that code also assessable
to folks who want to update it.

00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:18.900
So, if you think about that in
the open-source space, but can

00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:25.650
from sort of a bottom-up
start percolating

00:10:25.650 --> 00:10:30.640
on the earlier side talking about
enforcing front-end standards.

00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:34.280
Going one step, one step at a time.

00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:36.660
Tied very closely to
infrastructure, of course,

00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:39.000
is third-party accessibility.

00:10:40.158 --> 00:10:42.160
The cloud can enforce
third-party accessibility.

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:47.280
Don't accept Plugins,
JavaScripts, and APIs

00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:48.770
that have not been
thoroughly vetted.

00:10:48.770 --> 00:10:52.280
The cloud can make sure that
happens either as a provider

00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:57.030
of those services or as a,
you know, a recipient end-user

00:10:57.030 --> 00:10:57.740
of those services.

00:10:57.740 --> 00:11:01.030
We don't need WordPress
Plugins that aren't successful.

00:11:01.030 --> 00:11:05.500
We don't need bad JavaScript
that screws up page rendering.

00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:09.550
We don't need APIs that
don't spit out data

00:11:09.550 --> 00:11:17.370
that isn't accessibly tagged,
that isn't ready to be repurposed

00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:19.780
in an assessable standard.

00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:23.470
So many times, we are getting
content images, media directly

00:11:23.470 --> 00:11:25.650
from the API,
and that's all we are getting.

00:11:25.650 --> 00:11:27.500
We are not getting all of
the metadata around that

00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:32.180
that could actually utilize to create
a much more assessable experience

00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:40.180
for folks, and really accessibility
improves the web all around.

00:11:40.180 --> 00:11:44.460
If you think about the enforcement
of front-end, back-end,

00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:51.390
and third-party integrations,
that enforcement

00:11:51.390 --> 00:11:54.130
would dramatically
accelerate the web.

00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:59.060
If you look at all the
opportunities that would be created,

00:11:59.060 --> 00:12:03.710
you know, even simple things for
folks who don't need accessibility,

00:12:03.710 --> 00:12:08.550
they don't realize how sometimes
there may be situations

00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:12.280
where if they were working
from an assessable site,

00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:14.430
their experience would
be dramatically improved.

00:12:14.430 --> 00:12:17.310
Maybe it's on a mobile
phone on a bright day

00:12:17.310 --> 00:12:24.510
and the contrast is actually
good enough, and it has

00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:27.590
maybe improved it, I should
say, by an accessible website,

00:12:27.590 --> 00:12:31.340
rather than on a site that's
all cluttered and garbagy,

00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:33.070
and then you still can't
utilize the experience.

00:12:33.070 --> 00:12:35.620
Obviously,
good tagging for everything improves

00:12:35.620 --> 00:12:36.700
search engine optimizations.

00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:40.130
It clarifies content.

00:12:40.130 --> 00:12:43.930
It helps create taxonomies of data.

00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:47.830
So, it's very exciting for me
the opportunities that exist,

00:12:47.830 --> 00:12:54.500
that exist for the cloud to
really accelerate adoption

00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:58.240
that's accessibility through
enforcement, front-end, back-end,

00:12:58.240 --> 00:12:59.240
and third-party.

00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:06.650
I hope that we can all start poking,
prodding, and really demanding

00:13:06.650 --> 00:13:11.030
at the end of the day that those
types of standards are ones

00:13:11.030 --> 00:13:16.310
that should be, you know,
the commonplace across the Internet,

00:13:16.310 --> 00:13:17.710
not an exception of the rule.

00:13:17.710 --> 00:13:23.170
We don't need bad sass,
bad hosting, bad social from

00:13:23.170 --> 00:13:24.250
and accessibility perspective.

00:13:24.250 --> 00:13:28.270
It only hinders communication
and at the end of the day,

00:13:28.270 --> 00:13:30.820
I find that accessibility
improvements

00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:32.590
are really communication
improvements.
