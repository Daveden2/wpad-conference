00:00:01.273 --> 00:00:04.600
 <v Amber Hinds> WordPress
Accessibility Day 2023.

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:08.560
Understanding Color and
Contrast Requirements in WCAG 2,

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:12.990
with speaker Jonathan Whiting,
Director of Training, WebAIM.

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.790
Recorded on September 28th, 2023.

00:00:19.224 --> 00:00:19.790
<v Jason Ferreira> All right.

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:20.940
We're at the top of the hour.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.090
Welcome, everyone who is
new here for this session;

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.260
or if you've been
here, welcome back.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:34.210
This is WordPress
Accessibility Day 2023.

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:36.380
My name is Jason Ferreira.

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:39.990
In my day job, I'm the accessibility
lead for consumer products

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:44.090
at Dow Jones, but for
today, I will be your host.

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.380
Thank you all for joining
us for Understanding Color

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:51.030
and Contrast Requirements in WCAG
2, with Jonathan Whiting.

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.170
A little background on Jon.

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.820
Jon is the Director
of Training at WebAIM.

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.180
His main passion is
helping others learn

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.980
to make the web more accessible
to people with disabilities.

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:04.239
With a master's degree

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:06.700
in Instructional
Technology, and 20 years

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.170
of experience in the field
of web accessibility,

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.090
Jonathan has published dozens
of articles, tutorials,

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:15.890
and other instructional resources.

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.490
He has traveled extensively to
train thousands of web developers,

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.640
and other professionals who
develop or maintain web content.

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.740
Before I pass it over to you,
Jon, one last bit of housekeeping.

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.480
Attendees, please feel
free to add your questions

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.900
in the Zoom Q&A section,
and we will answer them at the end

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.590
of today's session.

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.120
Please use the chat to
connect with other attendees,

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:42.290
to chat amongst yourselves,
and use the Q&A for any questions

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:45.760
that you would like Jon to
address at the end here.

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.050
Without further ado, I will
turn it over to you, Jonathan,

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:49.160
and we will get started.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:52.390
 <v Jonathan Whiting> Great.

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:54.150
Thank you, Jason,
for your intro, I'm going

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:55.550
to get my screen share going here.

00:02:04.386 --> 00:02:06.079
Thank you so much for that intro.

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.759
I am just going to dive right in

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.370
because we've got a
lot to talk about it.

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:12.420
I do not know what I was
thinking trying to cover all this

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.210
in 40 minutes, but I am
going do the best that I can.

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:21.640
Just at the start, actually,
Jacqueline just put a link in chat

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.130
for a page with resources
that are related to this.

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.220
Now, I am not going to
be sharing the slides,

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.370
and this might make more
sense as we go through.

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.080
These are not really
slides for sharing.

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.360
There's a lot of accessibility
issues that need to be explained

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:34.760
and talked through.

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.080
But what I do want to share is a
page with several related resources.

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:44.960
So just articles on how to
make content more accessible,

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.620
articles on really what we are
going to talk about, and some tools

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:48.840
that we are going
to be using as well.

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.700
I think this will be kind of a more
useful page to refer to afterwards,

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.080
as opposed to my slides that
are really just talking points

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:57.190
and a lot of visuals.

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.620
I just want to start by
saying, at a very high level,

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.290
we are going to talk about,
primarily, two principles.

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.270
I am going to talk about just
making sure you've got good contrast

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:11.360
in the things that you create; I
will talk more about what I mean

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:12.090
by that.

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.050
And not relying on color.

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:17.930
So these are the two main principles
that we are going to talk about.

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.570
And to talk about all of
that, I am going to try to,

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:23.060
for the most part,
stick to a single example.

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:25.120
So I have got a question,
and feel free to type into chat.

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.800
I am going to just
describe it a little bit.

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:30.760
We have got a checkbox.

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.450
It is a custom checkbox.

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:34.350
I have got a label
with a link in it.

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.910
So the labels, I've read and
agreed to the terms of use.

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:39.040
The terms of use is the link.

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:40.680
It's not underlined.

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.870
And so just maybe any
guesses how many color

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:47.330
and contrast checks you would
have for this example right here,

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:49.440
if you were to evaluate
this on one of your pages.

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.120
OK, good.

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.560
So we got three, five.

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.480
This is great.

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:00.750
I really appreciate this.

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:05.590
I'll give just another second
for a couple more guesses.

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:06.220
Excellent.

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:08.510
There’s three, four, perfect, OK.

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:10.150
That is just about the average.

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.760
Most people do say three to five.

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.610
The reality is it’s 15 or more.

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:17.230
And you are, like, Wait, what?

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:19.580
Really 15 or more?
And I'll explain why that is.

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:20.910
But yes, there is a lot.

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:22.070
There's a lot of checks.

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:24.360
A lot of times when I'm
evaluating a page...

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:25.870
And that's part of the work I do.

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:27.940
I, primarily at WebAIM,
I focus on training,

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:29.880
but I do evaluation work as well.

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:33.060
And there are oftentimes
where I spend almost half

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:37.410
of my evaluation time just
cataloging issues related to color

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:38.470
and contrast.

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:41.220
So there is a link in that
resource page to a blog post

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:42.930
that enumerates those 15.

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:45.420
We are actually going to go
beyond that, time permitting,

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:46.780
to talk about why.

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:49.790
And why that number so high will
make sense, hopefully, pretty soon.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.560
I am not going to
talk too much about

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:58.250
the Web Content Accessibility
Guidelines as a set of guidelines.

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:02.380
Just within the guidelines,
there are these numbered requirements

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:04.400
called Success Criterion.

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.400
And there are a few that
I am going to talk about;

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:09.950
three in some detail, and I can
briefly touch on a fourth one.

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:12.890
Now I am going to start with the
requirement related to contrast.

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:13.860
Now there are levels.

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:16.810
If you are familiar with the
success criteria, they have levels

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:19.670
of single, double,
or triple A assigned to them.

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:21.396
So this first one
with minimum contrast

00:05:21.397 --> 00:05:22.820
is a level double-A requirement.

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:27.700
Just a little bit
about that requirement.

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:30.400
There is a phrase
that gets used a lot,

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.030
and it is not even
an incorrect phrase.

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:34.310
People talk about color contrast.

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:38.640
And it is true, color is an aspect
of contrast as we perceive it.

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:44.060
Different color combinations can
impact just the perceived contrast

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:44.630
of colors.

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:46.260
Some things are more legible.

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.910
Invert them, and maybe one or the
other is going to be more legible

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:50.680
for you.

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:53.880
However, the reality
is in these guidelines,

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:55.950
in the Web Content
Accessibility Guidelines,

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:02.570
they actually do not talk
about color contrast.

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:06.030
What they talk about in
WCAG is luminance contrast.

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:08.310
And what that means is it's not
about the colors you choose;

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:13.190
it's about the brightness
difference between these colors.

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:15.260
The full term that's
used in these guidelines

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.320
is Relative Luminance Contrast.

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:18.360
So what does that mean?

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:20.950
What it means is,
the way our screens work,

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:23.540
we’re really seeing three colors.

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:27.030
You got black, and then you got
three colors that are presented red,

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:28.510
green, and blue.

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:30.139
And pure red is pretty hard to read

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:32.000
when it is used on
a white background.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.460
Pure green is also
pretty hard to read.

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:37.280
Maybe even brighter and
harder to read than the blue.

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:39.060
I have actually added
a little outline.

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:42.430
It's just, I am trying to
make my inaccessible visuals

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:46.900
a bit more accessible with a few
little techniques here and there.

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:50.710
But that red and green is
just kind of hard to see.

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:53.823
And so what is found
within these guidelines

00:06:53.824 --> 00:06:57.630
is a fairly complex formula to try
to weigh these different colors.

00:06:57.630 --> 00:06:59.560
Don’t worry about the formula;
it's just a slide to say,

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:03.040
Look at all this math is
pretty much what's going on.

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:05.520
But what it does is it
weighs the red and the green

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:08.970
and the blue that are used and just
kind of looks at the brightness

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:12.710
of those, and creates a
ratio between two colors.

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:18.060
Now, the highest this ratio can be is
21-to-1, and that's black and white.

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:20.570
It does not matter if it's black
on white or white on black,

00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:26.220
it's that same ratio, and that's
the case with all of this.

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:29.070
If you swap those colors,
the ratio is still the same.

00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:35.650
Now, this is a lot of contrast,
and the highest isn't always best.

00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:38.060
A lot of black and white
can be kind of jarring.

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:43.390
So what is within WCAG within
these guidelines is a minimum level

00:07:43.390 --> 00:07:44.390
of contrast.

00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:48.580
And it's 4.5 to one
according to that formula.

00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:51.520
So the first couple checks that
you're going to have to do,

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:56.900
one is for that main text of I
have read and agreed to the...

00:07:56.900 --> 00:08:01.560
So the not link part of
it, just that label text.

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:05.460
And that would need 4.5 to 1
contrast with its background,

00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:07.570
which in this case is
a white background.

00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:11.300
The second check is going
to be the link text.

00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:18.160
So that also needs 4.5 to 1
contrast with its background.

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:19.370
Again,
we have got a lot to talk about.

00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:22.850
I am going to really demo
some things fairly quickly.

00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:24.709
But I am going to
talk about a few tools

00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:26.250
to help with testing of contrast.

00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:29.040
Now, there are a lot of great
contrast tools out there,

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:31.460
but I'm going to talk about the
ones that we have at WebAIM.

00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:32.500
They are available for free.

00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:35.800
But I'm going to point out
a couple of WebAIM tools,

00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:40.350
and the first one is going
to be a tool called WAVE.

00:08:40.350 --> 00:08:42.680
WAVE is a free evaluation tool.

00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:46.360
It's available at Wave.webaim.org,
and there is a link to that

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:49.980
within the evaluation
tools section.

00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:53.930
I am going to show what
WAVE does in just a second.

00:08:53.930 --> 00:08:56.900
But we also have browser
extensions that allows you

00:08:56.900 --> 00:09:00.480
to install this evaluation tool
on Chrome, Firefox, and Edge.

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:03.230
So that's what I'm going to use.

00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:08.960
When I demonstrate this,
I'm going to come to this color

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:12.740
and contrast practice
link in this page.

00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:16.950
I'm going to make sure to put this
back at its normal default size,

00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:18.120
and then I'm going to use WAVE.

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:21.740
Now because I have got
this add-on Installed,

00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:25.570
and I have this little WAVE,
W icon in the upper-right corner

00:09:25.570 --> 00:09:28.150
of my browser window here,
so I'm going to use that.

00:09:29.470 --> 00:09:32.910
WAVE gives me a lot of information
about a lot of accessibility things,

00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:37.820
errors, alerts, features, just things
that it wants me to be aware of

00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:40.350
and test a little bit more deeply.

00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:42.850
But don’t have time to
talk about most of WAVE.

00:09:42.850 --> 00:09:45.510
I'm just going to focus on
one thing that it will do,

00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:47.830
and that is it will
report contrast errors.

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:56.360
In this Wave sidebar,
I can click on the contrast tab,

00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:59.320
and there are a couple of these
icons telling me there's some text

00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:00.840
with very low contrast.

00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:05.460
There is this grand white that
has just under 4.7 to one.

00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:10.470
There’s also this button text,
like a gray on lighter gray button,

00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:12.760
also with low contrast.

00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:17.160
Now, this text in the middle
between these two icons, which is,

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:19.100
is this larger text to
have enough contrast.

00:10:20.170 --> 00:10:28.170
It actually has the same level of
contrast, but it does not show up.

00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:38.950
So the reason it does not
show up with an icon is

00:10:38.950 --> 00:10:40.950
because there is one
other rule to be aware of.

00:10:40.950 --> 00:10:42.050
Let me say it a little differently.

00:10:42.050 --> 00:10:43.690
There is no error.

00:10:43.690 --> 00:10:47.040
Same color; but this larger
text, no error icon.

00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:53.180
It's because there is one other
rule to be aware of in WCAG,

00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:56.610
and that is contrast of large text.

00:10:56.610 --> 00:10:59.780
So if you do have text that's
a certain size or larger,

00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:01.900
the requirement goes down.

00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:06.270
It goes down from 4.5-to-1
contrast down to three to one.

00:11:06.270 --> 00:11:07.930
So it’s bigger on screen.

00:11:07.930 --> 00:11:08.950
You just have more of it to read.

00:11:08.950 --> 00:11:12.180
It doesn't need as much
contrast to be perceivable.

00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:17.490
So the requirement for that 3-to-1,
that starts at 18-point text.

00:11:17.490 --> 00:11:20.820
Now in pixels, on the web,
that's going to be 24 pixels.

00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:26.230
If that text is bold, 14 point
or 18 and two-thirds pixels.

00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:28.410
That's that 3-to-1
contrast requirement.

00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:35.120
That’s why using
this tool in WAVE...

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:37.540
And there's some other
tools we will talk about.

00:11:37.540 --> 00:11:40.520
That’s why there is no error here,
because even though this text

00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:46.270
has the same color,
because it's large enough, it meets

00:11:46.270 --> 00:11:48.500
at least 3-to-1 contrast requirement,
so it's not a WCAG failure.

00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:50.080
And Wave does detect that.

00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:53.780
It looks at the size and
weight of the text to do this.

00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:55.610
Although it's not going
to detect everything.

00:11:55.610 --> 00:11:58.540
For example, I do have some text
that's on a gradient background.

00:11:58.540 --> 00:12:00.340
So there’s this is image.

00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:01.970
It's a background image as
well, I think.

00:12:01.970 --> 00:12:02.740
I can’t remember.

00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:04.360
I think I used a
background image here.

00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:09.510
Or maybe it's just a color gradient,
but still WAVE is not that smart.

00:12:09.510 --> 00:12:13.190
And so then we will talk about
some other ways to test contrast,

00:12:13.190 --> 00:12:15.810
but those are those
first couple of checks.

00:12:15.810 --> 00:12:18.770
Going to be the label text
and then that link text.

00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:24.350
OK, so that's one and two.

00:12:24.350 --> 00:12:28.320
Number three has to do
with non-text contrast.

00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:32.670
So there's a requirement;
the number is 1.4.11.

00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:36.650
But this requirement called
non-text contrast, also level AA,

00:12:36.650 --> 00:12:43.510
deals with things
that are not text.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.640
In this case, because this
is a custom check box... Now,

00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:55.130
if I'd stuck with the built-in native
kind of browser-built check box,

00:12:55.130 --> 00:12:58.220
no customization,
I would not need to check this.

00:12:58.220 --> 00:13:01.120
But because this is a custom
check box, I would also need

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:07.620
to check to see that the check
box has at least 3-to-1 contrast.

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:08.930
Now, what parts of the check box?

00:13:08.930 --> 00:13:11.720
Right now we're focusing on that
border, because that's the part

00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:15.630
that I need to be able to see
to know where I put my mouse

00:13:15.630 --> 00:13:17.530
or where I need to
navigate to the keyboard.

00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:23.490
Inside here, you can check
this thing, and so that needs

00:13:23.490 --> 00:13:25.050
to have at least 3-to-1 contrast.

00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:28.810
So that is the third
requirement here.

00:13:28.810 --> 00:13:32.010
And we’ll talk about a
couple other things related

00:13:32.010 --> 00:13:36.740
to non-text contrast later
on, but that’s three.

00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:44.110
I am going to just jump
onto this use of color,

00:13:44.110 --> 00:13:46.600
which is going to give me
my fourth check right now.

00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:50.330
So another requirement,
and the number for this is 1.4.1.

00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:53.160
And for keeping track,
it is level single A,

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:56.000
but this requirement
is called use of color.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.580
Now there's two important
things related to this.

00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:01.730
A lot of times what it comes to
mind when people talk about use

00:14:01.730 --> 00:14:05.640
of color is do not rely on color
like red and green for pass

00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:07.200
and fail and things like that.

00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:10.460
That's true, and we’re
going to come back to that.

00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:15.980
However, there is another important
way that color can be used.

00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:20.540
Sometimes it's requiring that someone
can distinguish a certain color.

00:14:20.540 --> 00:14:21.840
I can see red.

00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:23.260
I can see green.

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:27.130
But sometimes color is used
to distinguish an element

00:14:27.130 --> 00:14:30.160
to differentiate it
from something else.

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:32.960
And it's not so much the
color you’re are using;

00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:37.040
it’s the difference between colors
that's giving you information.

00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:38.930
A common example of this is a link.

00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:41.970
We have this link here
in the screenshot.

00:14:41.970 --> 00:14:45.690
And I have tried to add some
borders and a few things just to...

00:14:45.690 --> 00:14:50.760
I do not want my own slides
to have accessibility issues.

00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:53.120
I do not want to rely on
color in my own slides,

00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:55.970
so I tried to put an
order around this.

00:14:55.970 --> 00:15:01.770
But this terms of use,
because it's not underlined,

00:15:01.770 --> 00:15:05.220
because it's just a color difference,
that's being used to tell me

00:15:05.220 --> 00:15:06.230
that's a link.

00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:07.750
This would fail that requirement.

00:15:07.750 --> 00:15:09.780
One of the things it says
that you cannot do using

00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:11.900
just color is you
can not rely on color

00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:14.460
for distinguishing
a visual element.

00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:17.860
In other words, this isn't
body text; this is a link,

00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:19.850
and you can not rely on just
a color difference for that.

00:15:21.340 --> 00:15:24.770
I'm going to talk about that
requirement a little bit more,

00:15:24.770 --> 00:15:28.100
just focusing in on the
difference between this link text

00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:29.140
and the label text here.

00:15:30.370 --> 00:15:34.140
By the way,
these colors that I am going to use,

00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:37.110
these are colors that are
pulled exactly from, like,

00:15:37.110 --> 00:15:39.880
a Fortune 100 Company
that we worked with,

00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:42.120
and these are the colors they
were using for their links.

00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:47.020
This is the process we went through
talking about this with them.

00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:49.240
First of all,
you might think, Oh, no,

00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:51.080
those colors are pretty different.

00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:54.170
They are actually not.

00:15:54.170 --> 00:15:57.030
OK, the colors are different,
but the brightness difference

00:15:57.030 --> 00:16:00.050
between the two is
actually not a lot.

00:16:00.050 --> 00:16:03.900
The contrast difference,
they are almost the same.

00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:07.570
Some people do have difficulty
distinguishing gray and blue text.

00:16:07.570 --> 00:16:10.350
I've talked to a couple
people who told me that

00:16:10.350 --> 00:16:12.210
and shared that experience.

00:16:12.210 --> 00:16:16.340
And so if someone has difficulty
distinguishing gray and blue,

00:16:16.340 --> 00:16:21.740
this is a slide trying to
simulate what that might be like

00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:22.420
for that person.

00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:26.260
In terms of use, while very
slightly different, it's really hard

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:27.260
to distinguish that.

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:31.610
In fact, if you were just
reading through lines of text,

00:16:31.610 --> 00:16:34.740
even if you have good contrast
sensitivity, I think you're going

00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:36.170
to have a hard time
picking up the links.

00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:42.850
So that is just giving
you an idea of that issue.

00:16:42.850 --> 00:16:45.850
Now, when we were working
with this client, they said,

00:16:45.850 --> 00:16:47.410
Well, what if I just bold this?

00:16:47.410 --> 00:16:50.110
What if I use bold to
distinguish this link?

00:16:50.110 --> 00:16:51.800
And so let's see if I
were to pull out the color

00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:54.530
and just look at the
contrast difference there.

00:16:54.530 --> 00:16:57.870
That definitely does work.

00:16:57.870 --> 00:17:01.190
You now have distinguished your
links using more than just color.

00:17:02.450 --> 00:17:09.510
However, that only works if you only
use bold just for identifying links,

00:17:09.510 --> 00:17:11.170
and that's almost never the case.

00:17:11.170 --> 00:17:13.290
With this client, and a lot of
other people who we worked with

00:17:13.290 --> 00:17:17.470
on this issue, at some point
they use bold to emphasize text.

00:17:17.470 --> 00:17:20.680
So you might say, Well, I have read
and agreed to the terms of use,

00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:24.690
or, You must do this. Or it's
just, anywhere in that nearby text,

00:17:24.690 --> 00:17:27.380
you bold something to emphasize
it, well, now you are back

00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:31.550
to relying on color, and now you are
back to failing this requirement.

00:17:31.550 --> 00:17:39.550
So that’s a workaround that just
doesn't work most of the time.

00:17:41.450 --> 00:17:44.150
There’s a question that I know
has just popped up in Q&A.

00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:47.320
So does this meet this
criteria of colors used?

00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:50.400
And the link is underlined
when hovering a mouse over it.

00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:52.120
So I’m going to come to that.

00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:56.820
Before I do it, I just want to
say, let's underline our links.

00:17:56.820 --> 00:17:59.090
I think that's going
to be best practice.

00:17:59.090 --> 00:18:01.920
Not all links, not all the time,
but where they're appearing next

00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:04.800
to other non-linked
text, body text.

00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:08.570
It just make them better,
it makes them, I think, more usable,

00:18:08.570 --> 00:18:11.680
more mobile-friendly,
more scannable,

00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:15.410
easier to track a link across
line breaks, and things like that.

00:18:15.410 --> 00:18:17.570
So there's just a lot of good
reasons to underline your links.

00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:19.850
So what's required?

00:18:19.850 --> 00:18:23.990
And this actually, I think, goes to
the question that Beatrice asked,

00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:28.890
and that is, you've got not
just the contrast requirement,

00:18:28.890 --> 00:18:32.730
but what if the link is underlined
when hovering the mouse over it?

00:18:32.730 --> 00:18:36.800
So that on its own does
not meet this requirement,

00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:40.020
but it is a part of
meeting this requirement.

00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:46.160
So if you aren't underlining those
links, there are two requirements.

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:50.810
One is that there is a 3-to-1
contrast ratio between the link text

00:18:50.810 --> 00:18:53.170
and the non-link text.

00:18:53.170 --> 00:18:56.250
The idea with this is, if you give
it enough of a contrast difference,

00:18:56.250 --> 00:19:00.270
now you're not relying on someone
being able to differentiate colors;

00:19:00.270 --> 00:19:03.430
you are allowing them to just
differentiate the contrast,

00:19:03.430 --> 00:19:05.640
and just tell the difference
between, Well, this text is lighter

00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:08.420
or darker than this other text.

00:19:08.420 --> 00:19:11.800
And we’re are going to use a
tool in just a minute to show

00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:12.800
how you can do that.

00:19:13.790 --> 00:19:17.380
The second part to this,
though, is kind of related

00:19:17.380 --> 00:19:18.400
to what was just asked.

00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:21.820
The link must present a
change, a non-colored queue.

00:19:21.820 --> 00:19:23.870
So more than just a color change.

00:19:23.870 --> 00:19:25.880
And that typically
means bringing back

00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:29.380
that underline on keyboard focus.

00:19:29.380 --> 00:19:33.620
It actually isn't required for
mouse hover, because the idea

00:19:33.620 --> 00:19:35.650
with mouse hovers, is you're
already hovering with your mouse,

00:19:35.650 --> 00:19:37.930
and you already have
a pointer there.

00:19:37.930 --> 00:19:41.450
If it's a link... And this is,
by the way, just for links.

00:19:41.450 --> 00:19:43.410
It's not for buttons
or other things.

00:19:43.410 --> 00:19:46.430
This requirement, it just
specifically calls out links.

00:19:46.430 --> 00:19:53.250
It's kind of weird, but it does...
When you hover over link,

00:19:53.250 --> 00:19:54.620
you also get that cursor change.

00:19:54.620 --> 00:19:56.390
It changes to that finger.

00:19:56.390 --> 00:19:59.900
And so technically it's not required,
but it's a really, really good idea.

00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:03.180
If you are going to bring back
that underline, bring it back

00:20:03.180 --> 00:20:04.180
for the hover as well.

00:20:05.370 --> 00:20:08.160
So let's use this contrast checker.

00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:12.020
I'm going to go back to this page.

00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:13.870
Let me refresh this page.

00:20:13.870 --> 00:20:15.630
I'm actually going to
make it a bit larger.

00:20:15.630 --> 00:20:19.450
So we do have a link here,
kind of moving down this list.

00:20:19.450 --> 00:20:22.520
This I've read and agreed to...
And this time, it says copyright

00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:23.520
in terms of use.

00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:28.890
So these are the same colors
as was used in that slide.

00:20:28.890 --> 00:20:32.870
Now, if I want to test this,
I can use a link-contrast checker.

00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:42.490
This link contrast checker, what
it does is it adds another option.

00:20:42.490 --> 00:20:45.570
When I was using WAVE,
I had these two options for color.

00:20:45.570 --> 00:20:49.120
I had a slider for the text color
and a slider for the background,

00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:51.780
or options for the text
color and background color.

00:20:51.780 --> 00:20:56.270
This one has two different text
options: link and body text.

00:20:56.270 --> 00:21:01.220
So with link and body text,
I've pre-populated this

00:21:01.220 --> 00:21:03.170
with the two colors
that I've been using.

00:21:03.170 --> 00:21:07.440
So it's a blue that does
have at least 4.5 to one.

00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:09.930
You've got the body text that
also has at least 4.5 to one.

00:21:09.930 --> 00:21:12.726
So the link and body text pass

00:21:12.727 --> 00:21:16.920
on their own the text
contrast requirement.

00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:21.720
However, as I mentioned, they
have almost no contrast difference

00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:22.660
between them.

00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:25.150
So if I don't want to underline
my links, I am going to have

00:21:25.150 --> 00:21:26.690
to use a different color.

00:21:26.690 --> 00:21:32.100
Now I can not really go lighter
because if I go lighter very quickly,

00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:35.820
before I meet that three to
one difference between link

00:21:35.820 --> 00:21:41.380
and body text, very quickly,
I will get too low of contrast text.

00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:44.120
So in order to have 3-to-1
difference between the blue and gray,

00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:48.720
I have got to get that so light that
it only has 1.5 to one contrast.

00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:56.670
So the way I did that using this
link contrast checker, by the way,

00:21:56.670 --> 00:22:01.320
and other contrast checkers is
that there is a lightness slider,

00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:04.540
and that just tries to change
the lightness and darkness

00:22:04.540 --> 00:22:07.530
of that same keyword color.

00:22:07.530 --> 00:22:08.530
So that's not going to work.

00:22:09.410 --> 00:22:11.590
Neither is going
lighter with the gray.

00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:14.030
What you need to do is go
darker with one of those colors.

00:22:14.030 --> 00:22:17.300
I think it probably makes the most
sense to go darker with that gray.

00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:20.130
Otherwise, it basically looks like
you've got black links, you know,

00:22:20.130 --> 00:22:22.090
by the time it's dark enough.

00:22:22.090 --> 00:22:26.800
So dark gray text with that
same color blue for the links,

00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:29.210
this would now meet
that requirement.

00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:32.210
And that's something that I can do.

00:22:32.210 --> 00:22:34.170
I'm keeping Q&A open.

00:22:34.170 --> 00:22:36.230
I'm going to try to answer
some questions as I go,

00:22:36.230 --> 00:22:39.560
and hopefully still keep a
couple minutes at the end.

00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:42.180
There was a question about
adding an ARIA label.

00:22:42.180 --> 00:22:44.530
And I'm going to lump
that all into one category

00:22:44.530 --> 00:22:48.250
of making this accessible
for screen readers.

00:22:48.250 --> 00:22:53.580
And this is not about a blind
users or screen-reader users;

00:22:53.580 --> 00:22:56.150
this is about sighted users.

00:22:56.150 --> 00:22:58.550
So the thing with the
ARIA label is that

00:22:58.550 --> 00:23:01.240
and maybe some other
techniques might help me

00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:03.050
if I'm using a screen reader.

00:23:03.050 --> 00:23:05.039
But a screen reader is
actually already going

00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:06.120
to tell me it's a label.

00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:08.270
So this is purely a visual thing.

00:23:08.270 --> 00:23:11.040
This is really just about
differentiating colors.

00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:13.390
And so the ARIA in this case,
you're not going to be able

00:23:13.390 --> 00:23:16.130
to add anything with ARIA
labels or anything else

00:23:16.131 --> 00:23:17.500
that would address this.

00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:19.650
It would really have to be at the
level of the colors you choose.

00:23:21.310 --> 00:23:23.760
Another question from Megan;
a really good question.

00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:28.310
And that is if there's different
requirements, the link is standalone.

00:23:28.310 --> 00:23:33.500
So you gave the example, Megan, in
your question, maybe of navigation.

00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:36.200
So on this page with the
link contrast checker,

00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:40.350
we do have some navigation links at
the top to the five main sections

00:23:40.350 --> 00:23:43.970
on the WebAIM site,
and they are not underlined,

00:23:43.970 --> 00:23:49.380
because they are clearly
presented as links.

00:23:49.380 --> 00:23:51.960
Again, this is about
the visual presentation.

00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:57.790
And if I can not perceive color, I am
still going to know those are links.

00:23:57.790 --> 00:24:04.130
Regardless of the color perception
or contrast sensitivity,

00:24:04.130 --> 00:24:05.760
I'm still going to be able to tell.

00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:07.510
So, yes, good question.

00:24:07.510 --> 00:24:10.340
That would not need
to be underlined.

00:24:10.340 --> 00:24:12.300
Or if there's other styling.

00:24:12.300 --> 00:24:14.820
Sometimes you got links
that look like buttons.

00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:17.600
They are links under the hood, and
you've made them look like buttons,

00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:19.420
and you no longer
have those underlined.

00:24:19.420 --> 00:24:20.910
That's another example
in the question.

00:24:20.910 --> 00:24:22.090
That's fine too.

00:24:22.090 --> 00:24:26.020
Really, this is about just not
relying on color as the only way

00:24:26.020 --> 00:24:27.020
to present that.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.160
So yes,
thank you for the questions.

00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:31.510
Keep those questions coming.

00:24:31.510 --> 00:24:34.870
Some I'll probably hold off and
answer at the end; but some,

00:24:34.870 --> 00:24:38.000
if it seems helpful to just
answer them while I'm going,

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:39.000
I'll do that instead.

00:24:40.730 --> 00:24:46.370
So hopefully that maybe helps
with how I could use this tool

00:24:46.370 --> 00:24:52.120
to get the necessary color,
or really contrast differences

00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:53.120
with these colors.

00:24:56.330 --> 00:24:59.220
All right.

00:25:00.330 --> 00:25:03.510
So here’s a slide showing
what that would be like.

00:25:03.510 --> 00:25:06.880
We got that much darker gray that's
getting a lot closer to black.

00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:09.700
And then we have got that
contrast that's going to give you

00:25:09.700 --> 00:25:11.140
what you need again.

00:25:11.140 --> 00:25:13.250
But if I underline it,
just look how much more obvious

00:25:13.250 --> 00:25:18.640
it is right off the bat
that that is a link.

00:25:20.210 --> 00:25:24.740
So that's just a little bit
more about kind of that idea

00:25:24.740 --> 00:25:32.050
of relying on color, and why it's
important to not just do that.

00:25:32.050 --> 00:25:33.800
OK, so we're only up to four.

00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:35.570
We're halfway through our time,
and we're only up to four,

00:25:35.570 --> 00:25:36.720
how's that possible?

00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:40.440
Well, the reason that's possible
is because numbers five to 15,

00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:43.170
most of them kind of fall
into the same category.

00:25:43.170 --> 00:25:45.360
And that is,
you got to interact with the thing.

00:25:46.570 --> 00:25:52.040
There are only a few things that
you can detect just at a glance

00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:53.600
or using tools like WAVE.

00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:56.550
A lot of it has to do with
the interaction that happens,

00:25:56.550 --> 00:25:59.777
because you need to consider
the contrast of things

00:25:59.778 --> 00:26:01.080
in different states.

00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:03.690
So if I have this custom
checkbox and I hover over it,

00:26:03.690 --> 00:26:08.020
and so it changes from gray to
blue... Or if I have a link,

00:26:08.020 --> 00:26:11.570
and when I hover over that link,
it gets lighter, as an example,

00:26:12.690 --> 00:26:16.710
now those are different states
where the contrast has changed,

00:26:16.710 --> 00:26:18.330
and I'm going to need to test that.

00:26:18.330 --> 00:26:20.370
So that's a lot of these.

00:26:20.370 --> 00:26:22.890
Five, six, seven, eight,
they are all different states

00:26:22.890 --> 00:26:24.450
of that checkbox border.

00:26:24.450 --> 00:26:26.800
Hover, focus, active, checked.

00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:29.780
Now some of these are
just super fast tests.

00:26:29.780 --> 00:26:33.090
If I'm hovering with my mouse
and something does not change,

00:26:33.090 --> 00:26:38.770
or it gets darker, well, I don't
need to dig deeper with that.

00:26:38.770 --> 00:26:40.800
I don't need to pull out
other tools or techniques.

00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:45.580
If it has enough contrast and it
gets darker on the background,

00:26:45.580 --> 00:26:47.990
it's going to have more contrast.

00:26:47.990 --> 00:26:51.220
So some of these are like one-second
checks, but it's important

00:26:51.220 --> 00:26:51.890
to do this.

00:26:51.890 --> 00:26:57.070
When I interact with this thing, when
I check it, when I follow a link,

00:26:57.070 --> 00:27:00.510
does it... You don't have as
many sites with this anymore,

00:27:00.510 --> 00:27:04.880
but if it has, like...
Sorry, transitioning to the links.

00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:08.290
Does it have, like,
a visited state, you know?

00:27:08.290 --> 00:27:10.510
It’s hover, focus, active, visited.

00:27:10.510 --> 00:27:11.750
So that's a bunch of these.

00:27:11.750 --> 00:27:15.187
Nine, ten, eleven,
twelve; hover, focus, active,

00:27:15.188 --> 00:27:16.940
and visited for my link.

00:27:18.060 --> 00:27:20.680
So that's how that number
gets so big so fast.

00:27:24.850 --> 00:27:27.550
OK, so there's a question in
the related resource section.

00:27:27.550 --> 00:27:30.420
Let me go back to this page
real quick, just to clarify.

00:27:30.420 --> 00:27:32.340
Really good question,
and good catch.

00:27:32.340 --> 00:27:35.630
I have like a few links in this
page, and only one

00:27:35.630 --> 00:27:39.740
of these examples is not underlined
specifically for this activity.

00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:42.970
There are some others
that are underlined.

00:27:42.970 --> 00:27:50.970
Leigh Ann, I'm actually not sure if
I'm totally following the question.

00:27:51.140 --> 00:27:57.590
So where it's clear that these
are links... Oh, I'm sorry,

00:27:57.590 --> 00:27:58.870
actually,
I know what you are saying.

00:27:58.870 --> 00:28:01.230
So we've got this
related resource section.

00:28:01.230 --> 00:28:04.880
So we've got a few things that are
very clearly presented as links.

00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:09.280
So how about the non-link
text for some of these though?

00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:13.330
For each of the articles,
I have added a few words to describe

00:28:13.330 --> 00:28:16.490
what that article contains,
and that's not a link.

00:28:16.490 --> 00:28:22.160
Now, if for example, my related
resources, it gets a lot closer,

00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:25.290
but I even, there, do have a
couple of separate links...

00:28:25.290 --> 00:28:28.590
So at the bottom, I've got a link to
the WordPress accessibility plugin,

00:28:28.590 --> 00:28:31.020
and that’s about the only thing
I'm going to say about WordPress

00:28:31.020 --> 00:28:33.200
in this WordPress
Accessibility day.

00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:37.070
But it's got a link and then
non-link, and then the name,

00:28:37.070 --> 00:28:38.270
and so it's two separate links.

00:28:38.270 --> 00:28:42.510
And so that's kind
of the idea there.

00:28:42.510 --> 00:28:45.150
Yes, thank you, Leigh Ann,
I finally tracked that question.

00:28:45.150 --> 00:28:46.600
That's a good question, thanks.

00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:52.370
So you would still need to,
in this case, underline those links.

00:28:52.370 --> 00:28:55.720
Now, there might be places
where that's not the case.

00:28:55.720 --> 00:28:58.000
For example, there might be
some pages where we have a list

00:28:58.000 --> 00:28:59.490
of related resources.

00:28:59.490 --> 00:29:04.290
They are always just links, and
they are called related resources.

00:29:04.290 --> 00:29:06.770
And you could maybe make a
case for not underlining those.

00:29:06.770 --> 00:29:09.820
And I'm talking about a sidebar
that we have in an article

00:29:09.820 --> 00:29:11.040
that I just clicked on.

00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:18.330
So yes, there might be times
where that's not needed.

00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:28.860
Got a question coming on.

00:29:28.860 --> 00:29:31.340
I'm going to hold off on
that one maybe till later.

00:29:32.570 --> 00:29:36.570
So 13 and 14, now we're going to
be talking about not just the color

00:29:36.570 --> 00:29:38.740
of something if it
changes color on focus,

00:29:38.740 --> 00:29:43.360
but whatever indication you have
that something has keyboard focus.

00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:48.370
So this focus indicator, I’ve
used to blue outline as an example

00:29:48.370 --> 00:29:50.770
where if I hit the tab key
and navigate to something

00:29:50.770 --> 00:29:53.840
with the keyboard,
there is outline.

00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:55.950
So that's going to be
number 13 for the link.

00:29:55.950 --> 00:29:58.030
Number 14 is going to
be for the checkbox.

00:30:01.220 --> 00:30:04.030
Oh, yes, Joe mentioned in the chat.

00:30:04.030 --> 00:30:08.210
A little plug for that, it does
have a contrast testing, I think,

00:30:08.210 --> 00:30:10.300
built into that plugin.

00:30:10.300 --> 00:30:11.980
And Joe, you can correct
me on that if I am wrong,

00:30:11.980 --> 00:30:15.500
but it is a useful WordPress
resource, absolutely.

00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:22.760
So a little bit more on focus.

00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:26.660
Of all of these different states,
it is by far the trickiest.

00:30:26.660 --> 00:30:29.480
Because the thing that
sets keyboard focus apart

00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:36.520
from all these other
possible states is

00:30:36.520 --> 00:30:41.500
that the change actually does
direct you to that thing.

00:30:41.500 --> 00:30:45.430
When I'm hitting the tab key,
that whatever change I get on focus,

00:30:45.430 --> 00:30:48.260
that's how I know
that thing has focus.

00:30:48.260 --> 00:30:50.700
With a mouse,
I know because my mouse is on it.

00:30:50.700 --> 00:30:52.306
I get a cursor, I get a finger,

00:30:52.307 --> 00:30:54.430
something to tell me
my mouse is on it.

00:30:54.430 --> 00:30:57.320
Well, with focus,
that is how I know.

00:30:57.320 --> 00:31:01.070
And so there's some additional
things to be aware of here.

00:31:01.070 --> 00:31:05.320
So if I just changed color
between these different states...

00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:10.400
I've got a gray default, a blue
hover, and a green focus border.

00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:12.130
Now, I'm not recommending
these colors.

00:31:12.130 --> 00:31:14.130
It’s just for examples.

00:31:14.130 --> 00:31:17.170
But if I were to do that,
the hover would be fine

00:31:17.170 --> 00:31:19.820
because there'd be a
3-to-1 difference here.

00:31:19.820 --> 00:31:22.540
The focus though,
there'd actually be a problem here.

00:31:23.700 --> 00:31:26.750
And it would probably
be a failure of WCAG.

00:31:26.750 --> 00:31:29.690
Now, it gets kind of
technical and tricky here.

00:31:29.690 --> 00:31:34.130
It's actually a failure of the
color requirement because I'm back

00:31:34.130 --> 00:31:35.840
to relying on color.

00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:39.470
I'm back to relying on color
for a place where, like,

00:31:39.470 --> 00:31:41.880
if I'm using a keyboard,
it's only a color difference

00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:44.880
that would tell me that I'm
navigated to that thing.

00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:49.550
So that's a requirement
that you need to address.

00:31:49.550 --> 00:31:53.360
Now, this is probably one of
the funkiest things that I want

00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:57.010
to talk about, and I hope I can
explain it with the time I've got.

00:31:57.010 --> 00:32:01.810
If you add, say, a little
light gray border to a checkbox

00:32:03.970 --> 00:32:07.500
between the hover and focus states...
So you've got gray default,

00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:11.580
blue hover, and then just this
light gray little glow on focus...

00:32:11.580 --> 00:32:17.140
It actually passes all of the
requirements in WCAG at levels A

00:32:17.140 --> 00:32:21.330
and double A, up to version 2.1,
which is the current version.

00:32:21.330 --> 00:32:24.290
There's kind of this weird
gap where in the contrast one,

00:32:24.290 --> 00:32:27.690
it says, well, you need at least
3-to-1 contrast for every state,

00:32:27.690 --> 00:32:30.860
but not differences between states.

00:32:30.860 --> 00:32:35.090
And in the color one, it says
you can’t rely on color alone,

00:32:35.090 --> 00:32:37.400
but it does not have
a minimum contrast.

00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:41.150
So there's this weird little gap
where this little subtle glow,

00:32:41.150 --> 00:32:44.160
even though it's very light and
has less than 3-to-1 contrast,

00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:47.490
would not fail anything
in version 2.1.

00:32:47.490 --> 00:32:49.560
So there is a version 2.2.

00:32:50.700 --> 00:32:53.360
And I've got the text here, but
actually, in the interest of time,

00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:54.680
I'm not going to read it all.

00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:56.430
It's called focus appearance.

00:32:56.430 --> 00:33:00.720
And what it basically says
is, it's not enough just to...

00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:02.010
It fills that gap.

00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:09.150
If I have the gray box as my
default, that blue box

00:33:09.150 --> 00:33:12.120
with the light gray glow
is my focus indication,

00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:14.600
that would fail this requirement.

00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:16.870
Because the difference
between these two,

00:33:16.870 --> 00:33:18.990
is it does not have
3-to-1 contrast.

00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:23.010
Another thing that would
fail is a very narrow border.

00:33:23.010 --> 00:33:26.980
So if I have just got like a one
or under a two pixel, say outline

00:33:26.980 --> 00:33:29.650
or something like that...
If it's really, really thin...

00:33:29.650 --> 00:33:34.230
I made it's slightly bigger than one
pixel just so you all can see it.

00:33:34.230 --> 00:33:38.170
But it would also fail just
because the indication is so small

00:33:38.170 --> 00:33:39.430
that it might be hard to perceive.

00:33:40.670 --> 00:33:43.934
Although,
if I did darken the checkbox,

00:33:43.935 --> 00:33:46.300
the checkbox is much darker,

00:33:46.300 --> 00:33:51.810
and now the color difference between
of the borders is at least 3-to-1,

00:33:51.810 --> 00:33:52.940
that would actually pass.

00:33:52.940 --> 00:33:55.920
Because now I've got this big
border, at least two pixels,

00:33:55.920 --> 00:33:59.480
and that border has at least
a 3-to-1 contrast difference.

00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:02.210
The glow, actually,
is no longer even relevant.

00:34:02.210 --> 00:34:05.860
It's just that it's big enough
and it's different enough

00:34:05.860 --> 00:34:07.650
that it would meet
this requirement.

00:34:07.650 --> 00:34:10.800
Now even better,
give it a focus outline.

00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:15.100
Almost always add that keyboard
focus outline because it works

00:34:15.100 --> 00:34:16.830
with all of your states.

00:34:16.830 --> 00:34:19.710
Sometimes you end up getting places
where you get more than one state

00:34:19.710 --> 00:34:21.480
at the same time.

00:34:22.590 --> 00:34:23.740
Now, this is kind
of a weird scenario,

00:34:23.740 --> 00:34:25.880
but maybe I've hovered over
something with my mouse

00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:27.740
while I'm tapping along with
my keyboard, I just kind

00:34:27.740 --> 00:34:29.020
of put my mouse over something.

00:34:31.030 --> 00:34:35.230
I've given that an outline, and
that outline is at least two pixels,

00:34:35.230 --> 00:34:38.320
and that outline has at least
3-to-1 contrast with the background,

00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:40.450
then I've met all of
these requirements.

00:34:40.450 --> 00:34:42.120
And so that's going to
be best most of the time.

00:34:43.700 --> 00:34:47.280
OK, a little water break.

00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:55.780
So if we've got to evaluate all
these states, and if it's two-thirds

00:34:55.780 --> 00:34:58.540
of the things that I've talked
about in terms of numbers,

00:34:59.610 --> 00:35:01.760
how can I do that?

00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:04.810
Well there's several
ways that I can do this,

00:35:04.810 --> 00:35:08.390
but one is using DevTools
or Chrome Developer Tools.

00:35:08.390 --> 00:35:11.550
There are similar contrast tools
in other browsers, but I'm going

00:35:11.550 --> 00:35:14.680
to focus in on Chrome and
their developer tools.

00:35:14.680 --> 00:35:16.960
There's an article that goes
through this, so I'm going

00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:18.590
to go fairly quickly.

00:35:18.590 --> 00:35:21.140
But if you want to learn
more about how to do this,

00:35:21.140 --> 00:35:25.220
just please go back to the article
that's linked to that resource page.

00:35:25.220 --> 00:35:29.700
So I've got a scenario here now
where there's a contact us link.

00:35:29.700 --> 00:35:32.260
And when I come to this contact
us link and I hover over it

00:35:32.260 --> 00:35:35.040
with a mouse, or if I navigate
to it with a keyboard...

00:35:36.350 --> 00:35:39.080
In this case,
it's just the hover state.

00:35:39.080 --> 00:35:40.000
I misspoke.

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:41.000
It gets lighter.

00:35:42.350 --> 00:35:47.420
So that lighter text, I don’t
know if that has enough contrast.

00:35:47.420 --> 00:35:50.160
So with DevTools, there's
some cool stuff that I can do.

00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:53.340
Just to save time, keyboard
shortcut that I use all the time

00:35:53.340 --> 00:35:58.510
is Control-Shift C on Windows and
Command-Shift or Command-Option.

00:35:58.510 --> 00:36:00.190
I think, maybe even both.

00:36:00.190 --> 00:36:03.120
But I think it's
Command-Shift C on Mac,

00:36:03.120 --> 00:36:05.110
and it will open
this Developer Tools,

00:36:05.110 --> 00:36:07.800
and it will also open
this mouse inspector.

00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:10.330
Now, this tool is mouse
only, but what I can do is

00:36:10.330 --> 00:36:12.450
I can hover over
different elements.

00:36:12.450 --> 00:36:15.080
One thing it'll do is it'll
actually tell me the contrast,

00:36:15.080 --> 00:36:18.430
which in this case is 4.8 to 1.

00:36:18.430 --> 00:36:22.430
So it's over that 4.5 to 1
requirement in its default state.

00:36:22.430 --> 00:36:27.340
Now, if I wanted to test that hover
state, in this Developer Tools,

00:36:27.340 --> 00:36:30.170
kind of the bottom half,
I've got these different tabs.

00:36:30.170 --> 00:36:32.860
The first one that's selected
by default is styles.

00:36:33.960 --> 00:36:36.900
Right under that styles
tab is this button.

00:36:36.900 --> 00:36:39.150
HOB is what the button says.

00:36:39.150 --> 00:36:41.870
It's called ToggleElementState.

00:36:41.870 --> 00:36:44.590
And if I come into this
ToggleElementState, I expand it

00:36:44.590 --> 00:36:48.120
by clicking on the button,
and I check the hover state,

00:36:48.120 --> 00:36:50.690
it actually will lighten this text.

00:36:50.690 --> 00:36:51.770
I should have lightened the text.

00:36:51.770 --> 00:36:52.210
You know what?

00:36:52.210 --> 00:36:53.340
I didn't inspect the right thing.

00:36:53.340 --> 00:36:54.460
Let me do that one more time.

00:36:54.460 --> 00:36:55.880
Got to make sure I'm
on the right thing.

00:36:55.880 --> 00:36:57.080
I'm on that link.

00:36:57.080 --> 00:36:59.820
You are going to toggle
that hover state.

00:36:59.820 --> 00:37:04.690
And now if I inspect this,
it has 3-to-1 contrast,

00:37:04.690 --> 00:37:06.440
and it fails this requirement.

00:37:06.440 --> 00:37:10.890
And so Developer Tools can be really
useful to lock in these states

00:37:10.890 --> 00:37:12.590
when I know I need to do
a little more testing.

00:37:15.180 --> 00:37:17.570
I know we're kind of
flying through these.

00:37:18.610 --> 00:37:21.370
Sometimes I'll take about
three hours on these topics.

00:37:21.370 --> 00:37:23.600
Going kind of quickly,
but, again, hopefully

00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:27.470
just the principles make some
sense, and then dig a little deeper

00:37:27.470 --> 00:37:28.590
with some of those articles.

00:37:29.890 --> 00:37:33.740
OK, so number 15 is actually
an easy one to overlook.

00:37:33.740 --> 00:37:35.690
But that is, Well, what about
the check mark? So actually,

00:37:35.690 --> 00:37:37.740
it's in this checked state.

00:37:37.740 --> 00:37:40.590
I mean, what is the indication that
this thing is actually checked?

00:37:40.590 --> 00:37:41.440
A check mark?

00:37:41.440 --> 00:37:44.100
I've got to test the contrast
of that and make sure

00:37:44.100 --> 00:37:46.900
that thing has contrast as well.

00:37:46.900 --> 00:37:48.180
So I'm up to my 15.

00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:51.690
But wait, there's more.

00:37:51.690 --> 00:37:55.150
There's actually more than these
15, because if I look at this thing,

00:37:55.150 --> 00:37:57.670
I have read and agreed to
the terms of use, basically,

00:37:57.670 --> 00:38:01.480
every time this appears or something
like this appears in a form,

00:38:01.480 --> 00:38:02.480
it is required.

00:38:03.350 --> 00:38:05.970
And so if you have something
that's required, what are you going

00:38:05.970 --> 00:38:06.460
to end up with?

00:38:06.460 --> 00:38:09.600
You are going to end up with
error messaging submission

00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:12.040
of that thing, error
states, that kind of stuff.

00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:17.400
So this is the bonus around,
the lightning round here,

00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:19.670
where it gets faster.

00:38:19.670 --> 00:38:24.580
But this is going to be a
little bit more than those 15.

00:38:24.580 --> 00:38:30.160
What if this thing has an error?
So I've read and agreed

00:38:30.160 --> 00:38:32.220
to the terms of use,
and there's this submit button,

00:38:32.220 --> 00:38:34.760
but it has really low contrast.

00:38:34.760 --> 00:38:39.510
That's a visual indication that
this thing is disabled or inactive,

00:38:39.510 --> 00:38:41.250
and I can’t click on it.

00:38:41.250 --> 00:38:43.420
So I might try to click on it
and nothing's going to happen.

00:38:43.420 --> 00:38:45.080
If I try to navigate with
the keyboard, it's going

00:38:45.080 --> 00:38:49.010
to jump past that thing because
it can’t get keyboard focus

00:38:49.010 --> 00:38:50.620
while it's in that disabled state.

00:38:52.540 --> 00:38:54.460
So you might think, Well,
what do I do about that?

00:38:54.460 --> 00:38:57.880
That fails, right?
It actually does not fail

00:38:57.880 --> 00:39:01.110
because there is an exception
for inactive components,

00:39:01.110 --> 00:39:03.180
because the way you know
something is inactive

00:39:03.180 --> 00:39:05.800
or disabled is that
it's low contrast.

00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:10.290
But this is not an
ideal way to do this.

00:39:11.360 --> 00:39:14.200
I'm sure all of us have had this
situation where we were, like,

00:39:14.200 --> 00:39:15.690
Why can't I submit this thing?

00:39:15.690 --> 00:39:17.630
Why can't I click this button?
And then you realize,

00:39:17.630 --> 00:39:20.600
Oh, I missed some required things
somewhere else up the form.

00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:22.540
I did not even realize
it was required.

00:39:22.540 --> 00:39:26.170
I think it’s better to
usually allow submission,

00:39:26.170 --> 00:39:30.080
and then provide error
feedback, error messaging.

00:39:30.080 --> 00:39:31.720
So we got this button.

00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:35.550
The submit button is
no longer disabled.

00:39:35.550 --> 00:39:38.920
So I'm going to click it and I
will get some error messages.

00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:40.500
So now I need to test that.

00:39:40.500 --> 00:39:43.250
So number 16 is going to be
contrast of the button border.

00:39:43.250 --> 00:39:44.710
[Inaudible 00:39:43]

00:39:44.710 --> 00:39:47.290
leading way... Actually not.

00:39:47.290 --> 00:39:49.460
Because the idea with... Why not?

00:39:49.460 --> 00:39:52.700
I said I needed the border with the
checkbox, but not with the button.

00:39:52.700 --> 00:39:55.580
Well, that's because with
the checkbox, I need to know

00:39:55.580 --> 00:39:58.830
that my mouse goes inside that box.

00:39:58.830 --> 00:40:02.120
That's the border of the thing
that I can check with a button.

00:40:03.620 --> 00:40:07.920
So you do not actually have a
contrast requirement for that border.

00:40:07.920 --> 00:40:10.080
So how about the
fill of that button?

00:40:10.080 --> 00:40:13.210
Actually, not even the fill.

00:40:15.510 --> 00:40:21.810
The fill with the background,
does that meet at least 3-to-1

00:40:21.810 --> 00:40:23.460
or something like that?

00:40:23.460 --> 00:40:25.270
It does not.

00:40:25.270 --> 00:40:27.760
The idea with that is,
we've all seen buttons

00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:31.310
that do not have a background at all
and we still know where to click.

00:40:32.880 --> 00:40:36.830
Now submit usually looks like
a button, but sometimes it

00:40:36.830 --> 00:40:38.170
might be a different color.

00:40:38.170 --> 00:40:42.000
Or you might have a
reset button or something

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:44.250
that does not look like a button.

00:40:44.250 --> 00:40:46.370
So what do I need to really test?

00:40:46.370 --> 00:40:47.840
Well, the contrast
of the button text.

00:40:47.840 --> 00:40:51.800
So that would be this dark gray
text on this light blue background.

00:40:51.800 --> 00:40:55.060
That would be the contrast
that I would need to test.

00:40:55.060 --> 00:40:57.530
I'm actually thinking, well,
you are kind of stretching

00:40:57.530 --> 00:40:58.640
for some of these numbers.

00:40:58.640 --> 00:41:00.630
I'm actually going to
walk you back here.

00:41:00.630 --> 00:41:02.790
And I'm just going
to leave it at 16.

00:41:02.790 --> 00:41:05.830
But you actually would need to
test all the other possible states

00:41:05.830 --> 00:41:07.320
of this button as well.

00:41:07.320 --> 00:41:09.780
So it's actually going to be
16-plus, closer to 20.

00:41:11.020 --> 00:41:13.110
So let's say I submit this
thing and I've got an error.

00:41:14.120 --> 00:41:22.110
And so now with this error,
I've got a checkbox that's now red.

00:41:22.110 --> 00:41:24.340
So a couple of things
with this red checkbox.

00:41:24.340 --> 00:41:27.490
One is that I now need to test
the contrast of this thing.

00:41:27.490 --> 00:41:30.240
So does it have at least 3-to-1
contrast at the background

00:41:30.240 --> 00:41:31.890
in its error state?

00:41:31.890 --> 00:41:35.800
I've introduced an additional state
now that this thing has an error.

00:41:37.260 --> 00:41:39.010
So that's 17.

00:41:40.780 --> 00:41:44.510
Then what about the difference
between the error state

00:41:44.510 --> 00:41:46.230
and the focus state?

00:41:46.230 --> 00:41:50.310
So before saying, OK, we got that
black or really dark checkbox,

00:41:50.310 --> 00:41:52.470
got this bright blue
focus indicator.

00:41:52.470 --> 00:41:56.510
I'm good to go, right?
Well, what if there's an error?

00:41:56.510 --> 00:42:01.970
The difference you're looking
for is between the unfocused

00:42:01.970 --> 00:42:04.060
and the focused
state of that thing.

00:42:04.060 --> 00:42:07.750
And when it's got an error,
the unfocused state is now red.

00:42:07.750 --> 00:42:11.000
And so I failed again, unless I
would have added maybe that...

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:14.280
That’s another reason,
another plug for adding that outline.

00:42:15.550 --> 00:42:18.130
So that's that one.

00:42:18.130 --> 00:42:20.154
Probably the big one
here is you've got color

00:42:20.155 --> 00:42:21.430
that's prompting a response.

00:42:22.470 --> 00:42:26.450
So with this color prompting a
response, that's going to be a use

00:42:26.450 --> 00:42:27.730
of color failure.

00:42:27.730 --> 00:42:29.260
And you might say, Well,
wait, I thought I had

00:42:29.260 --> 00:42:33.660
at least 3-to-1 contrast like the
link text. Well, this is different.

00:42:33.660 --> 00:42:36.240
The reason this is different is
because you're not just saying,

00:42:36.240 --> 00:42:37.670
here's a color difference.

00:42:37.670 --> 00:42:42.020
You're actually using the
color red to convey meaning.

00:42:42.020 --> 00:42:46.220
This requires that I can detect
and differentiate the color red

00:42:46.220 --> 00:42:48.430
from all other colors.

00:42:48.430 --> 00:42:50.561
And so even if this
has enough contrast,

00:42:50.562 --> 00:42:52.120
this would still be a failure

00:42:52.120 --> 00:42:58.290
of that use of color requirement
because I got to be able to see red

00:42:58.290 --> 00:42:59.490
and tell it apart from others.

00:43:00.970 --> 00:43:01.790
So what would I want to do?

00:43:01.790 --> 00:43:05.810
Maybe I'd want to add an icon
and some kind of an alert

00:43:05.810 --> 00:43:09.840
in addition to that color to let
me know that there's an error,

00:43:09.840 --> 00:43:10.840
and that's great.

00:43:11.790 --> 00:43:16.870
Now, this would be something that I'd
also need to test the contrast of.

00:43:16.870 --> 00:43:19.370
So one little aside
here with this contrast,

00:43:20.400 --> 00:43:26.080
and that is I've used a white
background for all of these slides.

00:43:26.080 --> 00:43:29.720
Often, I'll see a form, for example,
or maybe even like this bottom part

00:43:29.720 --> 00:43:31.190
of the form where it's
like a lighter gray.

00:43:32.430 --> 00:43:36.500
When it comes to testing
contrast of shapes,

00:43:36.500 --> 00:43:39.830
it's not always just two colors.

00:43:39.830 --> 00:43:43.880
The term that's used in WCAG to
describe the contrast requirements is

00:43:43.880 --> 00:43:46.640
that it's against adjacent colors.

00:43:46.640 --> 00:43:50.150
The parts of the shape
that I need to perceive

00:43:50.150 --> 00:43:51.780
in order to know what's going on.

00:43:51.780 --> 00:43:55.850
And for an alert icon specifically,
a triangle is part of that shape.

00:43:55.850 --> 00:43:59.960
Now, if it were a circle or a square
or just an exclamation mark, fine.

00:43:59.960 --> 00:44:03.250
But because I've decided to use
a triangle, and that is a symbol

00:44:03.250 --> 00:44:09.380
for an alert, now I’d have to
test really the white contrast

00:44:09.380 --> 00:44:10.860
from the red.

00:44:10.860 --> 00:44:15.080
And if that has at least 3-to-1, I'm
good, which, in this case, it does.

00:44:15.080 --> 00:44:18.690
But the red against the
gray background does not.

00:44:18.690 --> 00:44:22.420
It has less than 3-to-1, and so
that this would actually fail that

00:44:22.420 --> 00:44:27.410
because this triangle, I need to
perceive or distinguish the triangle

00:44:27.410 --> 00:44:28.410
from the background.

00:44:29.210 --> 00:44:31.890
One I can address this is
to add order to the icons.

00:44:31.890 --> 00:44:35.080
If you do that in general, to the
little icons you're using like that,

00:44:35.080 --> 00:44:37.700
then you can be confident that
it will have enough contrast

00:44:37.700 --> 00:44:38.980
on any color background.

00:44:40.220 --> 00:44:41.290
OK, so we are real close.

00:44:41.290 --> 00:44:42.650
We are almost done here.

00:44:42.650 --> 00:44:44.850
Just going to wrap it
up with one final thing,

00:44:44.850 --> 00:44:46.580
and that is an error message.

00:44:46.580 --> 00:44:48.780
So what if I add an error message?

00:44:48.780 --> 00:44:50.850
You must agree to the
terms of use to continue.

00:44:52.490 --> 00:44:58.040
So one final thing related
to graphics is that you need

00:44:58.040 --> 00:45:01.710
to have that 3-to-1 contrast
if the graphic is required

00:45:01.710 --> 00:45:06.360
to understand what's going
on, if it's an enhancement.

00:45:07.560 --> 00:45:09.570
And in this case,
it's become an enhancement.

00:45:09.570 --> 00:45:11.830
There's no contrast requirement.

00:45:11.830 --> 00:45:14.530
Now it's great that it's there and
I would definitely recommend it,

00:45:14.530 --> 00:45:17.540
but the error message on its
own is enough to tell you

00:45:17.540 --> 00:45:19.950
that there's an error here.

00:45:19.950 --> 00:45:20.680
It appeared.

00:45:20.680 --> 00:45:22.170
It wasn't there before.

00:45:22.170 --> 00:45:24.150
You must agree to the
terms of use to continue,

00:45:24.150 --> 00:45:30.520
it tells me that this
is an in an error state.

00:45:30.520 --> 00:45:34.330
So in that case, I would need to
test the contrast, the error message.

00:45:34.330 --> 00:45:39.110
I would still highly recommend
a good high contrast alert icon,

00:45:39.110 --> 00:45:45.110
but on its own,
that would not be required.

00:45:46.140 --> 00:45:48.860
So we made it.

00:45:48.860 --> 00:45:50.270
I know that was that
was pretty quick.

00:45:50.270 --> 00:45:53.210
That was about as fast as
I know how to go with this.

00:45:53.210 --> 00:45:55.240
But that just gives you an idea
that we're actually up to 20,

00:45:55.240 --> 00:45:58.120
and really even more with
that button that I threw in;

00:45:58.120 --> 00:46:00.480
different things that
you would need to test.

00:46:00.480 --> 00:46:03.660
So just be mindful with
your contrast testing.

00:46:03.660 --> 00:46:06.980
I think the big key is
interact with that thing.

00:46:06.980 --> 00:46:10.340
You interact, figure out what
are its different states.

00:46:10.340 --> 00:46:13.670
Submit things with errors so
that you can test the errors

00:46:13.670 --> 00:46:15.030
of those as well.

00:46:15.030 --> 00:46:16.830
And I think those are
going to be the real keys

00:46:16.830 --> 00:46:21.510
to really bring the number of
those checks up pretty quickly.

00:46:22.870 --> 00:46:24.110
OK, so we are at the end.

00:46:24.110 --> 00:46:27.230
Thank you so much, and I'm going
to go back through a few questions.

00:46:27.230 --> 00:46:32.920
We have about four minutes
remaining for questions.

00:46:32.920 --> 00:46:36.680
We do have a link to that
that WebAIM resource page.

00:46:36.680 --> 00:46:39.600
We have a lot of other resources on
the WebAIM site, discussion list,

00:46:39.600 --> 00:46:43.270
newsletter, and info about
the services we offer.

00:46:43.270 --> 00:46:45.660
So with that,
I'm going to stop my share

00:46:46.670 --> 00:46:51.370
and just take a look at these last
couple of questions that came in.

00:46:51.370 --> 00:46:54.900
Yes, so one thing Beatrice
asked, it really is

00:46:54.900 --> 00:46:57.710
that the test is really
foreground and background of text,

00:46:57.710 --> 00:46:58.750
and some kind of skipping around.

00:46:58.750 --> 00:47:01.480
The question is: Do we need
to perform contrast tests

00:47:01.480 --> 00:47:04.860
with the background of the
overall page? Absolutely.

00:47:04.860 --> 00:47:07.600
So I used white,
kind of as a default for these,

00:47:07.600 --> 00:47:10.070
but it's really going to be
whatever that background color is.

00:47:10.070 --> 00:47:11.810
And it's very often not white.

00:47:11.810 --> 00:47:13.400
It's going to be some other color.

00:47:13.400 --> 00:47:19.420
So yes.

00:47:19.420 --> 00:47:22.220
Gary asked that question about
not relying fully on color

00:47:22.220 --> 00:47:24.970
of contrast,
and also using ARIA attributes.

00:47:24.970 --> 00:47:28.870
I think a key to the question
that you asked, Jerry or Gary,

00:47:28.870 --> 00:47:34.700
is definitely also ARIA attributes.

00:47:34.700 --> 00:47:36.550
This is everything.

00:47:36.550 --> 00:47:41.100
All we've talked about 100% has
been about the visual experience,

00:47:41.100 --> 00:47:44.460
and you would definitely want to
enhance that experience using ARIA

00:47:44.460 --> 00:47:47.170
to make sure that somebody knows,
for example, it's in an error state,

00:47:47.170 --> 00:47:49.340
and has that error message read.

00:47:49.340 --> 00:47:51.500
But that would be in addition
to all of those color

00:47:51.500 --> 00:47:55.560
and contrast requirements still
being in place regardless of the ARIA

00:47:55.560 --> 00:47:59.200
that you are using.

00:48:02.120 --> 00:48:04.000
Avoiding placement of text
on gradient backgrounds

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:05.760
is generally best practice? Yes.

00:48:05.760 --> 00:48:06.330
I think so.

00:48:06.330 --> 00:48:08.150
Or busy images.

00:48:08.150 --> 00:48:10.990
I mean, sometimes a gradient
can be quite subtle,

00:48:10.990 --> 00:48:15.200
and I think that's OK, but a
really pretty significant gradient

00:48:15.200 --> 00:48:19.850
or very busy background images.

00:48:19.850 --> 00:48:21.840
Would you say that avoiding
the placement of text

00:48:21.840 --> 00:48:24.450
on a gradient background
is generally best practice?

00:48:24.450 --> 00:48:27.200
I think in general, unless
that gradient is pretty subtle.

00:48:29.460 --> 00:48:37.330
Are there color palette resources
that we are not really calling colors

00:48:37.330 --> 00:48:40.340
that will help set up a theme
so that all the colors will work

00:48:40.340 --> 00:48:42.980
in any state use at the beginning?
Absolutely.

00:48:42.980 --> 00:48:44.804
I think having color palettes,

00:48:44.805 --> 00:48:47.540
and parts of style
guide are really useful.

00:48:48.790 --> 00:48:52.220
I can’t quite remember the
link to one or two tools

00:48:52.220 --> 00:48:54.290
that can help you with
color palette building.

00:48:54.290 --> 00:48:57.440
If anyone knows of one that they want
to share in the chat, that's great.

00:48:57.440 --> 00:48:59.111
Of course,
you can definitely use tools

00:48:59.112 --> 00:49:00.490
like the contrast checking tools

00:49:00.490 --> 00:49:03.720
that we’ve talked about within
WebAIM to determine what are

00:49:03.720 --> 00:49:06.230
some of those colors
and those differences.

00:49:06.230 --> 00:49:10.020
I can’t, off the top of my head,
think of a tool that helps you

00:49:10.020 --> 00:49:11.170
with that color palette building.

00:49:13.310 --> 00:49:16.840
Then last question: Usually workflow,
when deciding on color styles

00:49:16.840 --> 00:49:21.250
for a website, what tools or
checks do you typically rely on?

00:49:21.250 --> 00:49:21.740
Yes, thank you.

00:49:21.740 --> 00:49:25.070
Someone mentioned, I think,
Adobe does have that tool.

00:49:25.070 --> 00:49:26.920
Then there's a couple that
are being added in the chat

00:49:26.920 --> 00:49:29.990
for that last question
about palette builders.

00:49:43.867 --> 00:49:45.640
Jason, I'm sorry, could you
remind me of that last question?

00:49:45.640 --> 00:49:47.360
I distracted myself.

00:49:47.360 --> 00:49:48.280
 <v Jason> Oh, sorry.

00:49:49.297 --> 00:49:50.710
This last one.

00:49:54.950 --> 00:49:57.359
 <v Jonathan> And I think it was
just about workflows and processes.

00:49:57.360 --> 00:50:02.190
And I think for that one,
the process is typically going

00:50:02.190 --> 00:50:07.290
to be testing contrast in its
default state using tools like WAVE,

00:50:07.290 --> 00:50:11.280
and then a really big part of
it becomes the interactions.

00:50:11.280 --> 00:50:13.180
I think that can be
done one of two ways.

00:50:13.180 --> 00:50:16.150
Either remember that while
you're testing interactions,

00:50:16.150 --> 00:50:18.460
mouse and keyboard and
things like that, remember

00:50:18.460 --> 00:50:20.950
to always test contrast
with those interactions.

00:50:20.950 --> 00:50:24.690
Or I will often just
do my contrast testing.

00:50:24.690 --> 00:50:29.740
So it's like, OK, default, focus,
hover, error, active, you know,

00:50:29.740 --> 00:50:30.780
all the different states.

00:50:30.780 --> 00:50:35.050
And I think it's a lot easier to
cover my basis if I do those all

00:50:35.050 --> 00:50:36.050
at the same time.

00:50:37.230 --> 00:50:38.760
I think I’m out of time.

00:50:38.760 --> 00:50:39.540
Thank you so much.

00:50:39.540 --> 00:50:42.730
If I can, I'll type answers to
these other questions as I go.

00:50:42.730 --> 00:50:45.330
Or if there are any
other questions.

00:50:45.330 --> 00:50:47.670
 <v Jason> Yes,
I think you wrap them all up.

00:50:47.670 --> 00:50:48.680
Thank you very much, Jon.

00:50:48.680 --> 00:50:50.000
That was a great session.

00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:51.443
And you took care of all
the questions for me;

00:50:51.444 --> 00:50:52.210
made my job really easy.

00:50:53.370 --> 00:50:56.010
So thanks again.

00:50:56.010 --> 00:50:59.860
