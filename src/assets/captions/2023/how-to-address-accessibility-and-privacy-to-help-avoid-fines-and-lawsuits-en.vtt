00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:14.830
With speakers, Donata
Stroink-Skillrud, President, Termageddon;

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:20.060
and Hans Skillrud, co-founder and

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.436
<v Laura Adamonis>
My name is Laura Adamonis,

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.426
and I am a website
designer with my own agency.

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.306
I volunteer as a content
creator for the training team

at learn.wordpress.org.

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.066
I live in North Carolina, but
I'm originally from Chicago.

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.020
I have a passion for
UX/UI and accessibility.

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.690
Thank you for joining us for
How to Address Accessibility

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:52.630
and Privacy to Help
Avoid Fines and Lawsuits,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.560
with Donata Stroink-Skillrud
and Hans Skillrud.

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:06.206
Donata, Esquire, CIPP is
an attorney licensed in Illinois,

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:09.150
and a certified information
privacy professional.

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.440
Donata is also the president and
legal engineer behind Termageddon,

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.606
and is responsible for
the policy questions, text,

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.030
and keeping clients’ policies up
to date with changing legislation.

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.210
Donata is the chair of the American
Bar Association's ePrivacy committee,

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.646
member of the ABA's Cyber
Security Legal Task Force,

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.480
and member of the Science
and Technology Section Council.

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.540
Donata is also a fellow of
the American Bar Foundation.

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:45.626
Hans ran a 12-person web
design agency for about a decade

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:48.880
prior to selling that business
and running Termageddon full time

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:49.510
with his wife.

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.736
At Termageddon, Hans
oversees partnership

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:55.870
and business
development opportunities,

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:59.526
and spends his time providing
education to website owners

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:01.920
about the importance
of website policies.

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:06.670
Outside of Termageddon, Hans
spends his free time metal detecting,

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:15.796
interesting, working
with Arduinos.

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:24.940
Working at his garden and
doing fun activities outside.

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.580
They are fellow Chicagoans
with a love of pizza.

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.996
So I had to ask the big
question, thin or thick crust,

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:33.010
and they love it all.

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:37.050
Their favorite for thin crust
is Pizanos and their favorite

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.380
for thick crust is Piquads.

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:47.496
Please feel free to add your
questions in the Zoom Q&amp;A section

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.700
and we'll answer them
at the end of the session.

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.296
Use the chat to connect
with other attendees.

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.386
Let's have a warm welcome
for Donata and Hans.

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:59.370
<v Donata> Thank
you so much, Laura.

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:04.190
And thank you everybody for
joining us for our talk on privacy

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:05.646
and accessibility.

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:09.330
<v Hans> And I'd imagine
everyone here couldn't be more excited

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:12.010
to talk about privacy
policies and whatnot, right?

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:14.110
I would assume
everyone's super excited.

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.700
<v Donata> I'm excited.

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.310
<v Hans> Hopefully if
there's still people at the end

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:19.520
of this presentation, like at least
one person, then we've done our job.

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:21.570
<v Donata> Right.
Definitely. Definitely.

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:24.710
So we're going to
share our screen now

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:28.230
because we do have a presentation,
but definitely put your questions

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:28.920
in the chat.

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:31.872
And let us know if you have any
questions;

00:03:31.896 --> 00:03:33.760
we'll be answering those
at the end.

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.920
Like Laura said, we're going to talk
about how to address accessibility

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.870
and privacy to help
avoid fines and lawsuits.

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:45.530
So the first thing we wanted
to say is, because we are going

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:49.710
to be talking about laws, rules,
and regulations, the information

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:52.860
that we talk about today is
for informational purposes only,

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:55.200
and it’s not to be
considered legal advice.

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.470
If you are looking for legal
advice, make sure to reach out

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:00.140
to an attorney in
your area for that.

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:02.826
<v Hans> And this does
include the Q&amp;A session.

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:04.770
We highly encourage everyone.

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:07.790
If you have any questions about
cookie policies, cookie consents,

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:11.886
or the intersection between
accessibility and privacy or policies,

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:14.316
please feel free to
ask any questions.

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.370
Just remember that
everything we provide today is

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:17.700
for informational purposes only.

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:18.560
<v Donata> Exactly.

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:20.710
So we were already introduced.

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:22.496
I don't think we have
to go through this again.

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.040
And I think we can
just jump right in.

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:25.346
<v Hans> Oh we can do a summary.

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:28.196
This is a photo of Donata
and a photo of myself.

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:31.940
and Donata's bio basically
outlines that she's the smart one

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:35.820
and I am more or so the
character in the group, I would say.

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:40.656
<v Donata> Very
true. OK. All right.

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:46.080
So we have a pretty packed
agenda and we're going to talk about

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.510
how privacy and
accessibility intersect.

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:50.160
Why they matter.

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:52.896
Who needs to follow
these requirements?

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:56.160
Who needs to have a privacy
policy, and a cookie policy,

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:58.870
and how to properly
display those policies.

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:01.530
As well as who needs a
cookie consent banner,

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:04.430
and how to properly display it,
and what those should look like.

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:08.470
We'll also talk about obtaining
consent in an accessible way,

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:09.766
and why that matters.

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:11.720
As well as examples
of dark patterns.

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:15.250
So basically what to
do and what not to do.

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:18.580
So we'll show you some
examples, and then some final tips

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:21.850
on meeting privacy and accessibility
requirements, and then we'll go

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:23.543
into the Q&amp;A.

00:05:25.283 --> 00:05:27.730
<v Hans> So a lot of you
probably have an understanding

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:31.280
of what accessibility is, but
because we're coming more

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:34.710
from a privacy expertise, we want
to at least cover what privacy is.

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:38.610
So privacy is generally defined
as being left alone, or the state

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:40.690
of being free from
observation by others.

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:44.300
I will say, though, that privacy,
I think, means different things

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:45.220
to different people.

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:48.620
But really, what's
happening here in the world is

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:52.000
that we have governments
protecting and regulating

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.060
the personal information
of their people.

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:58.220
So personal information is
anything that could be used

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:02.436
to identify an individual, that is
personally identifiable information,

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:04.515
otherwise known as PII.

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:07.380
So governments around the
world are creating regulations

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:10.560
to protect people's PII
so that website owners

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:13.360
or companies can't just
take that personal information

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:15.530
and do whatever
they want with it.

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:17.740
Here in the States, we
actually have a friend visiting

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:19.826
from the UK over the last week.

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:22.590
And the moment he got to
America, he started getting

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:24.565
about 30 spam calls a day.

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:26.800
And that is an infringement
on privacy, at least

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:30.720
in many people's opinions, and
that is what governments are trying

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:33.366
to help regulate and
prevent from happening.

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:35.890
<v Donata> Yes, and
privacy basically means

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:38.610
that people can determine
the level of interaction

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:41.176
that they would like to
have with a company online.

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:44.220
So if I want to receive email
marketing from a company,

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:46.026
I can say, Yes, I
would like to receive it.

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:48.406
Or I can say, No, I
would not like to receive it.

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:50.500
Or I would like to receive
text messages from you,

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:52.306
or maybe I don't
want to do that.

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:54.606
So it's a level of interaction
that they would like to have

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:55.730
with a company online.

00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:58.850
<v Hans> And there's nothing wrong
with collecting personal information.

00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:01.236
In fact, I always advocate
that's a great thing.

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:04.220
What we need to understand
today as website owners is

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:06.760
that we need to get
consent first prior to collecting

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:09.610
people's information, and also
making sure our policies are

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:11.810
up to date with accurate
disclosures you're required

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:13.320
to make under applicable laws.

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:15.700
<v Donata> Yes, and
what is accessibility?

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:19.476
So accessibility is defined as
the practice of making information,

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:23.100
activities, and environment
sensible, meaningful, and usable for

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:24.700
as many people as possible.

00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:28.580
So it basically means that people
can interact, comprehend, navigate,

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:31.040
and contribute to
the online world.

00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:35.636
Privacy and accessibility, even
though they're two distinct concepts,

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:39.040
they do intersect together to
create a digital world that is open

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:41.986
to everyone, regardless
of their disability status

00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:43.800
or their privacy preferences.

00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:47.486
Accessibility can
interact with privacy

00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:50.300
because it can make
privacy-centric features compliant

00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:54.350
with privacy laws, because
privacy laws do require accessibility.

00:07:54.910 --> 00:07:58.900
Privacy can make accessibility
features usable without somebody needing

00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:02.630
to sacrifice their personal
preferences on their privacy,

00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:05.926
meaning they don't have to
sacrifice the level of interaction

00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:08.176
that they would like to
have with companies online,

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:11.580
and they don't have to sacrifice
their privacy rights as well.

00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:13.820
<v Hans> And we have a
handful of examples to go

00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:17.030
through today to kind of
really instill this concept

00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:18.770
into everyone's minds today.

00:08:18.770 --> 00:08:20.452
<v Donata> Absolutely.

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:23.700
So why do privacy
and accessibility matter?

00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:27.286
We have a couple of
reasons as to why, but first,

00:08:27.310 --> 00:08:28.930
it's really the
right thing to do.

00:08:29.530 --> 00:08:32.270
Presenting your website
visitors with an accessible

00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:35.840
and privacy-conscious
website is the right thing to do.

00:08:36.250 --> 00:08:39.610
So you should allow people to
clearly see privacy information

00:08:39.610 --> 00:08:43.410
and make privacy-related
selections to allow them to determine

00:08:43.410 --> 00:08:45.690
how they would like to
interact with you and how.

00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:48.086
And then providing
an accessible website.

00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:50.438
Make sure that everyone can use the
website

00:08:50.462 --> 00:08:52.400
without difficulty or frustration.

00:08:52.425 --> 00:08:55.565
So they both work together
to make a better web.

00:08:56.710 --> 00:09:00.020
Secondly, it's actually good for
business to care about privacy.

00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:05.696
So if you think about 10 years
ago, privacy wasn't really a big deal.

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:09.090
People didn't really look at
privacy policies, or look to see

00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:10.990
if somebody had a
cookie consent banner.

00:09:11.390 --> 00:09:15.226
They didn't care if you track them via
Google Analytics or Facebook Pixel.

00:09:15.250 --> 00:09:18.190
At least for most people,
but that has changed.

00:09:18.210 --> 00:09:22.010
And that really changed with
the Cambridge Analytica scandal.

00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:26.220
Cambridge Analytica took the
personal information of millions

00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:28.976
of Facebook users
without their permission

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.496
and used it to manipulate
political advertisements.

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:35.880
And that really brought privacy to
the forefront of consumers' minds.

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:39.960
They really realized, If I provide
my information to a company,

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:41.810
they can do pretty
much anything with it,

00:09:41.810 --> 00:09:43.876
and there's nothing
I can do about that.

00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:47.436
And that's where all these privacy
laws and regulations really come from.

00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:50.190
Today, people are actually
more concerned about their privacy

00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:53.310
than ever before, and they
are willing to make decisions on

00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:56.586
who to do business with
based on privacy practices.

00:09:56.610 --> 00:09:58.900
And there's a lot of studies
that talk about this, but two

00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:03.240
that I wanted to highlight,
32% have switched companies

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:06.770
because of privacy practices, meaning
that they went from one company

00:10:06.770 --> 00:10:08.920
to another because
of privacy concerns.

00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:12.190
And seven in ten Canadians
refused to provide data

00:10:12.190 --> 00:10:15.420
to a company over privacy
concerns, meaning that seven

00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:19.476
in ten Canadians, for example,
would not fill out a contact form

00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:23.490
if they don't feel comfortable
or they don't receive

00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:26.240
sufficient information about
what you will do with their PII.

00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:30.960
Accessible websites can also be
a competitive advantage as well.

00:10:31.450 --> 00:10:35.440
So 75% of Americans with
disabilities report using the internet

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:36.660
on a daily basis.

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:39.980
And the market that includes
people with disabilities is estimated

00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:43.740
to control over $13 trillion
in annual disposable income,

00:10:44.290 --> 00:10:45.976
which is huge for
business, right?

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.560
So if you have a website
that allows these people

00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:53.860
to use your website to make
purchases or subscribe to emails

00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:56.780
or whatever they want to
do, you are opening yourself

00:10:56.780 --> 00:10:57.820
up to a larger market.

00:10:57.820 --> 00:11:01.160
<v Hans> There's two
more items too, and they kind

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:04.063
of go hand in hand, which is
avoiding fines and lawsuits.

00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:09.786
I'm sure throughout WordPress
Accessibility Day, this has been discussed;

00:11:09.810 --> 00:11:11.950
and sure enough,
we're covering it as well.

00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:16.360
The fact is though is there are
privacy non-compliance fines.

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:19.200
There are one-person
marketing companies getting fined,

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:22.710
what was it, 60,000 euros
for changing the email address

00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:25.110
of one of their subscribers
without their consent.

00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:30.146
And I think really what comes
into play here is that I think a lot

00:11:30.170 --> 00:11:34.530
of people see in the news, like,
Facebook getting fined billions

00:11:34.530 --> 00:11:36.426
of dollars for privacy issues.

00:11:36.450 --> 00:11:39.870
But they don't see our small
businesses like one-person companies

00:11:39.870 --> 00:11:43.720
even getting fined for non-compliance
from a privacy standpoint.

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:46.910
So fines and lawsuits, I
mean, we have it listed here.

00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:49.936
But really, the long
story short is, failure

00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:54.990
to comply with applicable accessibility
laws and privacy laws can result

00:11:54.990 --> 00:11:57.420
in your business getting
into financial trouble as well.

00:11:57.420 --> 00:11:59.126
So it's not only
the right thing to do,

00:11:59.150 --> 00:12:00.820
but not doing it actually
gets you in trouble.

00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:04.390
So it's like double whammy
to stay focused on valuing this.

00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:06.940
<v Donata> Yes, so privacy
law is currently enforced

00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:10.050
by Data Protection Authorities
and attorney generals.

00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:14.570
So the fines for non-compliance
start $2,500 per violation,

00:12:14.570 --> 00:12:18.320
meaning per website visitor whose
privacy rights have been infringed upon.

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:21.736
So let's say you have 100
website visitors from California

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:25.760
and you don't have a compliant
privacy policy, that fine is calculated

00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:29.706
as 2,500 times 100, which
can add up really quickly.

00:12:29.730 --> 00:12:31.910
Although, there are also
proposed privacy bills

00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:35.330
that would allow consumers
to sue businesses of any size,

00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:38.640
of any revenue, of any
employee size directly

00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:40.886
for privacy law
violations as well.

00:12:40.910 --> 00:12:44.090
So now we're seeing so
many accessibility lawsuits,

00:12:44.090 --> 00:12:46.450
but we're probably going
to see the same thing

00:12:46.450 --> 00:12:49.150
with privacy once
these laws are passed.

00:12:49.150 --> 00:12:51.730
<v Hans> Yes. If I'm not mistaken, actually,

00:12:51.754 --> 00:12:54.776
lawsuits for accessibility
came out of New York.

00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:58.036
And then sure enough, New
York has two bills out right now.

00:12:58.060 --> 00:13:01.066
If any of them pass, it
will enable any New Yorker

00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:04.630
to sue any website owner for
collecting as little as an email address

00:13:04.630 --> 00:13:09.880
in a contact form without specific
New York privacy law disclosures.

00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:12.610
So, yes, it's good motivation.

00:13:12.610 --> 00:13:14.774
It's the right thing to do
though is number one.

00:13:15.627 --> 00:13:18.446
<v Donata> So who needs
to follow privacy requirements?

00:13:18.470 --> 00:13:22.726
As Hans explained earlier, privacy
laws govern the collection, use,

00:13:22.750 --> 00:13:26.060
and disclosure of personally
identifiable information.

00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:30.076
So PII is any information
that could identify somebody,

00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:33.370
or any information related
to an identified person.

00:13:33.370 --> 00:13:38.826
And examples of PII include names,
emails, phone numbers, IP addresses,

00:13:38.850 --> 00:13:41.150
or physical addresses
such as the billing address.

00:13:41.650 --> 00:13:44.536
And those are commonly
collected through contact forms,

00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:48.490
email newsletter subscription
forms, e-commerce forms, analytics,

00:13:48.490 --> 00:13:52.170
like Google analytics, or advertising
features like Facebook Pixel.

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:55.360
What’s important to note
here is that privacy laws apply

00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:57.946
as soon as that information
is being collected.

00:13:57.970 --> 00:14:01.180
So you don't have to actually
use it, you don't have to disclose it,

00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:03.480
you don't need to share it,
and you don't need to sell it.

00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:06.280
The moment that that
information is being collected,

00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:07.800
that's when privacy laws apply.

00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:12.096
<v Hans> And just want to provide
a little footnote of education here.

00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:15.130
We have so many business owners
that say, Well, I don't share any

00:14:15.130 --> 00:14:16.685
of the data I collect.

00:14:16.710 --> 00:14:20.896
And I like to always just make note
of an example that's very common.

00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:23.930
If you have a contact form
on your website contact page

00:14:23.930 --> 00:14:26.790
and someone submits an
inquiry, and you receive an email

00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:29.450
in your inbox with that
person's contact details,

00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:32.360
you've not only collected their
personal information like names

00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:34.626
and emails, but you've
actually shared that data

00:14:34.650 --> 00:14:38.060
with your email service provider,
whether it's G Suite, Gmail,

00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:43.036
Outlook, or any other third-party
email service system you use.

00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:45.520
So sharing data,
extremely common.

00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:48.106
What's not so
common is selling data.

00:14:48.130 --> 00:14:51.490
But sharing data, very common,
and that can be a required disclosure

00:14:51.556 --> 00:14:53.576
under certain privacy laws.

00:14:54.543 --> 00:14:57.480
<v Donata> So you will need
to follow privacy requirements

00:14:57.480 --> 00:15:01.580
if you collect PII, like names,
emails, phone numbers,

00:15:02.068 --> 00:15:06.320
and if privacy laws and their
requirements apply to you.

00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:10.276
Privacy laws do not apply to
every single business out there,

00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:13.280
but they protect consumers,
and they don't protect businesses.

00:15:13.690 --> 00:15:15.890
So that means that they
can apply to you regardless of

00:15:15.890 --> 00:15:18.980
whether you're located in the
state or country that passed that law.

00:15:19.450 --> 00:15:22.456
And that's because of the
broad nature of the internet, right?

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:25.380
So people from anywhere could
submit their personal information

00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:26.280
to your website.

00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:29.160
So to figure out what
privacy laws apply to you,

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:31.596
you should ask
yourself some questions.

00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:34.066
So whose PII are
you collecting online?

00:15:34.090 --> 00:15:35.670
Like, who's submitting
these forms?

00:15:36.090 --> 00:15:39.120
Who are you tracking online
through cookies, pixels, analytics?

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:41.810
So if you have those
features on your website,

00:15:42.210 --> 00:15:44.430
who's coming onto your
website and being tracked?

00:15:45.180 --> 00:15:47.157
Where are your
customers located?

00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:48.586
Where do you do business?

00:15:48.610 --> 00:15:51.066
And where do you
offer goods or services?

00:15:51.090 --> 00:15:55.230
So most privacy laws will apply to
businesses regardless of their revenue

00:15:55.230 --> 00:15:56.675
or employee size.

00:15:56.700 --> 00:15:58.686
So they will apply
to small businesses,

00:15:58.710 --> 00:16:02.256
and a lot of privacy laws
actually apply to nonprofits as well.

00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:06.030
But some privacy laws will
exempt smaller businesses.

00:16:06.030 --> 00:16:08.520
So it is important to first
determine what laws apply to you.

00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:08.980
<v Hans> That's right.

00:16:08.980 --> 00:16:11.440
And just to reiterate,
because you have a website

00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:14.070
and you could collect
inquiries from all over, it's good

00:16:14.070 --> 00:16:16.046
to remember privacy
laws protect people.

00:16:16.070 --> 00:16:17.910
They don't care where
your business is located.

00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:21.350
And I know you just said it,
but I'd just like to say it louder.

00:16:22.930 --> 00:16:25.556
<v Donata> So there
are a lot of privacy laws

00:16:25.580 --> 00:16:28.150
that govern the collection
of PII by websites.

00:16:28.150 --> 00:16:30.850
We won't go through each and
every one of these because I don't want

00:16:30.850 --> 00:16:33.580
to bore you to death, but
just a couple examples.

00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:37.250
So the California Online Privacy
and Protection Act, that applies

00:16:37.250 --> 00:16:40.876
to any business that collects the
personal information of residents

00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:41.720
of California.

00:16:42.210 --> 00:16:45.956
So people from California could
submit a form on your website,

00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:49.480
or you could collect their IP
address or like Facebook pixel,

00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:51.250
you need to
comply with that law.

00:16:51.970 --> 00:16:55.970
Whereas other laws like Nevada
Revised Statute Chapter 603A,

00:16:56.350 --> 00:16:58.000
for that law to apply
to you, you will need

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.760
to collect the personal
information of residents of Nevada,

00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:03.520
but you will also have to
do business in that state.

00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:06.370
So as you can see, there are
different factors to determine

00:17:06.370 --> 00:17:08.580
which privacy laws
actually apply to you.

00:17:08.580 --> 00:17:12.230
And it's really funny because
since creating these slides,

00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:13.970
there's a new privacy
law that was passed,

00:17:13.970 --> 00:17:18.330
the Delaware Personal Data Protection
Act, which we haven't had a chance

00:17:18.330 --> 00:17:19.026
to add to that.

00:17:19.050 --> 00:17:22.766
But I think that just kind of illustrates
how frequently these change.

00:17:22.790 --> 00:17:26.490
So there's over two dozen
privacy bills proposed in the U.S.

00:17:26.490 --> 00:17:29.560
Countries such as the
United Kingdom, Australia,

00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:33.076
and Canada are proposing
reform to their privacy laws

00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:36.950
because of new technologies
that create new privacy harms.

00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:38.646
So the laws have to keep up.

00:17:38.670 --> 00:17:40.350
So these things are
constantly changing.

00:17:40.350 --> 00:17:43.116
<v Hans> And really, I think
the big takeaway there is,

00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:46.580
as a website owner, I used to
copy and paste privacy policies

00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:49.670
whenever I needed them, and
then I married a privacy attorney,

00:17:49.670 --> 00:17:51.546
so that obviously changed.

00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:55.100
But really, the takeaway
is I think the era of copying

00:17:55.100 --> 00:17:58.630
and pasting legal docs is not
only a terrible strategy upfront,

00:17:58.630 --> 00:18:01.510
because chances are you're
not compliant with the actual laws

00:18:01.510 --> 00:18:02.795
that apply to you.

00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:05.850
But also, it doesn't answer the
question of how do you keep your policies

00:18:05.850 --> 00:18:06.900
up to date over time?

00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:08.980
This isn't a sales pitch.

00:18:08.980 --> 00:18:10.440
I mean, obviously,
talk to your attorney.

00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:12.926
There are generators out
there like Termageddon 2.

00:18:12.950 --> 00:18:15.670
But really, the most important
thing is understanding

00:18:15.670 --> 00:18:18.610
that you can't just have a
privacy policy in this day and age.

00:18:18.610 --> 00:18:21.060
You have to have a strategy
to keep it up to date over time.

00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:22.842
<v Donata> Exactly.

00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:26.490
So who needs to follow
accessibility requirements?

00:18:26.890 --> 00:18:30.580
So Title II of the ADA applies
to all services, programs,

00:18:30.580 --> 00:18:33.186
and activities of state
and local governments.

00:18:33.210 --> 00:18:35.000
So if you're part of state
and local government,

00:18:35.020 --> 00:18:36.620
you obviously
have to follow them.

00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:41.446
And Title III of the ADA applies
to businesses open to the public.

00:18:41.470 --> 00:18:44.946
So there is a case that
GIL versus Winn-Dixie Court

00:18:44.970 --> 00:18:48.150
that ruled that websites may
constitute public accommodations

00:18:48.570 --> 00:18:51.446
and therefore be
subject to the ADA.

00:18:51.470 --> 00:18:53.906
So those must be accessible.

00:18:53.930 --> 00:18:57.390
And although websites or apps
are not explicitly stated in the law,

00:18:57.860 --> 00:19:00.080
the online world is
increasingly being considered

00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:03.860
as a public accommodation, and
there are a lot of cases that support that.

00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:07.820
In the EU, we have the EU
Web Accessibility Directive

00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:12.176
and the European Accessibility Act,
which requires public sector entities

00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:14.940
and private companies to
provide accessible experiences

00:19:14.940 --> 00:19:16.170
for website visitors.

00:19:16.650 --> 00:19:19.686
The Accessible Canada Act
applies to any organizations

00:19:19.710 --> 00:19:22.170
under federal jurisdiction,
and the Australia

00:19:22.170 --> 00:19:25.620
Disability Discrimination Act
prohibits private and public sectors

00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:28.630
from discriminating against
people based on a disability.

00:19:29.190 --> 00:19:33.070
What's really interesting as a
privacy lawyer that I have seen recently

00:19:33.070 --> 00:19:35.870
in all of the new privacy
laws that I have been proposed

00:19:35.870 --> 00:19:40.310
and passed, is that they also
state that your website features

00:19:40.310 --> 00:19:43.540
that are privacy-focused
must be accessible as well.

00:19:43.540 --> 00:19:46.326
Meaning that your privacy
policy must be accessible,

00:19:46.350 --> 00:19:48.660
your cookie consent
banner must be accessible,

00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:51.436
and your cookie policy
must be accessible as well.

00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:54.200
So it seems like the two
worlds are merging much more

00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:58.000
than 10 years ago, where any
new laws passed didn't really talk

00:19:58.000 --> 00:19:59.770
about accessibility,
but they do now.

00:20:02.550 --> 00:20:05.980
So Hans, maybe you can
explain who needs a privacy policy?

00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:10.890
<v Hans> Sure. So a privacy policy
helps explain your privacy practices

00:20:11.330 --> 00:20:14.160
and it's usually created to
comply with privacy laws.

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:18.146
So it all kind of starts with what
personal information you're collecting,

00:20:18.170 --> 00:20:19.800
what you're doing
with that information.

00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:23.130
Like, I collected to contact
you, I collected for marketing

00:20:23.130 --> 00:20:24.725
or advertising.

00:20:24.750 --> 00:20:28.380
Some privacy laws require you to
describe how you collect that information

00:20:28.380 --> 00:20:30.890
or who you may share
it with or if you sell it.

00:20:31.450 --> 00:20:38.536
Really, what it comes down to is
that a good privacy policy is created

00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:40.386
if you know the laws
that apply to you,

00:20:40.410 --> 00:20:43.930
because each privacy law lines
out exactly what you're supposed

00:20:43.930 --> 00:20:44.966
to disclose.

00:20:44.990 --> 00:20:47.560
So your very first step is to find
out the laws that apply to you.

00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:50.346
And then a privacy
policy from there needs

00:20:50.370 --> 00:20:54.120
to include the disclosures
required by those applicable laws.

00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:58.010
Your privacy must fit your actual
business and privacy practices.

00:20:58.010 --> 00:21:00.150
So I think that's one of
those concerns I have

00:21:00.150 --> 00:21:02.730
where people just copy and
paste legal documents like I used to,

00:21:02.730 --> 00:21:04.350
like, I didn't actually read it.

00:21:04.350 --> 00:21:06.830
I don't know if they actually
match my actual business

00:21:06.830 --> 00:21:08.655
and privacy practices.

00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:11.686
And most importantly, they'd
need to stay up to date over time,

00:21:11.710 --> 00:21:14.356
as legislation constantly
changes in this space.

00:21:14.380 --> 00:21:17.370
<v Donata> Yes, and I
think it's important here to note

00:21:17.370 --> 00:21:19.700
that all privacy laws
require Websites

00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:22.126
to have a comprehensive
privacy policy.

00:21:22.150 --> 00:21:25.160
So if any of the privacy laws
apply to you, you will need

00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:28.710
to have a privacy policy
that makes those disclosures.

00:21:30.610 --> 00:21:32.276
Who needs a cookie policy?

00:21:32.300 --> 00:21:35.640
So the cookie policy, its
purpose is to inform users

00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:38.556
about what cookies you
collect, why you collect them,

00:21:38.580 --> 00:21:41.326
and how individuals can
exercise their privacy rights

00:21:41.350 --> 00:21:43.280
by changing their
cookie preferences.

00:21:43.650 --> 00:21:46.770
So for example, how can people
withdraw their consent to cookies

00:21:46.770 --> 00:21:49.970
that they have provided their
consent to before, which is required

00:21:49.970 --> 00:21:52.010
by applicable legislation.

00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:56.450
So you will need a cookie policy,
or you can also have a privacy policy

00:21:56.450 --> 00:21:57.890
that discusses cookies.

00:21:58.530 --> 00:22:01.290
If your website collects cookies,
and if you need to comply

00:22:01.290 --> 00:22:05.920
with the privacy directive, EU's
General Data Protection Regulation,

00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:10.180
UK's Data Protection Act, or
Canada's PIPEDA, because all

00:22:10.180 --> 00:22:14.680
of these laws require businesses to
inform consumers what cookies are

00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:18.010
on a website, and how they
can exercise their cookie choices.

00:22:18.010 --> 00:22:20.290
<v Hans> And I'll also note,
you know, some of you may be,

00:22:20.290 --> 00:22:24.696
like, Well, you know, what
about CPRA or VCDPA?

00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:29.930
That is related to a notice that
website owners are required

00:22:29.930 --> 00:22:32.886
to provide if you sell the
information you collect.

00:22:32.910 --> 00:22:34.510
So I think a lot of
people are surprised

00:22:34.510 --> 00:22:37.600
to hear that a cookie consent
banner is very different based on

00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:39.016
which law applies.

00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:42.286
A California banner is to opt
out of the sale of the information,

00:22:42.310 --> 00:22:46.920
whereas a GDPR, ePrivacy
Directive banner for the EU is more

00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:50.376
about giving people choices and
then being opted out by default,

00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:53.760
and they have to consent to being
tracked for marketing purposes,

00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:54.330
for example.

00:22:54.330 --> 00:22:57.110
<v Donata> And CPRA does
not specifically require you

00:22:57.110 --> 00:23:00.620
to have a cookie consent
banner or a cookie policy.

00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:04.576
They do require you to have a
universal opt-out mechanism,

00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:08.346
and it just seems like everybody
chose to have a cookie consent banner.

00:23:08.370 --> 00:23:10.870
And that's what kind
of became the standard,

00:23:10.870 --> 00:23:13.330
but it's not actually
required by the law per se.

00:23:13.330 --> 00:23:15.276
<v Hans> That's very true.

00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:20.010
<v Donata> In
that particular way.

00:23:20.010 --> 00:23:21.650
<v Hans> Yes, good call.

00:23:21.650 --> 00:23:24.606
Next, to meet the
requirements of privacy laws,

00:23:24.630 --> 00:23:29.366
privacy-related policies must be
posted conspicuously on a website,

00:23:29.390 --> 00:23:32.150
aka make your policy
links easily accessible.

00:23:33.630 --> 00:23:41.970
But a very clear requirement
when providing policies

00:23:41.970 --> 00:23:44.040
on your website is
that they're accessible.

00:23:44.870 --> 00:23:47.070
We’re not talking about, you
know, putting them in your footer

00:23:47.070 --> 00:23:51.136
and having a black background
with super-dark gray text.

00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:52.880
That is not conspicuous.

00:23:53.370 --> 00:23:55.500
Rather, you want it to
stand out, and make sure

00:23:55.500 --> 00:23:57.460
that anyone can see
it from a mile away.

00:23:57.460 --> 00:23:59.260
<v Donata> Right, exactly.

00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:02.860
So conspicuous is kind
of a legal term, right?

00:24:03.453 --> 00:24:05.423
But what does
conspicuous actually mean?

00:24:06.150 --> 00:24:09.996
To be conspicuous, a privacy
policy and a cookie policy,

00:24:10.020 --> 00:24:14.500
they must be displayed in a way that
a reasonable person would notice it.

00:24:14.500 --> 00:24:15.290
So what does that mean?

00:24:15.290 --> 00:24:17.590
So first, the link to
the privacy policy

00:24:17.590 --> 00:24:20.300
and the cookie policy
should be posted on the footer

00:24:20.300 --> 00:24:22.100
of every page of the website.

00:24:22.540 --> 00:24:25.646
Meaning that if I navigate
from the homepage to the blog,

00:24:25.670 --> 00:24:27.100
it should still
be on the footer.

00:24:27.700 --> 00:24:31.036
The link should contain the
word privacy for privacy policy,

00:24:31.060 --> 00:24:32.870
and cookie for cookie policy.

00:24:33.230 --> 00:24:37.440
So that means that a link
that says policy is not sufficient

00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:39.166
to be conspicuous.

00:24:39.190 --> 00:24:41.900
<v Hans> What about a link that
says legal, and then you're taken

00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:43.610
to a page that
provides all the policies?

00:24:43.610 --> 00:24:46.080
<v Donata> Also not
conspicuous, because it needs

00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:47.410
to include the word privacy.

00:24:47.860 --> 00:24:51.080
So if it does not include the
word privacy, it is not conspicuous,

00:24:51.450 --> 00:24:55.176
because people don't
necessarily know what legal means.

00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:58.930
Like, does legal mean your BAT
number and your company address?

00:24:58.930 --> 00:25:00.666
Does it mean your
terms of service?

00:25:00.690 --> 00:25:01.940
Does it mean a contract?

00:25:01.940 --> 00:25:04.090
Does it mean your company
formation document?

00:25:04.090 --> 00:25:06.430
<v Hans> Does it mean that's where
the legal people go to read something?

00:25:06.430 --> 00:25:08.410
<v Donata> I mean, it
could be literally anything.

00:25:08.410 --> 00:25:11.560
So it does have to include the
word privacy for privacy policy,

00:25:11.580 --> 00:25:13.140
and cookie for cookie policy.

00:25:13.850 --> 00:25:17.430
The privacy policy and cookie
policy should sit on separate pages.

00:25:17.430 --> 00:25:21.086
So do not combine a privacy
policy and the terms of service.

00:25:21.110 --> 00:25:22.926
Multiple privacy laws say this.

00:25:22.950 --> 00:25:27.030
In addition, if you have people
agree to privacy policy and the terms

00:25:27.030 --> 00:25:30.880
of service at the same time,
you actually cannot prove consent.

00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:33.656
It can also seem coercive.

00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:35.800
So there's been certain
enforcement actions that said

00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:42.866
that it's coercive to make a
user agree to privacy and terms

00:25:42.890 --> 00:25:46.750
at the same time, because
the user feels like they are

00:25:46.750 --> 00:25:50.560
being subject to contractual
requirements at the same time.

00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:52.640
So do not combine these two.

00:25:53.730 --> 00:25:57.656
Accessibility experts know this,
use contrasting type font or color

00:25:57.680 --> 00:25:59.760
from the surrounding
text if there is any.

00:26:00.340 --> 00:26:03.896
And use contrasting color of
the link as compared to the footer.

00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:06.820
So basically make sure
that it's easily visible.

00:26:07.470 --> 00:26:10.760
And any forms where PII is
being submitted should contain

00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:14.420
a consent checkbox for individuals
to agree to the privacy policy.

00:26:14.810 --> 00:26:18.240
The box should not be pre-checked,
and it should be separate box

00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:21.230
from an agreement to a
terms of service if you do decide

00:26:21.230 --> 00:26:23.330
to have a terms of
service agreement as well.

00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:29.930
OK, so now we're going to go into
my favorite part, which is examples.

00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:33.740
And what's really funny about
this is that when you search

00:26:33.740 --> 00:26:38.896
for examples, it will take you 20
minutes to find all the bad ones,

00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:42.320
and about three weeks
to find all the good ones.

00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:45.120
So that kind of just
illustrates how things work.

00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:45.510
<v Hans> Yes.

00:26:45.510 --> 00:26:47.680
And even in this first
screenshot, you know,

00:26:48.050 --> 00:26:51.906
I think this is a great example
of clearly providing the text

00:26:51.930 --> 00:26:52.820
to the policies.

00:26:52.820 --> 00:26:54.640
However, they're not underlined.

00:26:55.060 --> 00:26:56.950
So people may not
know they're actually links.

00:26:56.950 --> 00:26:59.740
So I would say that's an
improvement for the first screenshot

00:26:59.740 --> 00:27:02.260
we've shown here with
the light pink background,

00:27:02.260 --> 00:27:06.650
and the very completely
black large bold font text.

00:27:07.230 --> 00:27:08.920
<v Donata> But it is
easily visible, right?

00:27:09.420 --> 00:27:11.100
It's a contrast.

00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:13.720
So you have the pink
background, and then you have

00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:16.970
accessibility statement,
privacy policy, code of conduct,

00:27:16.970 --> 00:27:18.010
and contact us.

00:27:18.490 --> 00:27:21.250
As well as social media
links like Facebook, LinkedIn,

00:27:21.250 --> 00:27:25.750
Twitter, and YouTube all in black
so you can very easily pinpoint

00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:27.750
where the policies are.

00:27:28.150 --> 00:27:32.256
In the second example, you'll
see there's a light gray background,

00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:35.360
and then there's privacy
policy, terms and conditions,

00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:38.616
disclaimer, affiliate terms and
conditions, and cookie policy.

00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:42.400
All of them are separated
and they are in dark purple font.

00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:44.490
So they're very easily visible.

00:27:44.490 --> 00:27:46.906
They're not hidden.

00:27:49.012 --> 00:27:52.070
<v Hans> All right. So it’s also
important to understand that

00:27:52.070 --> 00:27:53.660
whenever someone’s
submitting their data,

00:27:53.660 --> 00:27:55.386
it is considered
a best practice.

00:27:55.410 --> 00:27:58.076
And under some privacy
laws, it's a legal requirement

00:27:58.100 --> 00:28:01.560
to ensure that people are
checking a box to agree

00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:06.016
to your privacy policy, and checking
another box to agree to your terms.

00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:09.730
So as you'll see in this example,
this website has a contact

00:28:09.730 --> 00:28:11.850
form asking for
name, email, message,

00:28:12.250 --> 00:28:13.716
and then there are
two check boxes.

00:28:13.740 --> 00:28:17.420
I agree to the privacy policy, and I
agree to the terms and conditions.

00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:22.740
Privacy policy is underlined,
and so upon click it, would open

00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:25.850
in a new tab, the respect to
privacy policy, and the same

00:28:25.850 --> 00:28:27.070
with the terms and conditions.

00:28:27.070 --> 00:28:31.250
So the policies are clearly
linked and underlined and visible.

00:28:31.740 --> 00:28:35.300
Also you'll notice the check
boxes are unselected by default.

00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:39.696
This is very important from a
privacy compliance standpoint.

00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:43.200
You need to capture consent,
the moment people agree.

00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:46.656
So that is why those check
boxes are required fields,

00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:48.920
but you actually have check
them to be able to submit your data.

00:28:49.312 --> 00:28:51.828
<v Donata> Yes, exactly.

00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:56.690
So in this next form,
we have a traveler's form

00:28:56.690 --> 00:28:58.900
where people can book flights.

00:28:59.310 --> 00:29:01.650
So you'll see that they can
book flights from Washington

00:29:01.650 --> 00:29:04.930
to somewhere else, and
then you can click find deals,

00:29:04.930 --> 00:29:07.110
choose your departure
date, things like that.

00:29:07.550 --> 00:29:10.790
And then it has a box that says,
receive our travel deals newsletter.

00:29:11.230 --> 00:29:14.326
Now, what's good about this
box is that it's not pre-checked.

00:29:14.350 --> 00:29:17.090
However, it does not
obtain proper consent

00:29:17.460 --> 00:29:21.150
because it is not providing a
privacy policy, and it does not link

00:29:21.170 --> 00:29:22.480
to a privacy policy.

00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:25.900
So here, even though they're
obtaining consent for their newsletter,

00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:28.836
which is great, they should
also have another box that says,

00:29:28.860 --> 00:29:32.630
I agree to the privacy policy
because their data is being collected.

00:29:34.964 --> 00:29:38.040
<v Hans> We probably should
have updated these slides to

00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:40.496
How not to display
your website policy.

00:29:40.520 --> 00:29:43.000
But do you want
to take this one?

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:43.936
<v Donata> Sure.

00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:47.746
So this is an example of
the text of the privacy policy.

00:29:47.770 --> 00:29:50.016
So the first one says,
sale of your information.

00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:52.146
We do not sell your
personal information.

00:29:52.170 --> 00:29:55.550
Please see the ‘Your rights’
section below for more information

00:29:55.550 --> 00:29:58.250
about exercising your
privacy rights regarding sales

00:29:58.250 --> 00:30:01.600
of your personal information.
Very common disclosure for people

00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:04.380
who need to comply with
privacy laws that require them

00:30:04.380 --> 00:30:07.580
to disclose whether
information is being sold.

00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:12.210
Now, in this first box, the
font is very clearly contrasted.

00:30:13.550 --> 00:30:16.300
The background is white
and then the text itself is black.

00:30:16.690 --> 00:30:18.006
So it's very easy to see.

00:30:18.030 --> 00:30:19.290
The font is large.

00:30:19.770 --> 00:30:24.366
So most people can see it
without having to actually zoom in

00:30:24.390 --> 00:30:26.376
or anything like that.

00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:30.160
On the second box, we have
another example of a privacy policy.

00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:35.446
So it says payment data, like
cardholder last name, date of card use.

00:30:35.470 --> 00:30:36.710
What do we use it for?

00:30:36.710 --> 00:30:39.050
We use it in credit
card fraud prevention.

00:30:39.410 --> 00:30:43.756
Now, this example is actually not
great because of very low contrast.

00:30:43.780 --> 00:30:47.266
So because of this low contrast
between the background and the font,

00:30:47.290 --> 00:30:48.700
it's very hard to see.

00:30:49.350 --> 00:30:55.430
And when you actually
look at it in a privacy policy,

00:30:55.430 --> 00:31:00.250
the font is really small,
the contrast is really low,

00:31:00.250 --> 00:31:02.150
so it's very hard
to read for people.

00:31:02.550 --> 00:31:03.990
This is true for anybody, right?

00:31:03.990 --> 00:31:07.150
It's hard to read for people
with disabilities, but it's also hard

00:31:07.150 --> 00:31:09.090
to read for anyone else as well.

00:31:09.090 --> 00:31:12.080
You don't want people to
have to strain their eyes, zoom in

00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:15.700
and zoom out, and go through all of
this to see their privacy information.

00:31:15.700 --> 00:31:20.280
And that's why not just the way
you display the privacy policy link

00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:23.486
is important, but the way
that your privacy policy itself,

00:31:23.510 --> 00:31:27.301
the text appears on your
website, is very important as well.

00:31:29.001 --> 00:31:33.980
<v Hans> So a lot of people have
questions around cookie consent banners,

00:31:33.980 --> 00:31:36.946
and who needs
one in the first place.

00:31:36.970 --> 00:31:40.960
So I think we did discuss earlier
that cookie consent banners required

00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:44.750
under the ePrivacy Directive,
GDPR, which protects residents

00:31:44.750 --> 00:31:48.340
of the EU, the UK Data
Protection Act, Canada's PIPEDA,

00:31:49.030 --> 00:31:51.760
California's CPRA,
and Virginia's VCDPA.

00:31:52.620 --> 00:31:56.020
A cookie consent banner is a
mechanism that allows websites

00:31:56.020 --> 00:32:00.030
to respect your user's privacy
rights by requiring their consent

00:32:00.030 --> 00:32:02.876
to be provided prior to the
application of certain cookies

00:32:02.900 --> 00:32:04.640
being placed on
the user's browser.

00:32:05.250 --> 00:32:07.940
And really, what this means
is if you have, let's say,

00:32:07.940 --> 00:32:11.680
Hotjar analytics, which
is an excellent example

00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:14.826
where you're understanding
how people use your website,

00:32:14.850 --> 00:32:17.236
and there's absolutely
nothing wrong with that.

00:32:17.260 --> 00:32:21.000
But what's important to remind
yourself of is that privacy laws protect

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:25.396
and regulate the ability
to just willy-nilly do that.

00:32:25.420 --> 00:32:30.310
Rather, you have to get consent
first before you can allow Hotjar

00:32:30.310 --> 00:32:34.000
to operate and start analyzing
visitors visiting your website.

00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:37.800
And that's the ePrivacy
Directive, GDPR,

00:32:37.800 --> 00:32:40.000
and the UK Data
Protection Act, and PIPEDA.

00:32:40.610 --> 00:32:44.240
However, CPRA has a
modified cookie consent banner,

00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:47.980
as well as VCDPA, where it is
an opt out of sale of information.

00:32:47.980 --> 00:32:51.276
<v Donata> And to
actually obtain consent.

00:32:51.300 --> 00:32:54.436
So consent is also
a legal term, right?

00:32:54.460 --> 00:32:57.300
So to actually obtain consent,
the user must be presented

00:32:57.300 --> 00:33:00.176
with an accept and
a decline option.

00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:02.736
So that means that you have to
have an option that says accept

00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:04.980
and an option that says
decline, and they both have

00:33:04.980 --> 00:33:06.310
to be equally prominent.

00:33:06.900 --> 00:33:09.470
Now inactivity,
meaning doing nothing,

00:33:09.470 --> 00:33:11.680
does not actually
constitute consent.

00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:15.230
So all of the cookie consent
banners that just say, OK,

00:33:15.230 --> 00:33:18.490
or, By using this website, we
assume that you're OK with cookies,

00:33:18.910 --> 00:33:22.606
that is not actually proper
consent, and that is a violation

00:33:22.630 --> 00:33:23.130
of these laws.

00:33:23.130 --> 00:33:26.610
<v Hans> And these companies
that have been dinged eight figures,

00:33:26.610 --> 00:33:27.306
if I'm not mistaken.

00:33:27.330 --> 00:33:28.250
<v Donata> That's right.
Yes.

00:33:28.650 --> 00:33:30.930
So we'll show you some
examples here as well.

00:33:31.910 --> 00:33:34.040
But what's important
here to remember,

00:33:34.040 --> 00:33:37.870
cookie consent banners must
control all non-essential cookies

00:33:37.870 --> 00:33:40.850
to not fire until the user
provides their consent.

00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:44.220
Now, essential cookies, which
are essential to the operation

00:33:44.220 --> 00:33:46.910
of the website, meaning
that without these cookies,

00:33:46.910 --> 00:33:50.126
the website would break,
those do not need consent.

00:33:50.150 --> 00:33:54.356
However, any marketing or functional
cookies or advertising cookies,

00:33:54.380 --> 00:33:57.660
they cannot fire until the user
provides their actual consent.

00:34:00.510 --> 00:34:02.980
So how to display your
cookie consent banner?

00:34:03.490 --> 00:34:07.470
So here we have a cookie consent
banner that says privacy settings:

00:34:07.470 --> 00:34:10.806
We use third-party website
tracking technologies to provide

00:34:10.830 --> 00:34:13.540
and continually improve your
experience on our website.

00:34:13.950 --> 00:34:16.880
You can revoke or change
your consent at any time.

00:34:17.240 --> 00:34:18.850
It links to a privacy policy.

00:34:18.850 --> 00:34:22.290
It also links to more information,
which leads to a cookie policy.

00:34:22.770 --> 00:34:24.620
Then it has toggle tags.

00:34:24.620 --> 00:34:28.356
So one tag is marketing,
which is turned off.

00:34:28.380 --> 00:34:30.870
Another tag is functional,
which is turned off.

00:34:31.330 --> 00:34:36.306
And another tag is essential, which
is always turned on per regulations.

00:34:36.330 --> 00:34:37.640
So here you can make a choice.

00:34:37.640 --> 00:34:40.976
You can accept all, meaning
that you accept all cookies.

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:42.910
You can toggle
marketing or functional.

00:34:42.910 --> 00:34:45.420
So let's say I only want
functional, I can turn that on.

00:34:45.840 --> 00:34:48.066
I only want marketing,
I can turn that on.

00:34:48.090 --> 00:34:51.700
You can click deny, which means
that no cookies will be turned on

00:34:51.700 --> 00:34:52.730
except essential.

00:34:53.090 --> 00:34:55.120
And then you can
also save your settings.

00:34:55.620 --> 00:34:57.920
Now what's important to
note here is that accept all

00:34:57.920 --> 00:35:00.696
and deny both have
the same prominence.

00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:04.510
So they are both large purple
buttons of the same color

00:35:04.510 --> 00:35:06.336
with the text being in white.

00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:08.900
And that's very important
because you're not tricking the user

00:35:08.900 --> 00:35:09.730
into agreeing.

00:35:10.110 --> 00:35:14.150
So if you had accept all
in green and deny in white,

00:35:14.150 --> 00:35:18.000
let's say, that would be
considered a dark pattern

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:20.170
because it tricks the
user into consenting,

00:35:20.170 --> 00:35:22.120
which is not
actual real consent.

00:35:22.910 --> 00:35:25.990
Then on the right, we have
a purple fingerprint icon.

00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:29.650
So what happens with cookies is
that users have the right to consent

00:35:29.650 --> 00:35:32.800
to cookies, and they also have
the right to withdraw their consent.

00:35:33.160 --> 00:35:36.370
So let's say yesterday I agreed
to a Facebook pixel to track me;

00:35:37.140 --> 00:35:39.390
and today I decide no, I
actually don't want that,

00:35:39.390 --> 00:35:42.196
I have the right to go in
and change my settings.

00:35:42.220 --> 00:35:45.140
So what I do here with this
particular cookie consent banner

00:35:45.140 --> 00:35:48.836
is I will click on the fingerprint
icon, and then I can unselect

00:35:48.860 --> 00:35:52.910
or reselect any cookies that I want
and change my options at any time.

00:35:55.839 --> 00:35:59.010
<v Hans> Now, how not to
display your cookie consent banner,

00:35:59.010 --> 00:36:00.810
and hopefully everyone's
finding this interesting.

00:36:00.810 --> 00:36:04.070
I'll let you know, like, once you
learn this, it becomes interesting going

00:36:04.070 --> 00:36:06.380
to websites and being like,
Oh, you're not compliant.

00:36:06.380 --> 00:36:07.460
<v Donata> It is fun.

00:36:07.940 --> 00:36:11.290
If you are ever bored or
have a hard time falling asleep,

00:36:11.720 --> 00:36:14.350
check out Dark
Patterns Hall of Shame.

00:36:14.890 --> 00:36:18.926
So that's actually a website that
aggregates all of these violations

00:36:18.950 --> 00:36:20.230
and shames companies.

00:36:20.680 --> 00:36:23.930
And there's also really interesting
E-commerce dark patterns,

00:36:23.930 --> 00:36:28.156
which I love looking at of how people
trick people into making a purchase.

00:36:28.180 --> 00:36:31.936
<v Hans> Well, and sure enough,
with this example we have listed here,

00:36:31.960 --> 00:36:35.230
we have what looks to be a
pretty big consent banner saying,

00:36:35.230 --> 00:36:37.250
we care about your privacy,
and going on to distribute it.

00:36:37.250 --> 00:36:38.020
<v Donata> Do you though?

00:36:38.020 --> 00:36:38.160
Do you?

00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:39.765
<v Hans> [chuckles]
Yes, no kidding.

00:36:39.790 --> 00:36:42.640
And then, We and partners
process data to provide

00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:46.710
And they list a bunch of
purposes as why they process data.

00:36:47.380 --> 00:36:51.846
But the problem here is that
we have a big blue I accept button

00:36:51.870 --> 00:36:55.000
that quickly captures
your attention; you want

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:56.750
to just click it almost
right out the gate.

00:36:57.210 --> 00:37:01.260
And then there's show purposes,
which is an underlined hyperlink

00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:05.916
with a white background and just
the word show purposes in blue.

00:37:05.940 --> 00:37:09.576
So it's very clearly drawing your
attention to an I accept button,

00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:14.536
but as we just learned, you need
to have a clear deny option as well.

00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:17.560
You got to remember, certain
privacy laws allow people

00:37:17.560 --> 00:37:20.846
to not be tracked by default,
meaning they have to consent

00:37:20.870 --> 00:37:24.716
to your website first before
you're allowed to start tracking them

00:37:24.740 --> 00:37:27.206
or placing non-essential
cookies on their browsers.

00:37:27.230 --> 00:37:30.620
So this is a deceptive cookie
consent banner because they're trying

00:37:30.620 --> 00:37:33.416
to encourage you to
forfeit your privacy rights

00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:35.340
by clicking that
blue I accept button.

00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:37.150
<v Donata> Yes, and
there's no deny button.

00:37:37.150 --> 00:37:39.450
It's only show purposes,
which is not deny.

00:37:39.450 --> 00:37:42.750
Show purposes is, Show me a
list of why you need these cookies,

00:37:42.750 --> 00:37:43.940
not actually deny them.

00:37:44.530 --> 00:37:47.300
So this is a perfect example
of a non-compliant banner.

00:37:47.300 --> 00:37:51.440
<v Hans> Here we have
another example of how not

00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:53.206
to display your
cookie consent banner.

00:37:53.230 --> 00:37:56.270
So the previous example is
bad, but this one's even worse

00:37:57.140 --> 00:38:02.046
in the sense that this screenshot
is of a giant accept button.

00:38:02.070 --> 00:38:04.760
It says, We need your consent
to set cookies on your device.

00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:06.840
To agree, click ‘accept’ below.

00:38:07.500 --> 00:38:11.810
And the accept button takes
up like 30% of the bottom half

00:38:11.810 --> 00:38:12.350
of this thing.

00:38:12.830 --> 00:38:16.100
Then in the bottom left corner
is a tiny little reject button,

00:38:16.100 --> 00:38:18.660
and then a more information
button in the bottom right corner.

00:38:19.170 --> 00:38:21.870
So this is very clear that the
company is trying to encourage you

00:38:21.870 --> 00:38:24.860
to forfeit your privacy rights in
exchange for them being able

00:38:24.860 --> 00:38:26.270
to track you and so forth.

00:38:26.720 --> 00:38:28.120
And this is the
type of dark patterns

00:38:28.120 --> 00:38:30.440
that have gotten
companies fined significantly.

00:38:30.440 --> 00:38:33.460
<v Donata> Yes, and there's
another two problems here.

00:38:33.460 --> 00:38:37.286
So, again, we blew up this
screenshot so that it'd be easier to see,

00:38:37.310 --> 00:38:41.150
but in real life, the
reject button was tiny.

00:38:41.610 --> 00:38:45.060
So it's definitely not accessible
because the font was not large enough.

00:38:45.460 --> 00:38:48.810
The problem here, too, is We
need your consent to set cookies

00:38:48.810 --> 00:38:49.590
on your device.

00:38:49.950 --> 00:38:52.370
Do you mean you
would like your consent?

00:38:52.850 --> 00:38:56.120
It's almost making you
feel like you have to consent,

00:38:56.120 --> 00:38:57.800
when in reality,
you really don't.

00:38:58.400 --> 00:39:01.180
So there's problems with
the verbiage, and also the way

00:39:01.180 --> 00:39:03.308
that this is set up as well.

00:39:03.858 --> 00:39:06.506
This one is one of my favorites.

00:39:06.530 --> 00:39:09.350
So this one makes it
essentially impossible for a user

00:39:09.350 --> 00:39:12.450
to figure out whether cookies
are actually turned off or on.

00:39:13.020 --> 00:39:16.586
So you have measured ad performance,
measure content performance,

00:39:16.610 --> 00:39:19.950
apply market research, develop
and improve product, store

00:39:19.950 --> 00:39:22.250
and/or access
information on a device.

00:39:22.910 --> 00:39:27.340
And at the top, there's
on in white, and off in gray

00:39:27.340 --> 00:39:28.356
in the right hand column.

00:39:28.380 --> 00:39:34.046
But if you actually click
on, then on becomes blue

00:39:34.070 --> 00:39:35.770
and then off becomes white.

00:39:36.290 --> 00:39:40.390
So it's very unclear as to what
selection I have actually made

00:39:40.390 --> 00:39:43.336
because the colors flip-flop.

00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:46.640
So on one side, on is in
white; in the other it's blue.

00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:48.260
So is it actually on?

00:39:48.260 --> 00:39:49.510
Is it actually off?

00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:54.776
It's very unclear as to how to actually
figure out what is going on here.

00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:56.760
So I think that would
be a really big issue both

00:39:56.760 --> 00:39:59.530
from a privacy perspective,
because you can't understand

00:39:59.530 --> 00:40:03.996
what's turned on or off, and then
also from an accessibility perspective

00:40:04.020 --> 00:40:05.740
as well.

00:40:06.050 --> 00:40:08.410
Now this one is actually
a great one as well.

00:40:08.410 --> 00:40:12.926
It says, We use cookies to offer
you a better browsing experience,

00:40:12.950 --> 00:40:17.240
analyze side traffic, and personalize
content, and serve targeted ads.

00:40:18.090 --> 00:40:20.540
By continuing to browse
the website, you will continue

00:40:20.560 --> 00:40:23.810
to our use cookies, and then
you click continue to browse.

00:40:24.190 --> 00:40:27.870
So this actually does not
obtain any consent whatsoever,

00:40:28.280 --> 00:40:31.030
meaning that this is not
sufficient to establish consent

00:40:31.030 --> 00:40:34.350
under privacy laws because
nonactivity is not sufficient

00:40:34.350 --> 00:40:35.510
to establish consent.

00:40:35.960 --> 00:40:38.280
So these types of banners
definitely need to go.

00:40:38.280 --> 00:40:41.296
We call them placebo banners
because they don't allow user

00:40:41.320 --> 00:40:45.150
any actual choice, and the
cookies are applied to their device,

00:40:45.150 --> 00:40:47.376
regardless of what they
actually choose here.

00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:47.900
<v Hans> Yes.

00:40:47.900 --> 00:40:50.310
And for anyone who's thinking,
I just don't want to comply

00:40:50.310 --> 00:40:51.200
with privacy laws.

00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:53.150
Well, just don't even
have these fake banners.

00:40:53.150 --> 00:40:55.090
Like, just bring people... I mean,
if you're going to track them,

00:40:55.090 --> 00:40:58.080
you're going to track them; you
don't even need a banner then.

00:40:58.080 --> 00:41:00.670
<v Donata> This helps no one.

00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:04.940
Keeping accessibility in mind
with your cooking consent banner.

00:41:04.940 --> 00:41:06.230
Hans, you want to take this one?

00:41:06.230 --> 00:41:08.300
<v Hans> Yes, absolutely.

00:41:08.300 --> 00:41:13.710
For example, when you click
tab, the very first thing that happens

00:41:13.710 --> 00:41:16.360
on the website is you're brought
right into the consent mechanism.

00:41:16.360 --> 00:41:18.280
And that's very common
because you want

00:41:18.280 --> 00:41:21.910
to understand people's consent
choices prior to them interacting

00:41:21.910 --> 00:41:23.090
with the rest of your website.

00:41:23.510 --> 00:41:26.590
This is very common if you have
analytics tools on your website

00:41:26.590 --> 00:41:28.880
where you want to get
consent sooner than later

00:41:28.880 --> 00:41:31.620
so that you can understand how
people interact with your website.

00:41:32.160 --> 00:41:35.266
I always say there's nothing
wrong with collecting analytics data

00:41:35.290 --> 00:41:37.426
or sending targeted
advertisements.

00:41:37.450 --> 00:41:39.280
I love targeted
advertisements personally.

00:41:39.650 --> 00:41:41.196
I know you hate
them, but I love them.

00:41:41.220 --> 00:41:42.560
I love them when
they're relevant to me.

00:41:43.170 --> 00:41:46.266
But what I like as a person
is the ability to choose

00:41:46.290 --> 00:41:47.930
who sends me targeted ads.

00:41:48.770 --> 00:41:52.680
But as you tab through these
options, you're brought to each

00:41:52.680 --> 00:41:54.886
and every section so
that you get a choice,

00:41:54.910 --> 00:41:58.086
whether you are navigating
with a mouse or a screen reader,

00:41:58.110 --> 00:42:01.510
you can choose marketing or
functional cookies, you can choose

00:42:01.510 --> 00:42:02.986
to enable or disable them.

00:42:03.010 --> 00:42:05.410
You can access the privacy
policy or more information

00:42:05.410 --> 00:42:06.440
which are underlined.

00:42:06.820 --> 00:42:09.690
And then you have the clear
safe settings, deny button

00:42:09.690 --> 00:42:11.036
and accept all button.

00:42:11.060 --> 00:42:13.270
And last but not least, you
have the ability just to close out

00:42:13.270 --> 00:42:14.410
in the top right corner.

00:42:14.410 --> 00:42:18.030
So being able to navigate
a consent banner is just

00:42:18.030 --> 00:42:21.296
as essential as ensuring you're
getting consent in the first place,

00:42:21.320 --> 00:42:24.350
because it all comes back to
wanting to ensure people have access

00:42:24.350 --> 00:42:26.240
to your website, and
they have the ability

00:42:26.240 --> 00:42:29.020
to set their privacy preferences
when visiting your website.

00:42:29.020 --> 00:42:31.800
<v Donata> And most cookie
consent providers will state

00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:35.050
on their website whether or
not they're accessibility compliant

00:42:35.050 --> 00:42:39.580
so make sure to keep
an eye out on that as well.

00:42:39.580 --> 00:42:43.990
Obtaining a must draw in consent.
So you need to get a consent

00:42:43.990 --> 00:42:46.950
to email marketing
for many privacy laws,

00:42:47.420 --> 00:42:50.556
and many individuals have the
right to withdraw that consent.

00:42:50.580 --> 00:42:55.416
So consent must be provided in a
way that a consumer can say yes or no,

00:42:55.440 --> 00:42:58.040
and it must not be confusing,
and must be accessible.

00:42:58.510 --> 00:43:01.326
So here you have an email
marketing subscription form,

00:43:01.350 --> 00:43:04.716
and the user must opt out if they
do not want to receive messages

00:43:04.740 --> 00:43:06.340
instead of being
allowed to opt in.

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:09.920
So here it says, choose how
we send you marketing messages.

00:43:09.920 --> 00:43:12.670
Check the box if you don't
want us to tell you about offers,

00:43:12.670 --> 00:43:15.430
rewards, and information
about products or services.

00:43:15.910 --> 00:43:19.850
We'll never share details with anyone
else without your permission. Lie.

00:43:20.290 --> 00:43:24.840
Now, when it comes to privacy
law compliance, most privacy laws

00:43:24.840 --> 00:43:29.030
such as GDPR do require
email marketing to be opt in.

00:43:29.560 --> 00:43:31.650
So you cannot opt
in people by default.

00:43:31.650 --> 00:43:34.460
They must opt in themselves
if they would like to.

00:43:34.900 --> 00:43:37.490
So you need to allow people
to opt in and also allow them

00:43:37.490 --> 00:43:38.520
to opt out as well.

00:43:38.520 --> 00:43:41.480
<v Hans> Yes, this is one of
the most confusing screenshots

00:43:41.480 --> 00:43:44.800
I've ever seen because the
title, choosing how we send you

00:43:44.800 --> 00:43:45.650
marketing messages.

00:43:45.650 --> 00:43:49.156
So I think, Oh, how do I want
to receive marketing messages?

00:43:49.180 --> 00:43:50.570
I should click what
I want to receive.

00:43:50.970 --> 00:43:53.566
But then you read the
second text and it's saying,

00:43:53.590 --> 00:43:55.766
Click what you don't
want us to tell you about.

00:43:55.790 --> 00:43:59.396
Like, oh, every customer must
be super upset with what they offer.

00:43:59.420 --> 00:44:01.820
<v Donata> I would say that
any reasonable consumer here

00:44:01.820 --> 00:44:03.706
would assume
that, If I tick the box,

00:44:03.730 --> 00:44:05.400
that's how I receive
the messages.

00:44:06.400 --> 00:44:09.690
Not, That's how I not
receive messages.

00:44:10.090 --> 00:44:11.710
So it is confusing, for sure.

00:44:11.710 --> 00:44:12.440
<v Hans> Very confusing.

00:44:12.440 --> 00:44:14.550
And we do have to speed
it up a little bit so we can get

00:44:14.550 --> 00:44:15.810
to Q&amp;A to help people out.

00:44:16.250 --> 00:44:21.280
But here is an example of a
very difficult to read screenshot,

00:44:21.780 --> 00:44:26.460
where there's black font, and it's
hard for me to see this currently.

00:44:26.460 --> 00:44:32.410
But there's messaging inside
that is kind of hiding details

00:44:32.410 --> 00:44:34.860
with regard to how to
unsubscribe from emails.

00:44:34.860 --> 00:44:35.450
<v Donata> Right.

00:44:35.450 --> 00:44:39.316
So it says click here to
unsubscribe. And I only know this

00:44:39.340 --> 00:44:42.626
because I zoomed into this
and stared for like 10 minutes.

00:44:42.650 --> 00:44:43.980
But the here is underlined.

00:44:44.870 --> 00:44:47.080
Basically you cannot see it.

00:44:47.080 --> 00:44:48.110
Nobody can see it.

00:44:48.110 --> 00:44:49.536
It's extremely deceptive.

00:44:49.560 --> 00:44:52.710
It's in violation of privacy
laws, and also in violation

00:44:52.710 --> 00:44:57.066
of accessibility laws as the
unsubscribe link is essentially invisible.

00:44:57.090 --> 00:44:59.630
So on your email marketing,
make sure that click here

00:44:59.630 --> 00:45:01.780
to unsubscribe is very visible.

00:45:01.780 --> 00:45:04.320
<v Hans> And just as an
average consumer, you know,

00:45:05.730 --> 00:45:08.620
we see companies do this
these days, and it just is, like,

00:45:08.620 --> 00:45:12.630
Oh, this company shady.
Like, they lose credibility

00:45:12.630 --> 00:45:15.040
when you do these
types of dark patterns.

00:45:15.040 --> 00:45:15.920
<v Donata> Absolutely.

00:45:15.920 --> 00:45:19.510
<v Hans> Here's another
consent banner, which yet again,

00:45:19.920 --> 00:45:23.296
has a giant confirm
button to subscribe.

00:45:23.320 --> 00:45:24.810
Oh, sorry, this isn't
a consent banner.

00:45:24.810 --> 00:45:27.606
This is the option to
subscribe to a newsletter,

00:45:27.630 --> 00:45:31.746
where you have this giant red
confirm button with white text,

00:45:31.770 --> 00:45:34.840
and then you have this tiny
little no button Probably a button,

00:45:34.840 --> 00:45:37.710
but it looks like just behind
this black background,

00:45:37.710 --> 00:45:40.330
just as in red, small
text, the word no.

00:45:41.050 --> 00:45:44.520
Yet again, this is encouraging
customers to have their data be sent off

00:45:44.520 --> 00:45:45.616
to another vendor.

00:45:45.640 --> 00:45:48.336
And granted, this company
probably shares data

00:45:48.360 --> 00:45:51.866
with their email marketing provider
like MailChimp or Constant Contact.

00:45:51.890 --> 00:45:53.980
They're going to send the
email to that third-party company

00:45:54.370 --> 00:45:56.200
and that is, yet again,
a deceptive practice.

00:45:56.200 --> 00:45:57.170
<v Donata> Right.

00:45:57.170 --> 00:46:01.300
Because the confirm is so
visible in red, and the no is so small

00:46:01.300 --> 00:46:04.730
and so invisible that people
will automatically click confirm.

00:46:06.180 --> 00:46:07.886
Here's an E-commerce form.

00:46:07.910 --> 00:46:13.400
On the left side, you'll see
basket, vehicle, check, 1499.

00:46:13.400 --> 00:46:16.500
And at the bottom, there's a
pre-checked box that says I've read

00:46:16.500 --> 00:46:18.636
and understood to the
terms and conditions.

00:46:18.660 --> 00:46:21.170
And then it says
more info. So actually,

00:46:21.170 --> 00:46:25.030
if you click more info here, you'll
see by submitting your details

00:46:25.030 --> 00:46:28.500
and your consent, you will get
email newsletters from the company

00:46:28.500 --> 00:46:31.890
and also from their
carefully selected partners.

00:46:32.330 --> 00:46:35.246
So I have read and understood
the terms and conditions,

00:46:35.270 --> 00:46:38.520
that has no notice to the
individual that this is actually

00:46:38.520 --> 00:46:39.900
affecting their privacy.

00:46:40.350 --> 00:46:42.746
Both of these boxes
are pre-checked.

00:46:42.770 --> 00:46:45.380
All of the information
is hidden to somewhere

00:46:45.380 --> 00:46:47.140
where a user
wouldn't normally click.

00:46:47.140 --> 00:46:50.360
So it's not compliant with
privacy laws, as it tricks people

00:46:50.360 --> 00:46:53.100
into not reading the
relevant privacy information,

00:46:53.530 --> 00:46:55.756
and also has a
pre-check consent box.

00:46:55.780 --> 00:46:57.460
<v Hans> And we
have eight slides to go.

00:46:57.460 --> 00:46:59.610
I think we should average
about 30 seconds of slides

00:46:59.610 --> 00:47:01.710
so that we can get a
little Q&amp;A going on here.

00:47:01.710 --> 00:47:03.360
So, yes, go ahead.

00:47:03.360 --> 00:47:05.970
<v Donata> A dark pattern, which
is what we've been showing you

00:47:05.970 --> 00:47:10.036
is a user interface that has been
crafted to trick users into taking

00:47:10.060 --> 00:47:12.130
or not taking certain actions.

00:47:12.710 --> 00:47:14.366
Here’s another example.

00:47:14.390 --> 00:47:15.860
So Let’s get you connected.

00:47:15.860 --> 00:47:19.480
So to get 500 megabytes to
user in the next seven days

00:47:20.050 --> 00:47:23.040
at hotspots, you can
register again at seven days.

00:47:23.040 --> 00:47:27.086
So it has a box and says, Yes, I
want to receive offers and promotions.

00:47:27.110 --> 00:47:30.570
I can unsubscribe at any
time. But what's interesting

00:47:30.570 --> 00:47:34.290
about this is that you
are required to subscribe

00:47:34.290 --> 00:47:38.016
to receive email marketing and
promotions from this company

00:47:38.040 --> 00:47:41.070
and everybody else to
actually connect to this.

00:47:41.710 --> 00:47:43.826
That is not necessary, right?

00:47:43.850 --> 00:47:46.820
And it's not necessary to
share your data with other people

00:47:46.820 --> 00:47:48.650
to be able to
receive the service.

00:47:49.200 --> 00:47:54.566
So don't preface consent
with a requirement.

00:47:54.590 --> 00:47:56.650
Don't force people to consent.

00:47:56.650 --> 00:47:58.160
Make it an actual choice.

00:47:59.220 --> 00:48:01.746
Here.
So Wait, don't go yet.

00:48:01.770 --> 00:48:05.040
Use $20 off your
$40 styling fee.

00:48:05.040 --> 00:48:08.030
You enter your email
address and click ‘get started’.

00:48:08.030 --> 00:48:11.756
And at the bottom it says, No,
thanks, I don't want to look my best.

00:48:11.780 --> 00:48:15.140
So they're basically shaming you
and saying that you would rather

00:48:15.140 --> 00:48:19.870
be ugly and wear hideous
clothes than give something up

00:48:19.870 --> 00:48:22.186
as easy as your email address.

00:48:22.210 --> 00:48:24.086
It has no privacy information.

00:48:24.110 --> 00:48:27.910
It's likely used for marketing,
shared with third parties or even sold.

00:48:28.460 --> 00:48:31.306
Even this No, thanks, I
don't want to look my best,

00:48:31.330 --> 00:48:33.770
it also does not mean
accessibility standards,

00:48:33.770 --> 00:48:35.980
as the no thanks
font is too small.

00:48:36.610 --> 00:48:38.330
<v Laura> Well,
thank you very much.

00:48:38.330 --> 00:48:39.820
We're out of time.

00:48:39.820 --> 00:48:45.110
Yes, unfortunately,
our time is up at 6:50.

00:48:45.880 --> 00:48:48.790
We probably have time
for one of the questions,

00:48:49.200 --> 00:48:50.760
if we can hit that real quick.

00:48:51.140 --> 00:48:54.880
But if you can look at the
questions before you leave,

00:48:54.880 --> 00:49:02.776
and then maybe answer them in
the chat area or something like that.

00:49:02.800 --> 00:49:04.586
Are your slides
going to be available?

00:49:04.610 --> 00:49:05.700
<v Hans> Yes.

00:49:05.700 --> 00:49:08.230
And so we have three
more dark pattern examples.

00:49:08.230 --> 00:49:10.360
But then the final
one, we have four tips

00:49:10.360 --> 00:49:11.840
that I think are really
good takeaways.

00:49:12.900 --> 00:49:16.110
We can add a link into the chat
here so that everyone can read the tips

00:49:16.206 --> 00:49:20.190
at their own time here.

00:49:21.070 --> 00:49:23.780
Laura, you would like
us to pick a question?

00:49:24.760 --> 00:49:26.740
<v Laura> No, I was
going through them.

00:49:27.360 --> 00:49:28.586
<v Hans> OK.

00:49:28.610 --> 00:49:33.246
<v Laura> Anonymous asked: Can
we use a global legal policies footer link

00:49:33.270 --> 00:49:39.766
to a mini-site map page of all
policies for sites that have many.

00:49:39.790 --> 00:49:43.176
I've seen this before on
sites with six-plus policies

00:49:43.200 --> 00:49:48.160
they clearly needed legally, but
wasn't sure that was acceptable.

00:49:48.520 --> 00:49:52.950
<v Hans> OK, so as I understand
that ,basically this individual has a ton

00:49:52.950 --> 00:49:57.720
of websites and, Can I
standardize my policies by explaining

00:49:58.090 --> 00:50:02.670
in one policy and have it
represent multiple sites? Technically,

00:50:02.670 --> 00:50:05.520
it's possible, but every
single website needs

00:50:05.520 --> 00:50:08.030
to be collecting the exact
same personal information,

00:50:08.030 --> 00:50:10.436
sharing it with the same
parties, and so forth.

00:50:10.460 --> 00:50:13.800
So if they are all basically
mirror-copy websites,

00:50:13.820 --> 00:50:16.460
having the exact same
functionality, collecting the same

00:50:16.460 --> 00:50:20.086
as that personal information, and
sharing it with the exact same parties,

00:50:20.110 --> 00:50:23.366
and has all the same privacy
practices, then yes, you can do it.

00:50:23.390 --> 00:50:26.640
However that tends to be
very rare, and it could create

00:50:26.640 --> 00:50:28.096
customer confusion.

00:50:28.120 --> 00:50:30.010
So I would say that the
high-level answer, so long

00:50:30.010 --> 00:50:32.720
as it doesn't create customer
confusion, then yes, it is possible.

00:50:32.720 --> 00:50:36.560
<v Donata> But any link to the
policy should include the word privacy.

00:50:36.560 --> 00:50:40.890
So if you have policies, at
least put privacy in parentheses

00:50:40.890 --> 00:50:41.700
or something like that.

00:50:41.700 --> 00:50:44.230
<v Laura> Well,
thank you so much.

00:50:44.750 --> 00:50:48.160
This is one of those things,
the legal stuff, that scares me.

00:50:48.760 --> 00:50:53.280
So you guys make it a little
bit easier, and I appreciate that.

00:50:53.810 --> 00:50:57.556
Like I said, we can continue
the conversation in the chat

00:50:57.580 --> 00:51:08.716
or on social media using
#WPA11YDAY and #WPAD2023.

00:51:08.740 --> 00:51:18.375
We also would appreciate if you go
to 2023.wpaccessibility.da/feedback

00:51:18.400 --> 00:51:22.770

our speakers on their presentation,

00:51:22.770 --> 00:51:25.860
