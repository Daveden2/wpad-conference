<v Amber Hinds> WordPress
Accessibility Day 2023.

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:07.660
Complex Data Visualizations and
the Accessibility Phenomena,

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:12.260
with speaker Merary Alvarado,
accessibility specialist,

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:14.720
Alinea Consulting Services.

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:18.450
This presentation was
recorded September 27th, 2023.

00:00:19.367 --> 00:00:20.810
<v Ben Ogilvie> Hey, everyone.

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:24.540
Welcome or welcome back to
WordPress Accessibility Day 2023.

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:27.950
I'm Ben Ogilvie,
head of accessibility at ArcTouch.

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:31.320
We help companies of all sizes
create lovable custom apps, websites,

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.640
and connected experiences
used by hundreds of millions

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.640
of people every day; and I
help our teams do that work

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.080
with an accessibility-first
approach.

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:42.800
Thank you all so much for joining
us for Complex Data Visualizations

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.360
and the Accessibility
Phenomena, with Merary Alvarado.

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.420
Merary is an accessibility
evangelist with more than 12 years

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.000
of proven experience in

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.450
and leading accessibility processes
in multiple digital industries.

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:58.800
She's a subject matter expert
who contributes to accessibility

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.250
by establishing guidelines,
best practices, and standards related

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.500
to designing and maintaining
accessible websites, native apps,

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.340
and data visualization.

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.610
She trains clients on using
accessibility-monitoring software,

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.240
and assists in identifying
strategies and solutions focused

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:14.510
on accessibility.

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:18.680
She's a podcaster, speaker,
pet lover, and passionate about data.

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:21.990
During this session today,
please add your questions

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.523
to the Zoom Q&A section
and we'll answer them

00:01:24.524 --> 00:01:26.010
at the end of the session.

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:29.500
And you can also use the chat section
to connect with other attendees.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.260
With that,
I'll hand over to Merary.

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.820
<v Merary Alvarado> Hey,
Ben, thank you so much.

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:36.710
And thank you so much for joining.

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.680
I'm really happy to be here,
and to share with you the information

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.700
that I’ve prepared based on
the best practices that I know

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.030
of this area.

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:51.280
I would really love if you can
confirm that you can see the content

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:52.280
of my screen.

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.890
Also, if you are able to check
the information, that's great.

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.420
Thank you so much.

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.710
So many good signs.

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.310
OK, so talking about accessibility.

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.330
When we talk about complex
data visualization,

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.440
we need to understand several
things, right?

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.770
Let's think about this.

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:17.760
When we talk about
data visualizations,

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.740
what is usually your
thoughts about it?

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.200
So we think about two ways.

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.670
We collect the information
that we have about Instagrams,

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:34.890
bar charts, like,
multiple visualizations.

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.630
And the other point that we usually
think about is the audience,

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:44.000
the type of audience that is
usually accessing this information.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.200
It's usually highly-technical
profile roles, right?

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:54.340
Or those are economists or
mathematicians or, like,

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.190
scientific researchers, right?

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.650
So when we think about that,
we say, OK, so the information

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:05.150
that we need to add or we need
to create, probably people

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:09.670
with disabilities cannot use
that, right? And I'm saying that

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:13.720
because in my experience,
I’ve heard that before, OK?

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.330
It's not just what I think, right?

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:20.800
So it's important to understand
that there are the type of questions

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.580
or comments [Inaudible 00:03:21]

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:26.810
with accessibility all the time.

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:29.070
One of the first topics
that I would like to share

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:34.480
with you is always talking about
accessibility as a human right.

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.730
Why is this important to mention?

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:41.820
Maybe people that is also involved
in my previous presentations...

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:44.010
I always talk about this topic.

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:50.820
Because we cannot start creating
digital accessibility spaces

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:55.410
or digital products without
thinking about accessibility

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:56.880
as a human right.

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.660
Why is this important to
keep into consideration?

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:04.590
Because we can create opportunities
for people to live their life

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:05.890
as they need, right?

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:11.170
We are creating opportunities
for people to be informed

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:14.780
or get some training
or obtain a new job.

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:20.490
We don't know that, but if we can
create spaces that are accessible

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:25.780
and also really well designed
for multiple disabilities,

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:28.670
and of course for all the users
that will access your content,

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:31.620
that is the best.

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:34.810
Another point that is important
to discuss is like something

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:35.570
we are doing today.

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:36.740
What are we doing today?

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:38.350
We are having a conversation.

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:45.220
We are talking to people who
are interested in learning

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:49.020
and creating a community
[Inaudible 00:04:48]

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:51.130
create digitally
accessible products.

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:56.470
The other point that I would like
to mention is the opportunity

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:59.190
to create digital
accessible services.

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:00.880
And let us think about that.

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:04.510
So we are professionals,
we know our thing, right?

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:06.080
We know what we need to do.

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:10.720
We are good designers, we are
good developers, project managers,

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:11.860
et cetera.

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:16.450
But sometimes we forget that we
also need to follow certain laws,

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:19.190
standards,
et cetera around the world

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:21.090
in order to create
our sites accessible.

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:28.260
Finally, sometimes we have a
few debates with the design team

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.390
or with a few designers
where they say,

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:33.900
No, it’s because
accessibility is an ugly thing

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:36.680
that we can just apply on our site.

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:37.510
But it is not.

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:39.280
It's a myth, right?

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:43.510
But we need to be completely
clear that we can create

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:49.920
usable accessibility spaces,
or usable [Inaudible 00:05:46].

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:54.280
OK, so we are also going to
talk about two important things.

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:59.790
Please don't forget that when we
are talking about accessibility

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:05.910
or digital accessibility, we cannot
dismiss the specific language

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:09.610
that is required to
create our content, OK?

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:13.460
So that's why it's important
to understand about disability.

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:18.400
Disability is something
that everyone has.

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:19.570
Everyone.

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:23.420
It's not something that you need
to weigh when you get older.

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:25.910
No, it's something that
is always in our life.

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:29.540
This is something that is normal,
but actually is not something

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:33.660
that we talk about much,
and it's important to discuss.

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:34.660
There are two important points.

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:39.760
First point is that there are
common internet disabilities.

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:45.200
So for example, vision, cognitive
disabilities, hearing impairments,

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:47.040
reduces mobility.

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:52.300
Those are the most common disability
that we can find statistically

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:55.580
on the internet that
we need to think about,

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:58.230
even when we start
planning our projects.

00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:00.640
It's not when we are
on the testing part.

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:05.240
It's when we start to creating
the ideas or generating the ideas

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:06.820
to create our project.

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:09.880
Next, of course, is the
dimensions of these disabilities.

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:15.470
Some of them could be an impairment,
which is specifically related

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:18.270
to a composition of
the body of a person,

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:23.210
or if a person is not able
to memorize the information

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:30.240
in the fastest ways possible
or they will be lost.

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:33.760
And, of course, some types of
restrictions of participation;

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:35.110
for example, physical space.

00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:39.250
So why should we always try
to do this at the beginning

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:40.340
of our conversations?

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:43.710
It’s because we cannot forget
that when we are talking

00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:47.210
about accessibility,
we are talking about people.

00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:51.350
We are not talking only about
the patches that I’m adding

00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:55.810
in the code with an Aria
attribute or with a label,

00:07:55.810 --> 00:07:56.970
and that would be enough.

00:07:56.970 --> 00:07:59.110
No, we are talking
about something else.

00:07:59.110 --> 00:08:03.050
Accessibility is a way
of living for many users,

00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:06.130
so that's why it's important
for us to understand that, OK?

00:08:06.130 --> 00:08:09.990
So based on that, I would like
to refer to two concepts that,

00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:13.480
for me, are really important in
order to review the best practices

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:17.280
that we want to share today
about the visualizations.

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:19.730
One of these is the
concept of usability.

00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:22.970
When we are talking about
usability and accessibility,

00:08:22.970 --> 00:08:25.970
we think that they are
separate, right?

00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:30.670
And one is one thing and
the other is another thing,

00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:33.410
but actually it’s not; it's
completely the opposite.

00:08:35.830 --> 00:08:40.700
[Inaudible 00:08:34],
we are talking about effectiveness.

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:44.530
We are talking about how the
product is created in the way

00:08:44.530 --> 00:08:49.530
that is meeting with the needs that
I have as a user in this specific

00:08:49.530 --> 00:08:51.120
or particular product.

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:54.176
And when we're talking
about accessibility,

00:08:54.177 --> 00:08:56.120
we are talking specifically

00:08:56.120 --> 00:09:03.310
in the way, How can I definitely
test if my page is really usable

00:09:03.310 --> 00:09:08.860
when we are not using the
common patterns of navigation

00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:10.138
or interaction?

00:09:10.139 --> 00:09:13.970
For example, navigating the
page using a screen reader,

00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:18.710
or navigating the page
using a keyboard alone,

00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:23.420
or using magnification
tools, or a braille display.

00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:29.740
So how usable is my site when
I need to use external devices

00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:31.530
or assistive technologies?

00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:34.900
Is it still usable in the
way that I think it's usable?

00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:38.033
So that's why it's important.

00:09:38.033 --> 00:09:38.760
[Inaudible 00:09:38]

00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:40.230
prepare for you.

00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:43.780
Talking about usability,
this is the ability of the user

00:09:43.780 --> 00:09:48.880
to navigate the page, understand
the page, recover from errors,

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:52.257
understand the content,
and also understand

00:09:52.258 --> 00:09:54.560
that everything is intuitive,

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:55.720
OK?

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:58.400
When we are talking
about accessibility,

00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:02.390
we are talking about keyboard
navigation, screen-reader users,

00:10:02.390 --> 00:10:06.440
magnification tools, and all the
tools that would be necessary

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:09.270
for people with disabilities
to access the content.

00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:16.630
OK, so everything that I’ve
said is really important.

00:10:16.630 --> 00:10:19.380
It's like a small
summary about that.

00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:23.070
So [Inaudible 00:10:20],
so I don't need any more.

00:10:23.070 --> 00:10:27.471
In this case,
what is data visualization meant

00:10:27.472 --> 00:10:30.000
to do in our conversation?

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.546
When we think about
data visualization,

00:10:33.547 --> 00:10:35.940
one of the first questions

00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:41.580
that I usually try to just
moderate when we want to work

00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:47.110
with designers or we developers
is [Inaudible 00:10:46]

00:10:47.110 --> 00:10:49.590
our users are going
to do with this?

00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:53.320
What would be the type of
decisions they need to take

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:55.850
when we are creating
visualizations?

00:10:55.850 --> 00:11:01.390
Sometimes we think that we can create
the most beautiful visualization,

00:11:01.390 --> 00:11:04.730
but in general,
it's not useful enough.

00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:11.030
Or the lack of concepts that
are clear, it's really difficult

00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:12.450
to understand.

00:11:12.450 --> 00:11:17.110
And of course, how are we
going to make this accessible?

00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:24.780
Sometimes we think, OK, Merary,
but how much is the percentage

00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:28.950
of people with disabilities
that will use our system?

00:11:28.950 --> 00:11:31.960
And I was, like, Oh, my
God, this is not a question

00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:36.170
that I really like to answer,
and I will not answer anyways.

00:11:36.170 --> 00:11:39.760
But we need to think,
when we are creating content,

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:42.610
that this content
needs to be accessible

00:11:42.610 --> 00:11:45.640
even if only one person
will access the product

00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:50.240
or 1000 user will use our product.

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:52.300
So we always need
to think about that.

00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:56.930
But always think about, What is
the purpose of the visualization?

00:11:56.930 --> 00:12:00.760
Is it possible to create an
accessible visualization?

00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:05.200
This is the second most important
question that you need to ask.

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:11.550
OK, so what are the most common
barriers that we can find

00:12:11.550 --> 00:12:16.820
or we can face when we are
navigating or creating visualizations

00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:18.220
in terms of accessibility?

00:12:19.510 --> 00:12:22.940
Sometimes we say OK,
we're talking about visualizations;

00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:26.840
of course we need to
prioritize the visual part.

00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:33.970
But sometimes we prioritize
that so much that the navigation

00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:38.640
or understandability of the
graphic, it's impossible.

00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:43.870
So visually, it's beautiful,
it's presentable, but it's difficult

00:12:43.870 --> 00:12:47.770
to understand, it's difficult
to use and make decisions,

00:12:47.770 --> 00:12:50.340
and, of course,
it’s difficult to navigate.

00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:54.960
And sometimes it's lacking of a lot
of context, so it's not possible

00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:56.580
to understand.

00:12:56.580 --> 00:12:59.700
On the other side,
we have the color schemes.

00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:00.520
What is that?

00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:05.890
Sometimes we have beautiful colors,
and we have all the rainbow there,

00:13:05.890 --> 00:13:06.710
right?

00:13:06.710 --> 00:13:11.680
And we create a graphic not
in a specific set of colors.

00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:16.470
So we can add all the color that I
have available without restriction.

00:13:16.470 --> 00:13:20.320
There is not a pattern or
there is not a specific set

00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:26.100
or matrix using colors, so the user
is able to customize everything

00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:27.300
as they want.

00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:30.000
One of the things that I would
like to mention with this is that,

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.260
in one of the previous companies
that I had, they gave the power

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:37.690
to the users to
customize everything.

00:13:37.690 --> 00:13:41.460
So one of the biggest
challenges they had is that,

00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:46.630
How can we just restrict a
little bit more the customization

00:13:46.630 --> 00:13:50.490
in the way that when they
are creating the content,

00:13:50.490 --> 00:13:54.560
they also create
accessible customizations?

00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:58.240
So that's why it's necessary to
create a specific set of tools

00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:00.960
that we are going to
share today with you.

00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:03.120
Another thing, of course,
is the navigation.

00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:07.400
So we need to think about
multiple ways of interaction

00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:09.970
when we are navigating
with our visualizations.

00:14:09.970 --> 00:14:12.440
We need to think about
keyword navigation.

00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:17.600
It's not the same to navigate
our page using a laptop

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:23.640
or desktop keyboard,
or using the mouse with a keyword,

00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:28.060
or just using the keyword
itself and just the mouse pad

00:14:28.060 --> 00:14:29.680
from our laptop.

00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:32.930
All the interactions are
different, and that's why we need

00:14:32.930 --> 00:14:36.970
to understand what will also
be the way that the users needs

00:14:36.970 --> 00:14:39.400
to interact with our page.

00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:40.710
So those are the most common.

00:14:40.710 --> 00:14:45.830
So it's the use of colors and also
the way that the users navigate

00:14:45.830 --> 00:14:47.420
or interacts with the pages.

00:14:47.420 --> 00:14:51.619
And of course,
when the prioritization

00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:54.310
of the visual components

00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:55.520
or [Inaudible 00:14:54]

00:14:59.530 --> 00:15:02.170
the presentation is the
priority, [Inaudible 00:15:01]

00:15:02.170 --> 00:15:03.170
clear context.

00:15:03.930 --> 00:15:10.320
So what are the best practices
that we can just find for today

00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:12.450
and we can share with you?

00:15:12.450 --> 00:15:16.490
One of the best practices that
I can share with you today is

00:15:16.490 --> 00:15:20.230
that you need to humanize the data.

00:15:20.230 --> 00:15:23.070
What is the meaning of that?

00:15:23.070 --> 00:15:27.820
Think about what will be
the value that we can find

00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:31.320
or we can obtain from
this visualization.

00:15:34.290 --> 00:15:38.760
That I need to make in order
to use the information.

00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:45.050
What will be the specific situation
that I need to review with this?

00:15:45.050 --> 00:15:50.010
So always try to create
the data in a way

00:15:50.010 --> 00:15:53.820
that the user will be
able to understand.

00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:59.860
Also, try to create the content in
a way that will be intuitive, right?

00:15:59.860 --> 00:16:01.500
Intuitive for the users.

00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:02.500
Why is this important?

00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:07.240
Because when we need to make
decisions, there are times of the day

00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:11.100
that we can just make a decision,
and sometimes there is not.

00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:15.630
For example, if we have multiple
meetings during the morning

00:16:15.630 --> 00:16:18.430
and during the afternoon,
I need to make a decision

00:16:18.430 --> 00:16:23.550
and I need to go to a specific
visualization, and I'm exhausted

00:16:23.550 --> 00:16:25.820
because I had a lot of meetings.

00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:31.030
There’s a cognitive load there
that probably can not help me

00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:34.669
to create great data or
make decisions correctly

00:16:34.670 --> 00:16:36.080
because I'm tired.

00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:39.240
This is something that is
also necessary to think about.

00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:43.690
Mental health, invisible disabilities
is something that is important

00:16:43.690 --> 00:16:45.450
when we are talking about data.

00:16:45.450 --> 00:16:48.130
So first step, humanize the data.

00:16:49.650 --> 00:16:54.040
The second point is
assistive-technology interaction.

00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:56.090
What is the meaning of that?

00:16:56.090 --> 00:17:00.330
So we need to be completely
conscious about the use

00:17:00.330 --> 00:17:02.290
of assistive technology.

00:17:02.290 --> 00:17:06.308
If you want to start
working with accessibility

00:17:06.309 --> 00:17:08.400
and you are a developer,

00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:14.180
or tester, designer,
project manager who definitely wants

00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:18.660
to start working with accessibility,
I really recommend you

00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:24.980
to start learning about
how to use a screen reader.

00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:26.090
Why is this important?

00:17:26.090 --> 00:17:29.310
Because every screen
reader is different

00:17:29.310 --> 00:17:34.370
and every browser versus the
screen reader is also different.

00:17:34.370 --> 00:17:38.040
The shortcuts are different
to access all the information

00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:39.180
from the screen readers.

00:17:40.790 --> 00:17:44.340
So that's why it's necessary for
you to understand the variations.

00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:46.010
Let me give you an example.

00:17:46.010 --> 00:17:52.880
If you want to use Edge as part of
the support browser from your system,

00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:56.810
you need to understand that the
best screen reader will be JAWS.

00:17:57.990 --> 00:18:02.350
In the case of Chrome,
the best screen reader will be NVDA,

00:18:02.350 --> 00:18:04.130
and those are for Windows.

00:18:04.130 --> 00:18:08.983
But what is going on if you need
to test your product in Safari,

00:18:08.984 --> 00:18:10.600
on a Mac?

00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:12.040
What will be the screen reader?

00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:14.150
That will be Voiceover.

00:18:14.150 --> 00:18:17.200
Although, in this case, we are
talking about desktop environments.

00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:20.820
But what is going on if we
need to test our devices?

00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:25.720
So if we want to test our
products in Android, we need

00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:29.530
to get familiar with TalkBack,
which is the screen reader

00:18:29.530 --> 00:18:32.400
that is by default on
the operating system.

00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:36.700
Same case with Apple
devices, Voiceover.

00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:42.240
So it's really necessary to
understand why this is important.

00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:43.890
Why am I saying that?

00:18:43.890 --> 00:18:49.180
Because you will have multiple
components and interactions.

00:18:49.180 --> 00:18:52.070
For example,
if you are creating a website

00:18:52.070 --> 00:18:59.100
and you are using HTML5
components, usually,

00:18:59.100 --> 00:19:05.970
the screen readers are able to
identify those controls or components

00:19:05.970 --> 00:19:06.870
without any problem.

00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:09.870
That's why we are calling this
part accessibility supportive.

00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:18.880
Usually, all the native HTML5
controls are, 90% of the time,

00:19:20.090 --> 00:19:23.980
accessible by the
screen reader alone.

00:19:23.980 --> 00:19:27.630
But what happens when you
customize a component,

00:19:27.630 --> 00:19:31.790
and this component is not
including all the attributes

00:19:31.790 --> 00:19:36.230
to allow the screen reader
to understand your content?

00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:39.980
That's why it's necessary
to always keep in mind

00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:43.720
what will be the best way
to create our elements,

00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:46.810
or when we are creating
our visualizations.

00:19:46.810 --> 00:19:51.230
What will be the type of
components that we want to create?

00:19:51.230 --> 00:19:54.510
Is the user familiar
with those controls?

00:19:54.510 --> 00:19:58.480
For example, drop-down menus,
radio groups, checkboxes;

00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:01.410
all of those are really
familiar for users.

00:20:01.410 --> 00:20:04.810
But what is going on if you
need to create a specific

00:20:04.810 --> 00:20:06.580
and different interaction

00:20:06.581 --> 00:20:10.120
that probably the user
needs to take 10 seconds,

00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:14.480
one minute to think
about in order to use it?

00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:18.400
Another point that I would
like to mention is, the way

00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:22.181
that this element
needs to be created,

00:20:22.182 --> 00:20:25.090
you need to think about that.

00:20:25.090 --> 00:20:29.810
We have a page, and we have a
banner, we have drop-down options,

00:20:29.810 --> 00:20:31.860
we have checkboxes.

00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:37.580
And visually presented, when we
are using CSS best practices,

00:20:37.580 --> 00:20:39.200
the content looks beautiful.

00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:46.020
But what happens when the content
itself is not properly ordered

00:20:46.020 --> 00:20:48.920
or is not properly organized?

00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:53.310
The screen reader will not be
able to understand the structure

00:20:53.310 --> 00:20:54.440
of the page.

00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:57.360
So that's why it's really
important for me to share

00:20:57.360 --> 00:21:00.340
with you the Accessibility
Tree concept.

00:21:00.340 --> 00:21:03.890
In this case, you will be
able to understand what would

00:21:03.890 --> 00:21:08.100
be the way your content can be
accessed by using a screen reader.

00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:13.290
For example, on the screen, I have
a screenshot of an horizon beach.

00:21:13.290 --> 00:21:19.150
And as part of the Chrome
options, you can find a small icon

00:21:19.150 --> 00:21:24.370
at the top-right side of the
screenshot that is a small icon,

00:21:25.580 --> 00:21:30.120
like, it’s simulates as a
person, and you can enable that.

00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:35.520
So immediately,
you can convert your code in the way

00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:38.800
that the screen reader
will read your information.

00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:42.850
So you will immediately know
what would be the best way

00:21:42.850 --> 00:21:45.490
that the user can
access our content.

00:21:45.490 --> 00:21:50.310
Now you can just double check
the code, change the components,

00:21:50.310 --> 00:21:54.860
the order of the elements,
add additional attributes or roles

00:21:54.860 --> 00:21:58.070
that can help the screen reader
user to understand the content

00:21:58.070 --> 00:22:01.150
in a logical and meaningful way.

00:22:01.150 --> 00:22:03.350
So that is really,
really important, OK?

00:22:06.110 --> 00:22:10.210
Another point that is really
interesting for me to know,

00:22:10.210 --> 00:22:16.830
because it is one of the most
complicated and most common defects

00:22:16.830 --> 00:22:19.661
when we are navigating
visualizations,

00:22:19.662 --> 00:22:21.330
is the use of keyword.

00:22:21.330 --> 00:22:22.440
What is that?

00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:27.970
We usually get used to navigating
our pages using the mouse

00:22:27.970 --> 00:22:29.850
because it's the best way.

00:22:29.850 --> 00:22:36.590
In the past when I had some
reviews with designers,

00:22:36.590 --> 00:22:39.720
we usually proceed
with a few exercises.

00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:46.800
So how much time do you take to go
to a specific main navigation menu

00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:47.840
using the mouse?

00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:50.480
Three seconds, five seconds.

00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:55.130
What will be the average time
navigating the same navigation menu

00:22:55.130 --> 00:22:58.530
using your keyboard alone?

00:22:58.530 --> 00:23:00.200
Would that will be the same?

00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:01.200
Definitely not, right?

00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:04.530
So you could take two
minutes, three minutes.

00:23:04.530 --> 00:23:05.530
And [Inaudible 00:23:05].

00:23:06.340 --> 00:23:11.580
The main navigation menu
have a lot of options,

00:23:11.580 --> 00:23:15.190
so it will be really difficult
and time consuming for the user

00:23:15.190 --> 00:23:17.370
to navigate the content.

00:23:17.370 --> 00:23:19.380
So that's why it's
really important for you

00:23:19.380 --> 00:23:23.290
to understand that
[Inaudible 00:23:20]

00:23:23.290 --> 00:23:25.540
on the selection of the components.

00:23:25.540 --> 00:23:27.670
And you need to create
custom [Inaudible 00:23:27]

00:23:27.670 --> 00:23:30.020
components; it's also important.

00:23:30.020 --> 00:23:35.830
When you create filters, or when you
create horizontal navigation menus,

00:23:35.830 --> 00:23:39.290
all these things needs to
have a specific strategy

00:23:39.290 --> 00:23:41.390
or keyboard interaction strategy.

00:23:41.390 --> 00:23:46.110
So you can create visual
guidelines to indicate to the user

00:23:46.110 --> 00:23:48.720
what will be the shortcuts,
for example, to access

00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:52.580
to the horizontal toolbar
or the horizontal menu bar?

00:23:52.580 --> 00:23:58.630
So what would be another two
points that you need to consider

00:23:58.630 --> 00:24:01.350
when we are talking about
keyword interaction?

00:24:01.350 --> 00:24:04.160
We already talked about
native components,

00:24:04.161 --> 00:24:09.520
which are usually really good
and beneficial for screen readers.

00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:13.110
But in this case,
it's also necessary to understand

00:24:13.110 --> 00:24:20.720
that every native component from HTML
has their own keyboard interaction.

00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:23.340
It's not the same way you
navigate using a radio group

00:24:23.340 --> 00:24:25.750
or you navigate a checkbox.

00:24:25.750 --> 00:24:29.300
So you can access the
checkbox using the tab key,

00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:33.780
but you need to enable the
checkbox by pressing the space bar.

00:24:33.780 --> 00:24:37.190
In the case of radio groups,
you can access the radio group

00:24:37.190 --> 00:24:39.580
using the tab key,
and you need to navigate

00:24:39.580 --> 00:24:43.260
between the radio groups
using up and down arrows.

00:24:43.260 --> 00:24:48.190
Those are patterns that are also
necessary to keep into consideration

00:24:48.190 --> 00:24:51.080
when you are selecting
those components.

00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:52.350
Why is this important?

00:24:52.350 --> 00:24:56.140
Because it will be meaningful
or not for people that are blind

00:24:56.140 --> 00:25:01.870
or depends on a screen reader, or
also depends on keyboard navigation.

00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:05.445
On the other side,
when we are navigating

00:25:05.446 --> 00:25:07.400
or creating complex components,

00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:12.330
because yes or yes, we need to
customize our visualizations,

00:25:12.330 --> 00:25:17.370
our controls, it will be necessary
to understand that consistency

00:25:17.370 --> 00:25:18.670
is the key.

00:25:18.670 --> 00:25:22.970
So if we are just replicating
the use of one component

00:25:22.970 --> 00:25:27.850
or complex component in another
visualization, we need to understand

00:25:27.850 --> 00:25:31.350
what will be the
purpose of this control.

00:25:31.350 --> 00:25:36.950
So try to create a control with
the same consistent navigation

00:25:36.950 --> 00:25:41.620
that will be replicable
to all other sections.

00:25:41.620 --> 00:25:44.330
Three important points
with the complex components

00:25:44.330 --> 00:25:48.500
when you are creating visualizations,
a structural navigation.

00:25:48.500 --> 00:25:52.170
What will be the specific
structure of your visualization?

00:25:52.170 --> 00:25:55.537
It means the logical,
meaningful navigation

00:25:55.538 --> 00:25:59.700
when the user is navigating
with the tab key, for example.

00:25:59.700 --> 00:26:01.580
Then we have the
spatial navigation.

00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:07.160
What will be the logical way
to access that visualization?

00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:11.930
It will be top, then down,
then up, then down again.

00:26:11.930 --> 00:26:14.910
What will be the specific
interactions that you are looking for

00:26:14.910 --> 00:26:16.710
with this visualization?

00:26:16.710 --> 00:26:18.960
Finally, targeted visualization.

00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:26.960
So how can we create spaces for
the user to be fully concentrated

00:26:27.430 --> 00:26:29.620
in our visualization?

00:26:29.620 --> 00:26:31.530
So [Inaudible 00:26:30]

00:26:31.530 --> 00:26:36.990
we are expecting from our user
in terms of navigation with

00:26:36.990 --> 00:26:39.280
or in regards with
this visualization.

00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:41.240
That’s why it's really important.

00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:46.960
It’s not the same to navigate
through a scatter plot

00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:49.130
and through an Instagram.

00:26:49.130 --> 00:26:50.850
It's not the same, right?

00:26:50.850 --> 00:26:55.260
But if we are using a similar
complex components that I can use

00:26:55.260 --> 00:26:58.030
to filter the information
in a scatter plot,

00:26:58.030 --> 00:27:00.630
but I can use the same
component in the Instagram,

00:27:00.630 --> 00:27:04.260
the consistency will
be the key here, OK?

00:27:04.260 --> 00:27:05.260
Perfect.

00:27:05.850 --> 00:27:09.780
So set of best practices
that can help you.

00:27:09.780 --> 00:27:12.670
ARIA Authoring Practices Guide.

00:27:12.670 --> 00:27:20.590
In this page, you will find the
most-accepted interaction patterns

00:27:20.590 --> 00:27:24.685
for the screen readers,
keyboard navigation patterns

00:27:24.686 --> 00:27:31.040
for keyboard users, for the
HTML5 components from websites.

00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:37.610
So you can find the most important
references [Inaudible 00:27:25],

00:27:37.610 --> 00:27:42.820
which is the organization in charge
to create the way accessibility area

00:27:42.820 --> 00:27:43.820
best practices.

00:27:44.930 --> 00:27:50.850
So in this guide, you will find
multiple best practices you can use

00:27:50.850 --> 00:27:57.360
and incorporate in your code, or you
can replicate in multiple CMS, OK?

00:27:57.360 --> 00:27:58.590
Perfect.

00:27:58.590 --> 00:28:03.780
The next point is that you
need to define a control system

00:28:03.780 --> 00:28:05.500
or an accessibility matrix.

00:28:05.500 --> 00:28:12.580
Do you remember that I talked
about this team that was able

00:28:12.580 --> 00:28:15.530
to create all the colors available?

00:28:15.530 --> 00:28:17.350
So you can use all of
them, whatever you want.

00:28:17.350 --> 00:28:21.060
You can customize with the
colors that you want, OK?

00:28:21.060 --> 00:28:25.730
But sometimes it's really difficult
to determine if a combination

00:28:25.730 --> 00:28:30.930
of a specific set of colors will
create [Inaudible 00:28:28].

00:28:30.930 --> 00:28:35.950
Yes, we can provide this type
of freedom to our customers

00:28:35.950 --> 00:28:40.490
that will be really great,
but it's always our responsibility

00:28:40.490 --> 00:28:45.670
to create best practices also
that we can share to our users

00:28:45.670 --> 00:28:49.440
to create spaces that will
be accessible for them.

00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:50.900
How can we do that?

00:28:50.900 --> 00:28:55.350
So we have our color palette
and we can just match

00:28:55.350 --> 00:29:00.810
what will be the contrast that will
match best with the combinations.

00:29:00.810 --> 00:29:04.960
And you can create a specific
guideline that says, OK,

00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:09.870
so those colors are matching
the minimum requirements

00:29:09.870 --> 00:29:13.780
in terms of colors,
contrast, background,

00:29:13.780 --> 00:29:17.320
foreground regarding the Web
Content Accessibility guidelines,

00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:18.400
for example.

00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:22.880
So you can create a specific scenario
that you can share with them,

00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:25.780
and they can manipulate
information in a way

00:29:25.780 --> 00:29:29.649
that can create
customized environments

00:29:29.650 --> 00:29:32.550
that are also accessible, OK?

00:29:32.550 --> 00:29:35.950
Another important point
that I would like to mention

00:29:35.950 --> 00:29:39.130
is the pattern library.

00:29:39.130 --> 00:29:44.710
So what happens if I tell you
that color blindness is one

00:29:44.710 --> 00:29:49.590
of the most common disability
that we can find right now

00:29:49.590 --> 00:29:52.140
when we are talking
about visualizations?

00:29:52.140 --> 00:29:55.060
And I'm telling you this
because I was working

00:29:55.060 --> 00:30:02.170
with a specific area full of men,
and most of them, incredibly,

00:30:02.170 --> 00:30:05.230
had color blindness condition,
and they didn't know

00:30:05.230 --> 00:30:10.100
until they started working with
a specific product of the system.

00:30:11.990 --> 00:30:15.030
So what will be the
recommendations?

00:30:15.030 --> 00:30:19.070
Always try to create
a pattern library.

00:30:19.070 --> 00:30:20.560
What is the meaning of that?

00:30:20.560 --> 00:30:27.790
Try to create a specific
selection of lines, dots, icons,

00:30:29.770 --> 00:30:33.710
backgrounds, templates,
everything that can help you

00:30:33.710 --> 00:30:39.200
to create the content in a way that
can be accessible for other users,

00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:40.200
OK?

00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:47.180
I have for an example for that,
and this is a really good scenario.

00:30:47.180 --> 00:30:52.570
So we have on the screen a pie
chart that is using a specific set

00:30:52.570 --> 00:30:53.810
of colors.

00:30:53.810 --> 00:30:58.470
This is an accessible way
to present to the customer.

00:30:58.470 --> 00:31:05.250
So if you can click on the enable
color patterns, you can find

00:31:05.250 --> 00:31:11.030
what will be the specific
pattern or specific sections

00:31:11.030 --> 00:31:14.090
that were designed for
each of the colors.

00:31:14.090 --> 00:31:21.900
For example, you can definitely
identify that each color is

00:31:21.900 --> 00:31:26.260
with a specific pattern.

00:31:29.810 --> 00:31:33.500
So you can see how important it is.

00:31:33.500 --> 00:31:38.540
For people that are not able to
just distinguish multiple colors,

00:31:38.540 --> 00:31:44.310
you can enable small sections like
this and enable a background pattern

00:31:44.310 --> 00:31:48.040
so you can better
identify your content.

00:31:50.570 --> 00:31:56.230
Another point that is
really interesting here is,

00:31:56.230 --> 00:32:02.060
I had multiple conversations
with the technical writers.

00:32:02.060 --> 00:32:10.060
I'm probably using technical
writers while we are talking

00:32:12.910 --> 00:32:15.340
about technical writers.

00:32:15.340 --> 00:32:19.360
The language that we are using
to create our components,

00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:21.490
it's also important.

00:32:21.490 --> 00:32:26.330
We talk about learning disabilities,
cognitive disabilities,

00:32:26.330 --> 00:32:29.920
mental health,
and any other type of disability

00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:35.980
that can directly impact the
opportunity to make decisions.

00:32:35.980 --> 00:32:43.480
So the content needs to be simple
as much as in the technical areas

00:32:43.480 --> 00:32:44.780
that we are, right?

00:32:44.780 --> 00:32:49.670
Not in all spaces we can
just change the word probably

00:32:49.670 --> 00:32:51.990
because the profile or
the type of audience

00:32:51.990 --> 00:32:55.130
that will access that information
will not be familiar with that.

00:32:55.130 --> 00:32:58.860
So that is really important
for us to understand that.

00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:07.440
My recommendation is that, for the
designers and developers, always try

00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:11.220
to have a technical writer,
or a technical person

00:33:11.220 --> 00:33:15.540
that can help you to use the
specific words that will be easy

00:33:15.540 --> 00:33:18.750
to understand when you are
creating customized components

00:33:18.750 --> 00:33:22.700
on your visualizations, because
it will be the best way for you

00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:25.164
to create content that
will be accessible,

00:33:25.165 --> 00:33:26.940
and it will be easy to handle.

00:33:28.580 --> 00:33:34.090
For example, on the screen, I have a
screenshot of a specific dashboard.

00:33:35.460 --> 00:33:41.310
So the name or the text that
we use to create buttons

00:33:41.310 --> 00:33:46.820
or tab panels or to call
some actions, et cetera

00:33:46.820 --> 00:33:49.830
in this particular
[Inaudible 00:33:48]

00:33:49.830 --> 00:33:50.530
really important.

00:33:50.530 --> 00:33:52.730
The simpler, the better.

00:33:52.730 --> 00:33:58.380
So my recommendation is always
keep in mind the language.

00:33:58.380 --> 00:34:02.140
Always try to contact
your technical writer.

00:34:02.140 --> 00:34:07.400
Always try to create
some design critiques.

00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:09.420
This is something
that is also important

00:34:09.420 --> 00:34:12.940
so you can design a specific view.

00:34:12.940 --> 00:34:15.200
Just have a conversation
with the developers.

00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:18.066
Have a conversation with
the designers and say,

00:34:18.067 --> 00:34:19.380
What is missing here?

00:34:19.380 --> 00:34:22.940
So how can we improve this?
Do you remember the question

00:34:22.940 --> 00:34:26.010
that I talked about at the
beginning of the presentation?

00:34:26.010 --> 00:34:29.810
It's, like, How can we create
this accessible? Even the text,

00:34:29.810 --> 00:34:31.260
it's important, OK?

00:34:32.270 --> 00:34:36.390
So one of the last topics
that I would like to share,

00:34:36.390 --> 00:34:38.540
because we only have
40 minutes [chuckles]

00:34:38.540 --> 00:34:43.850
and a couple of more minutes,
is the accessibility user personas.

00:34:43.850 --> 00:34:46.920
So it's always necessary.

00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:52.240
When we are creating visualizations,
we usually think or create personas

00:34:52.240 --> 00:34:57.560
with profiles that are extremely
high technical profiles,

00:34:57.560 --> 00:35:02.930
and we don't think about the
basic needs on accessibility,

00:35:02.930 --> 00:35:08.010
which is why it's necessary for
you to consider multiple scenarios.

00:35:08.010 --> 00:35:11.650
Usually, we have the frustrations,
the motivations, the type

00:35:11.650 --> 00:35:14.410
of technology they use,
but what about the type

00:35:14.410 --> 00:35:17.860
of technology they use to
access the information?

00:35:17.860 --> 00:35:21.610
For example, they are using a laptop,
they are using a desktop computer,

00:35:21.610 --> 00:35:25.540
they are using a Linux
computer, right?

00:35:25.540 --> 00:35:28.300
Because this is something
that is really, really common

00:35:28.300 --> 00:35:32.990
in data experiments; they
are using Linux as well.

00:35:32.990 --> 00:35:39.180
So are we prepared for Linux
operating systems or not?

00:35:39.180 --> 00:35:43.110
And for example, what will
be the needs for this person?

00:35:43.110 --> 00:35:45.890
So they need to work using, like,
a light [Inaudible 00:35:45]

00:35:45.890 --> 00:35:48.580
better for them to
[Inaudible 00:35:47].

00:35:48.580 --> 00:35:52.350
So are we prepared to create
our visualizations in dark mode?

00:35:52.350 --> 00:35:54.870
That would be the best
approach that we can take.

00:35:54.870 --> 00:35:58.260
So that's why it's really
necessary for us to understand.

00:35:58.260 --> 00:35:59.980
This is an example.

00:35:59.980 --> 00:36:04.760
On the screen, you have an example
of a hearing impaired user,

00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:06.910
where you can find many things.

00:36:06.910 --> 00:36:10.370
So I will go back to the previous
slide because I would like

00:36:10.370 --> 00:36:13.895
to share with you
some of the questions

00:36:13.896 --> 00:36:16.980
that would be necessary to manage.

00:36:18.210 --> 00:36:22.560
So what would be the task barrier
or what would be the goal?

00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:25.580
What would you like to
measure with the visualization

00:36:25.580 --> 00:36:29.360
when we are talking about
user accessibility personas?

00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:33.870
Sometimes we say, OK, the way that
we can understand the information.

00:36:33.870 --> 00:36:34.650
Perfect.

00:36:34.650 --> 00:36:35.750
This is check.

00:36:35.750 --> 00:36:38.833
But how can we make a
decision through the selection

00:36:38.833 --> 00:36:40.970
of the information?

00:36:40.970 --> 00:36:42.820
So that's why [Inaudible 00:36:41]

00:36:42.820 --> 00:36:46.560
the font size of the
text that I have.

00:36:46.560 --> 00:36:47.880
It will be highly enough.

00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:49.290
Can I customize the text?

00:36:50.360 --> 00:36:54.230
Zoom in the content in a
way that I can just perceive

00:36:54.230 --> 00:36:55.530
the information better.

00:36:55.530 --> 00:36:59.440
So that's why it's really important
for us to understand that.

00:37:02.660 --> 00:37:06.876
I can share the
presentation to anyone

00:37:06.877 --> 00:37:10.829
that will be [Inaudible 00:37:05].

00:37:10.830 --> 00:37:14.790
All the reference are there so you
can look up all the information.

00:37:14.790 --> 00:37:19.360
And definitely, it's something
that [Inaudible 00:37:17], OK?

00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:21.210
So don't forget to create
your user personas.

00:37:24.880 --> 00:37:26.100
User accessibility personas.

00:37:27.130 --> 00:37:35.130
OK, two more slides to
finish the conversation.

00:37:38.670 --> 00:37:42.218
Usually, when we think that
accessibility is something

00:37:42.219 --> 00:37:48.900
that is ugly or it would be difficult
to implement, that is not true, OK?

00:37:48.900 --> 00:37:51.240
It could take discussions.

00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:53.380
It could take conversations.

00:37:53.380 --> 00:37:55.010
It could take adiations.

00:37:55.010 --> 00:37:59.580
But it’s always possible to
create accessible content.

00:38:01.170 --> 00:38:04.540
Sometimes we say we
need to create something

00:38:04.540 --> 00:38:08.780
that will be completely
accessible, and it is not possible

00:38:08.780 --> 00:38:12.660
to create something 100%.

00:38:12.660 --> 00:38:15.723
So it’s necessary
for us to understand

00:38:15.724 --> 00:38:18.000
that we can create something

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:23.850
that will be equivalent,
or we can create multiple contexts

00:38:23.850 --> 00:38:28.580
that can help us to create accessible
environments in a specific page

00:38:28.580 --> 00:38:31.750
that is using multiple
components that are complex.

00:38:31.750 --> 00:38:39.180
Of course, always try to create and
identify your components in a way

00:38:39.180 --> 00:38:41.820
that will be accessible
as much as possible.

00:38:41.820 --> 00:38:48.190
For example, if you are using a
theme that is accessible already,

00:38:48.190 --> 00:38:52.230
but there are some specific
sections that are not possible

00:38:52.230 --> 00:38:56.910
to customize,
always prepare yourself, your team.

00:38:56.910 --> 00:39:04.910
Create a specific accessibility
exception document

00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:11.490
so you can add all the restrictions
that you have with the system.

00:39:11.490 --> 00:39:13.980
Because it's necessary
for you to understand

00:39:13.980 --> 00:39:19.640
that sometimes we are working with
sites that are already created,

00:39:19.640 --> 00:39:23.480
and they didn't think about
accessibility at the beginning,

00:39:23.480 --> 00:39:27.040
and now it’ll be a little bit
difficult to implement accessibility.

00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:30.310
So it will be necessary
for you to identify

00:39:30.310 --> 00:39:34.290
what will be the best strategy
to create a content for them

00:39:34.290 --> 00:39:35.320
and make it accessible.

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:42.450
Of course, try to create a
set of [Inaudible 00:39:41]

00:39:42.450 --> 00:39:48.660
to understand what accessibility
go to in terms of their industry

00:39:48.660 --> 00:39:52.160
and the type of audience that
will be [Inaudible 00:39:49].

00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:56.210
Finally, one of the things that
I would like to mention is that,

00:39:56.210 --> 00:40:00.240
always know the purpose
of the visualization.

00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:04.120
Don't just create visualization
because, yes, right?

00:40:04.120 --> 00:40:08.070
Always create visualizations
with a meaning.

00:40:08.070 --> 00:40:12.160
Always try to humanize the
visualization as much as possible.

00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:15.123
Consider the different disabilities

00:40:15.124 --> 00:40:18.510
that we talked about
at the beginning.

00:40:18.510 --> 00:40:23.050
Always consider disabilities
from the first planning session,

00:40:23.050 --> 00:40:27.130
not during the coding session
or during the testing session

00:40:27.130 --> 00:40:29.590
or even after the first launch.

00:40:29.590 --> 00:40:30.750
No, no, no, no.

00:40:30.750 --> 00:40:34.630
It's necessary for you to understand
that disability needs to be part

00:40:34.630 --> 00:40:36.680
of the conversation always.

00:40:36.680 --> 00:40:40.090
Of course, always try to
understand what will be, like,

00:40:40.090 --> 00:40:43.840
the governance model
of your organization.

00:40:43.840 --> 00:40:45.280
What is the meaning of that?

00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:50.190
If you are in the United States, what
are the specific accessibility laws

00:40:50.190 --> 00:40:50.950
that you need to follow?

00:40:50.950 --> 00:40:54.000
If you are in Europe,
what are the [Inaudible 00:40:53]

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:58.080
standards, normatives that you
need to follow in your country?

00:40:58.080 --> 00:41:01.920
So it will be better when you
are informed about the laws,

00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:05.630
restrictions that can
affect your business.

00:41:05.630 --> 00:41:08.550
That’s all for me.

00:41:08.550 --> 00:41:11.780
I guess I just
concluded right on time.

00:41:11.780 --> 00:41:15.280
Thank you so much for
joining this conversation,

00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:17.840
and I guess we have time
for a few questions.

00:41:19.367 --> 00:41:20.150
 BEN: Awesome.

00:41:20.150 --> 00:41:21.680
Merary, that was amazing.

00:41:21.680 --> 00:41:23.420
Thank you so much.

00:41:23.420 --> 00:41:27.190
I have, like, a bunch of projects
that we're currently working on

00:41:27.190 --> 00:41:29.950
in mind that I need to go
apply a bunch of stuff to.

00:41:29.950 --> 00:41:32.650
I really appreciate it.

00:41:32.650 --> 00:41:35.070
We had some great
questions come in.

00:41:35.070 --> 00:41:38.120
So we'll get to as many of them
as we can in the next few minutes.

00:41:40.180 --> 00:41:47.050
We had a question come in
about, Can you share a link

00:41:47.050 --> 00:41:51.250
to the presentation so folks
can go back and review it later?

00:41:51.250 --> 00:41:52.650
I think you said yes to that?

00:41:53.433 --> 00:41:54.120
 <v Merary> Yes.

00:41:54.120 --> 00:41:55.040
 BEN: OK, great.

00:41:55.040 --> 00:42:02.200
And I know that if you folks
can check back on the page

00:42:02.200 --> 00:42:07.420
for this session... And presentations
will be uploaded if they're shared

00:42:07.420 --> 00:42:09.960
with the WordPress Accessibility
Day team, I believe.

00:42:11.307 --> 00:42:11.860
 <v Merary> OK.

00:42:15.020 --> 00:42:18.090
 BEN: Question from Hilda: Can
you recommend any accessible chart

00:42:18.090 --> 00:42:21.360
and graph libraries that can be
included in WordPress plugins?

00:42:21.360 --> 00:42:24.340
We want to add charts in
the admin of our plugin,

00:42:24.340 --> 00:42:26.150
but some of the most
recommended libraries

00:42:26.151 --> 00:42:27.370
are prohibitively expensive.

00:42:27.370 --> 00:42:29.390
They want to charge per
installation, which doesn't work

00:42:29.390 --> 00:42:30.440
for free plugins.

00:42:31.467 --> 00:42:34.910
 <v Merary> Well, well, well,
this is a good question.

00:42:34.910 --> 00:42:36.820
This is a good
question, because most

00:42:36.820 --> 00:42:38.530
of the libraries are
really expensive.

00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:43.670
Well,
I have experienced in two ways.

00:42:45.450 --> 00:42:50.810
Teams that are fully customizing
from scratch, all the visualizations,

00:42:51.990 --> 00:42:54.630
some of them are using libraries.

00:42:54.630 --> 00:42:56.860
So I have a couple of references.

00:42:56.860 --> 00:42:57.860
[Inaudible 00:42:57]

00:42:58.960 --> 00:43:01.410
charts from Google are really nice.

00:43:01.410 --> 00:43:05.920
And also, there are some libraries
from GitHub that you can use.

00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:10.160
And a couple of references
that you can have in terms of

00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:14.950
how to create visualizations when
you are, like, not in a budget.

00:43:14.950 --> 00:43:15.600
[chuckles]

00:43:15.600 --> 00:43:20.050
So it’s definitely something that
I can share with you at the end

00:43:20.050 --> 00:43:21.100
of the presentation.

00:43:22.533 --> 00:43:23.200
 BEN: Awesome.

00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:23.530
Thank you.

00:43:23.530 --> 00:43:27.220
I think a lot of people
will appreciate that.

00:43:27.220 --> 00:43:29.500
Someone asked: Is there
a good resource for all

00:43:29.500 --> 00:43:31.650
of the different browsers
and screen readers?

00:43:33.940 --> 00:43:34.950
 <v Merary> Resource?

00:43:34.950 --> 00:43:39.690
 BEN: I guess a testing
matrix or something like that is

00:43:39.690 --> 00:43:40.440
how I'm interpreting that.

00:43:41.700 --> 00:43:48.300
 <v Merary> Well, actually
that is not recommended to try

00:43:48.300 --> 00:43:55.790
to measure how much people are
using screen readers on your site.

00:43:55.790 --> 00:43:57.110
It's against the law.

00:43:58.400 --> 00:44:02.260
But in the case of recommendations
that I guess is your point is,

00:44:02.260 --> 00:44:08.460
there are a few good resources.

00:44:08.460 --> 00:44:13.280
Like, Deque.com, they have some
open libraries, open resources

00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:17.480
that you can have all
the most recent, how-to.

00:44:17.480 --> 00:44:20.350
Step by step, and how to
use multiple screen readers.

00:44:20.350 --> 00:44:25.950
In fact, in the folder that I shared
with you, with the information,

00:44:25.950 --> 00:44:28.960
you will find, like,
any specific documentation including

00:44:28.960 --> 00:44:32.250
the most common screen
reader shortcuts.

00:44:32.250 --> 00:44:35.480
So you can have that information
available for you to start.

00:44:35.480 --> 00:44:38.610
I also shared with you at checklists,
including the best practices

00:44:38.610 --> 00:44:43.640
to just create, like, the first
visualization the best way possible.

00:44:43.640 --> 00:44:46.660
Also, there is something that I
can prepare and create for you.

00:44:46.660 --> 00:44:51.170
So I can just share that with
the leaders of the conversation

00:44:51.170 --> 00:44:54.640
and they can share that
to the general population.

00:44:54.640 --> 00:44:56.270
 BEN: Amazing.

00:44:56.270 --> 00:44:57.270
Thank you.

00:44:57.800 --> 00:45:02.030
Question from Giovanni: In your
opinion, how much is the lack

00:45:02.030 --> 00:45:06.200
of culture around accessibility
in both design and programming

00:45:06.200 --> 00:45:08.340
due to the fact that
in many countries,

00:45:08.340 --> 00:45:11.560
there are no traditional
study courses on those topics?

00:45:13.870 --> 00:45:15.580
 <v Merary> Oh, my God.

00:45:15.580 --> 00:45:18.560
This is sweet.

00:45:18.560 --> 00:45:19.250
OK.

00:45:19.250 --> 00:45:20.390
[chuckles]

00:45:20.390 --> 00:45:22.010
Why is this important?

00:45:22.010 --> 00:45:24.780
In the case of
accessibility, definitely,

00:45:26.070 --> 00:45:27.940
there are not many professionals.

00:45:29.590 --> 00:45:34.200
If you are interested in
learning about accessibility,

00:45:34.200 --> 00:45:38.440
it's something that sometimes
you need to do by yourself.

00:45:38.440 --> 00:45:45.490
You need to, like, just become a
specific expert, googling information

00:45:45.490 --> 00:45:49.950
in regards to accessibility,
taking all the trainings available

00:45:49.950 --> 00:45:51.360
for multiple companies.

00:45:51.360 --> 00:45:55.290
And all the companies,
they have multiple points of view

00:45:55.290 --> 00:45:57.630
in terms of accessibility.

00:45:57.630 --> 00:46:04.000
I guess my best recommendation
is, read about the best practices

00:46:05.700 --> 00:46:07.360
as per your country.

00:46:07.360 --> 00:46:14.380
So read about the Web Content
Accessibility Guidelines,

00:46:14.380 --> 00:46:17.330
try to understand what are
the purposes, try to read

00:46:17.330 --> 00:46:21.010
what are the norms that are
specifically applied to your country

00:46:21.010 --> 00:46:23.910
so you will understand what
the most common disabilities

00:46:23.910 --> 00:46:27.230
in your country are, then you
will be familiar with the content

00:46:27.230 --> 00:46:28.740
that you are creating.

00:46:28.740 --> 00:46:31.710
There are other types
of institutions.

00:46:31.710 --> 00:46:38.310
For example, DequeUniversity.com,
it's a good resource to start.

00:46:38.310 --> 00:46:44.810
And also Level Access, the open
courses, and Microsoft are a good set

00:46:44.810 --> 00:46:48.060
of accessibility training
sessions you can take.

00:46:48.060 --> 00:46:49.310
You can start from that.

00:46:51.167 --> 00:46:51.780
 BEN: Yes.

00:46:51.780 --> 00:46:58.730
And I know there's a number of
efforts to get more universities

00:46:58.730 --> 00:47:03.400
and more kind of even primary
schools starting to work

00:47:03.400 --> 00:47:06.760
on adding accessibility into their
curriculum, but it's a journey

00:47:06.760 --> 00:47:07.760
to get there.

00:47:08.790 --> 00:47:09.750
Great question, Giovanni.

00:47:09.750 --> 00:47:10.750
Thanks.

00:47:13.100 --> 00:47:18.640
Question from Federico: Is it
OK to make a disabled persona?

00:47:18.640 --> 00:47:21.820
How does that work with all
the disabilities to consider?

00:47:23.110 --> 00:47:27.390
How many disabled personas
is a persona really adequate

00:47:27.390 --> 00:47:28.720
for that use case?

00:47:30.302 --> 00:47:31.372
 <v Merary> Hmm.

00:47:31.373 --> 00:47:32.350
OK.

00:47:32.667 --> 00:47:38.350
Well, one of the things that I
will usually try to recommend is,

00:47:38.350 --> 00:47:43.760
think about the type of industry
that you are working with.

00:47:44.850 --> 00:47:49.880
For example, if you are working
for a company where, usually,

00:47:49.880 --> 00:47:56.900
the data or the visualization
that you are creating implies

00:47:56.900 --> 00:48:00.374
that the audience be
highly technically skilled,

00:48:00.375 --> 00:48:04.137
you need to think about
types of disability

00:48:04.138 --> 00:48:07.130
that are not necessarily physical,

00:48:08.190 --> 00:48:14.270
like learning disabilities or
cognitive disabilities, right?

00:48:14.270 --> 00:48:15.840
So this is really important.

00:48:15.840 --> 00:48:18.150
Mental health is really important.

00:48:18.150 --> 00:48:22.510
So always think about what
will be the major impact

00:48:22.510 --> 00:48:28.250
through your audience; and based
on that, you can create a mix

00:48:28.250 --> 00:48:31.540
of disabilities that can
help you to understand.

00:48:31.540 --> 00:48:34.230
It will be impossible
to cover all of them,

00:48:34.230 --> 00:48:42.230
but you can think about vision,
hearing, mobility, speech,

00:48:44.140 --> 00:48:50.220
and cognitive disabilities.

00:48:50.220 --> 00:48:54.010
Those type of disabilities
will be the most recommended

00:48:54.010 --> 00:48:56.400
to think about when you
are creating content.

00:48:59.400 --> 00:48:59.800
 BEN: Great.

00:49:00.930 --> 00:49:01.090
OK.

00:49:01.090 --> 00:49:05.680
I think we've got time for one last
question, and then we'll wrap up.

00:49:07.210 --> 00:49:10.240
During COVID, we had maps and charts
for tracking and sharing data.

00:49:10.240 --> 00:49:13.520
Our approach was to hide
the maps from keyboard users

00:49:13.520 --> 00:49:15.690
and allow for an
alternative approach.

00:49:15.690 --> 00:49:17.730
This tested really
well with our users.

00:49:17.730 --> 00:49:21.830
One alternative we used
was a table which worked,

00:49:21.830 --> 00:49:24.640
but some folks expressed
frustration with the tables,

00:49:24.640 --> 00:49:27.330
although they expected
and could use the tables.

00:49:27.330 --> 00:49:30.730
Another alternative was to have
smaller charts with hidden text

00:49:30.730 --> 00:49:31.650
to speak the data.

00:49:31.650 --> 00:49:33.220
This tested extremely well.

00:49:33.220 --> 00:49:35.860
Do you have any other good
alternative approaches

00:49:35.860 --> 00:49:38.950
to provide the data outside of
a giant map or chart or table?

00:49:40.240 --> 00:49:42.010
 <v Merary> Yes, indeed.

00:49:42.010 --> 00:49:48.030
Actually, you can create options
for the users to download the image.

00:49:48.030 --> 00:49:51.550
Sometimes it would not be
necessary to use a table

00:49:51.550 --> 00:49:56.750
or other small description
from the graphic, but they want

00:49:56.750 --> 00:50:01.030
to just take a snapshot
or download the image

00:50:01.030 --> 00:50:04.420
so they can just download the
information to their phones,

00:50:04.420 --> 00:50:08.630
and just use the zoom
option, the pinch zoom,

00:50:08.630 --> 00:50:12.110
to read the information
in their own way.

00:50:12.110 --> 00:50:17.150
So it will be an option also,
but the table is always the best way

00:50:17.150 --> 00:50:18.390
to do it.

00:50:18.390 --> 00:50:21.660
But [Inaudible 00:50:19]

00:50:21.660 --> 00:50:28.510
if you can add, like, filter
controls through your visualization

00:50:28.510 --> 00:50:32.070
and you can select the specific
options that you want to select

00:50:32.070 --> 00:50:35.150
to read to understand,
that would be also a good idea.

00:50:35.150 --> 00:50:37.870
And just to download the
portion of information,

00:50:37.870 --> 00:50:39.110
that way is also a good idea.

00:50:41.133 --> 00:50:41.610
 BEN: Awesome.

00:50:41.610 --> 00:50:42.390
Thanks.

00:50:42.390 --> 00:50:44.500
All right,
that does it for our time.

00:50:44.500 --> 00:50:46.550
Merary, thank you so much.
