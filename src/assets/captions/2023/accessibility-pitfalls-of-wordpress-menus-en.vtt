<v Amber Hinds> WordPress
Accessibility Day 2023.

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.670
Accessibility pitfalls of
WordPress menus with speaker,

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:14.610
Deneb Pulsipher, Captain
Accessible, SeaMonster Studios.

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.780
This presentation was
recorded September 28th, 2023.

00:00:22.334 --> 00:00:26.200
<v Joost de Valk> So,
as it's exactly 10 UTC, we are going

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.790
to start right on time.

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:33.210
I am trying to be the pseudo
German, aka Dutch person that I am.

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.230
Welcome to WordPress
Accessibility Day 2023.

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.480
My name is Joost De Valk.

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.950
I'm a partner at Inglis
Capital, the CTO of Post Status

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:42.820
and many more things.

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:45.780
But more importantly,
I'm your MC for this session.

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.950
First, we have a couple
of housekeeping notes.

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.410
Please feel free to add your
questions in the Zoom Q&A section.

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:56.090
You'll find Q&A in the
bottom of your Zoom screen.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.210
Add your questions there.

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.170
We will answer them at
the end of the session.

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.440
And of course, use the chat to
connect with other attendees.

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.490
That being said, I'm very excited
to introduce our next speaker,

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.490
Deneb Pulsipher, who will talk to
us about the accessibility pitfalls

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.610
of WordPress menus.

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.060
Deneb is better known as Captain
Accessible, among his colleagues

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.530
at SeaMonster Studios,
a small development shop based

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.370
in Seattle, Washington.

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:28.170
And trusted with the critical role of
ensuring that all websites produced

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.070
by SeaMonster Studios meet
accessibility standards,

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.637
Deneb has developed
a profound interest

00:01:33.638 --> 00:01:35.690
in simple and intricate methods

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:39.380
that can enhance website
usability for all visitors.

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.130
His fascination lies in
how minor adjustments

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.390
by web developers can make a
world of difference for users,

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.500
regardless of how
they access the site.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.130
So please join me in giving
a warm welcome to Denev.

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.550
Take it away.

00:01:53.625 --> 00:01:54.290
<v Deneb Pulsipher> Thank you.

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:02.260
OK, so here in my first
slide, I'll just note

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.970
that I do have a QR code
that links to the slide deck.

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:09.630
So if you are interested in getting
that in the easiest way possible,

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.080
you can scan this code.

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:18.070
All right, so let's talk about
why it's so essential to make sure

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:22.080
that your menu,
your navigation menu is accessible.

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:27.370
So on this slide,
I have a picture of a person sitting

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:35.110
in a rowboat looking tranquilly over
this peaceful scene of this lake

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:36.740
that he is floating on.

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:41.040
There is however one thing
notably missing from this picture

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.290
and that is any oars.

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:51.040
So this person has no way of
actually moving around this locale.

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:59.600
So it’s going to be problematic
for the person coming in.

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:07.600
If we say that your site is akin
to this scene, your menu is going

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:12.970
to be those paddles, it's going to
be the way that your visitors have

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:18.640
of moving around your site
in the way that they need to.

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.450
And so without a paddle,
you are in trouble.

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.540
Getting around is hard without a
good navigation menu that works

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.130
for everybody.

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:34.260
So often, people put a lot of
thought and effort into making sure

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.600
that their navigation
menu works pretty well,

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:42.970
and that it does the things
that they want it to.

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:47.820
But if it's not accessible,
then a whole segment

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:50.060
of their audience is not
able to use it in the way

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:50.990
that they are intending.

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:55.920
And so we have got to make
sure that they can do that.

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:01.640
Now, internal page links can
work if you disregard the ability

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:02.640
to use the menu.

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:05.740
So you can direct
people around your site

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:07.450
through just internal page links.

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:08.510
That's an OK thing.

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:10.650
The further navigation is
almost always accessible

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:14.490
because there are no dropdowns or
complications as far as that goes.

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:19.670
And many people are coming from
Google anyhow, so they will come

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:24.895
to the precise page that
Google thinks they want,

00:04:24.896 --> 00:04:27.090
which often is true.

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:35.090
However, in the final analysis, you
do want people to stay on your site,

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:39.010
and in the end,
it is a numbers game.

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:40.690
What do I mean by that?

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:44.600
I mean that with your
visitors on your site, you are

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:47.950
in a race against time.

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:50.090
So here's some numbers to look at.

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:52.770
54, what is that?

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:58.760
Well, 54 actually is the average
number of seconds spent on a page.

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:06.760
So less than a minute,
internet-wide, the length of time

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:13.010
that people are actually gonna
be absorbing a page worth

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:17.250
of information before they are
looking to go to their next page.

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:20.750
Next number, five to seven.

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:21.590
Well, what's that?

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:25.150
That's the average number of
pages visited per session.

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:28.610
So they will come onto your site
and they will stay on your site

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:33.840
for an average number of five to
seven distinct pages of your site.

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:39.460
Well, so you hope that you can
get them to the right place

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:41.770
within those five to seven pages.

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:48.070
Let's look at the average depth of
your best converting call to action.

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:52.300
So on one of your pages,
it's what you want them to get to.

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:56.080
How many pages do they have
to go through to get there?

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:58.180
And I don't know
the answer to that.

00:05:58.180 --> 00:05:59.940
Probably nobody knows
the answer to that.

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:03.420
It would be a very difficult
number to figure out.

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:07.640
But what is certain is it's almost
certainly not the first page

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:08.490
that they land on.

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:13.740
So you are going to want to
provide people with a good way

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:17.570
to get around your
site, hence the menu.

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:22.950
But it needs to be accessible so
that all your visitors can use it.

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:27.180
I've got my links to where
I got this information.

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:33.130
And then my next slide says
menus may save bounces.

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:37.050
One of the big benefits of having
a good menu, a well-designed menu,

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:39.540
is that it will save bounces.

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:42.080
So people won't come to your site,
not find what they are looking for,

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:45.030
and jump off to another place.

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:48.920
They will actually spend
some time on your site.

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:50.800
Why?

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:54.080
I say that your menu is
kind of like an old friend.

00:06:54.080 --> 00:07:01.200
Makes people feel
comfortable on your site.

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:03.710
Makes them feel like they
know what's going on,

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:05.420
and they can understand things.

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:11.020
But this is only if they
can use your menu well.

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:17.980
Your menu can be a springboard
into the other areas

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:25.220
where they will actually find
the things that you are hoping

00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:28.030
that they will find.

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:33.700
Your menu needs to avoid
some common problems.

00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:38.620
And I think a lot of people don't...
The menu was kind of given to them.

00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:41.760
It was part of the theme or
whatever that they're using

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:43.470
to develop the site.

00:07:43.470 --> 00:07:45.920
And they do not
think a lot about it,

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:49.380
but there are some common problems
that your menu needs to avoid.

00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:53.960
So what problems might be
lurking in your WordPress menu?

00:07:53.960 --> 00:08:00.230
On this screen, I have a
background image of a crocodile,

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:10.160
just looking out half
concealed under the water.

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:13.370
Oops, let's see.

00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:15.940
So what problems might be
lurking in your WordPress menu?

00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:17.100
OK, so problem number one.

00:08:19.450 --> 00:08:27.450
Your menu might only drop down
on hover and not focus or click.

00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:33.370
What this means is that if
you have a drop down menu...

00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:41.580
I have a couple of images here of
my favorite site for black history,

00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:45.130
which is blackpast.org,
which I've worked on.

00:08:45.130 --> 00:08:52.560
When I started working on it,
the menu dropped down on hover,

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:53.850
but not on focus.

00:08:53.850 --> 00:08:58.750
So I have this image
of their website

00:08:58.750 --> 00:09:05.870
and someone hovering over the
African American history menu item

00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:09.630
and it drops down and we see
this drop down with a lot

00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:14.880
of secondary menu items in there.

00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:22.690
And then the second image I
have is showing the same menu,

00:09:22.690 --> 00:09:27.850
but now it has the focus indicator
on that primary menu item,

00:09:27.850 --> 00:09:30.870
but nothing is dropping down.

00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:33.270
With many websites,
this is what you get.

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:39.990
You can see that you can tab
into the primary menu item,

00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:41.090
but it does not drop down.

00:09:41.090 --> 00:09:47.710
So you can't have access to all
of these secondary menu items

00:09:47.710 --> 00:09:50.530
that you've put in
there for a good reason.

00:09:50.530 --> 00:09:53.670
So a little closer look at this.

00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:57.300
Once again,
this is what it looks like on hover.

00:09:57.300 --> 00:10:01.740
So if you're hovering over this
category, all these drop downs.

00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:07.210
The second one, well,
I guess we missed the second one,

00:10:07.210 --> 00:10:08.480
it is just the same.

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:11.180
It's just a closer look.

00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:15.530
OK, the next slide here goes
through why this is a problem.

00:10:15.530 --> 00:10:17.460
Well, who defects?

00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:22.650
If you are able to tab into
the primary menu items,

00:10:22.650 --> 00:10:26.600
but not the secondary menu items,
then this affects keyboard users

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:29.640
because now all those
people who are navigating

00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:33.880
because they can not use mice,
maybe their mice are broken

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:39.740
or they have got tremors and so they
can not have the fine motor control

00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:44.290
to actually use a mouse
to get around the site.

00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:47.900
Or people who just prefer
to navigate by keyboard.

00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:50.560
There are many reasons
why people might.

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:57.170
And so there's a certain
portion of the population

00:10:57.170 --> 00:11:02.230
that will just navigate
your site by keyboard.

00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:07.590
And so having your menu only dropping
down on hover influences them

00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:10.110
or stops their ability
to use the menu.

00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:13.090
Also it could affect
switch device users.

00:11:13.090 --> 00:11:16.020
Those are users who
have a switch device

00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:19.410
where they only are using
one button to either advance

00:11:19.410 --> 00:11:24.580
or to select typically
that will move their focus,

00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:32.560
but it will not necessarily move
their cursor or their pointer.

00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:34.990
And so they would
not get the dropdown.

00:11:37.090 --> 00:11:40.890
Again, switch device users might
be people with no fine motor skills

00:11:40.890 --> 00:11:46.550
or limited people with cognitive
disabilities who it helps

00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:49.620
to just have an option of yay or
nay, yes or no.

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:54.250
Sometimes this will also
affect screen reader users.

00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:57.710
Depending upon the
screen reader setup.

00:11:58.730 --> 00:12:04.720
So if it's set up for the virtual
cursor to follow the focus,

00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:11.990
then they might be fine
with your dropdown on hover.

00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:14.350
But if it's not set up that
way, then they

00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:17.763
might also have trouble using...

00:12:17.764 --> 00:12:22.350
We had an interesting
little interruption

00:12:25.710 --> 00:12:26.770
by a screen reader.

00:12:26.770 --> 00:12:29.120
But yes,
so that could be problematic.

00:12:31.510 --> 00:12:33.170
OK, our second problem here.

00:12:35.730 --> 00:12:43.390
If the dropdown works on
focus, but there's no ability

00:12:43.390 --> 00:12:46.050
to pull the menu back up.

00:12:46.050 --> 00:12:54.050
So what happens if this is the
case, is that when you tab

00:12:55.170 --> 00:13:00.510
into the menu and it drops
down, your next tab would be

00:13:00.510 --> 00:13:04.610
to the submenu item, and you
would have to go through that,

00:13:04.610 --> 00:13:07.770
which is OK if there are
only a few submenu items.

00:13:08.830 --> 00:13:13.720
With BlackPast, I have this
program that will enumerate

00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:15.800
how many tab stops are on the page.

00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:19.580
And as you can see,
to get to the bottom of this menu,

00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:23.860
you actually have 87 tab stops.

00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:29.230
So if you want to get to the
International Advisory Board

00:13:29.230 --> 00:13:35.280
in the About Us menu,
you would have to tab 87 times

00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:39.410
to get there, which is problematic.

00:13:39.410 --> 00:13:43.070
If you have the ability
to suck that menu back up,

00:13:43.070 --> 00:13:45.370
then you do not have that problem.

00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:47.780
All right, so who this affects?

00:13:47.780 --> 00:13:50.760
Once again, keyboard
users, switch device users,

00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:52.110
sometimes screen reader users.

00:13:53.810 --> 00:13:55.390
Why is it a problem?

00:13:55.390 --> 00:14:01.400
It probably exponentially
increases the amount of time needed

00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:03.290
to tab through the menu.

00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:09.920
So as I said, in this
particular case, they would have

00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:16.170
to tab 87 times,
which is not likely to be something

00:14:16.170 --> 00:14:18.030
that anyone is going
to be willing to do.

00:14:18.030 --> 00:14:26.020
So making sure that you
can pull up the menu

00:14:26.020 --> 00:14:29.070
that you have dropped
down is pretty important.

00:14:29.070 --> 00:14:31.040
Usually that's going
to be through control.

00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:36.010
Like on this site, there was
supposed to be this little plus icon

00:14:36.010 --> 00:14:42.010
to the right of the
menu, the main menu item,

00:14:42.010 --> 00:14:44.150
but that had been disabled
at some point by the site.

00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:45.970
And so it wasn't
working on BlackPast.

00:14:48.510 --> 00:14:50.460
Now I do have a caveat here.

00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:51.600
Why this is a problem.

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:55.000
I say it probably exponentially
increases the amount of time needed

00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:01.030
to move through a menu, but it
would not increase that amount

00:15:01.030 --> 00:15:07.250
of time if you implement arrow key
navigation such that you can go down

00:15:07.250 --> 00:15:12.240
into the menu and then press
the right or the left arrow key

00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:16.400
to go to the next main menu item.

00:15:19.490 --> 00:15:23.270
You would not necessarily need
to have a distinct control

00:15:23.270 --> 00:15:25.830
to pull the menu back
up if you can do that.

00:15:25.830 --> 00:15:29.390
And we will talk about that
a little bit more later on,

00:15:29.390 --> 00:15:34.430
but problem two is problematic.

00:15:34.430 --> 00:15:42.430
Problem three,
if the items in your menu drop down

00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:48.600
do not have
aria-expanded attribute.

00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:53.860
Now, the aria-expanded
attribute is just something

00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:57.530
that helps assistive technology
users, primarily screen reader users.

00:15:57.530 --> 00:16:02.650
So when they move
their focus into the –

00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:07.170
in this case, for I'm looking
at Black Past site again -

00:16:07.170 --> 00:16:13.720
African American history main
menu item, they would hear,

00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:16.650
if it was in the collapse
state, if it was not expanded,

00:16:16.650 --> 00:16:21.420
they would hear African
American history link collapsed.

00:16:21.420 --> 00:16:25.510
And that would indicate to them,
oh, there's a sub menu here.

00:16:25.510 --> 00:16:32.720
So if I expand this menu,
the next place I go to is going

00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:33.720
to be inside the menu.

00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:37.610
Or if they come into
here and they hear

00:16:37.610 --> 00:16:39.975
African American
history link expanded,

00:16:39.976 --> 00:16:41.690
they are automatically going

00:16:41.690 --> 00:16:44.690
to think, OK,
so this is a drop down menu

00:16:44.690 --> 00:16:47.700
and I'm moving into it
with my next key press

00:16:49.070 --> 00:16:53.840
If they do not get that collapsed
or expanded notification,

00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:57.370
then they will add a new menu
item and end up thinking,

00:16:57.370 --> 00:17:00.090
Oh I'm here in African
American history.

00:17:00.090 --> 00:17:05.650
My next stop is going to
be the next main menu item.

00:17:05.650 --> 00:17:11.790
But after they get through six
or seven of these unrelated

00:17:11.790 --> 00:17:18.630
or non-high-level menu items,
they are going to start thinking

00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:26.630
or realizing that this may
not be what they think it is.

00:17:28.120 --> 00:17:31.180
But if they have that aria-expanded
attribute, it's going to work.

00:17:32.270 --> 00:17:33.160
Who else this affects?

00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:35.910
Refreshable Braille device users.

00:17:35.910 --> 00:17:39.540
So people who can not
see and can not hear.

00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:46.350
Why this is a problem once again,
they won't understand the menu

00:17:46.350 --> 00:17:47.190
and where they are in it.

00:17:47.190 --> 00:17:50.870
So they will have an erroneous
conception of what's going on

00:17:50.870 --> 00:17:55.410
and might get frustrated
after going through 20 things

00:17:55.410 --> 00:17:57.120
that they think are
primary menu items

00:17:57.120 --> 00:17:59.725
that are actually sub menu items.

00:18:03.740 --> 00:18:08.050
Or if your menu drops down on
click like this, for example.

00:18:08.050 --> 00:18:10.790
This African American history
would drop down as you click

00:18:10.790 --> 00:18:12.690
on the African
American history thing.

00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:19.710
The screen reader user may not
know what's happened at all.

00:18:19.710 --> 00:18:23.340
If you do not have an
expanded or contracted state,

00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:26.700
they would click on it
and it would drop down,

00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:28.126
but they would not
have any indication

00:18:28.127 --> 00:18:29.150
that anything has happened.

00:18:29.150 --> 00:18:32.090
They’d think maybe something
had just gone wrong and they are

00:18:32.090 --> 00:18:34.240
in no place now.

00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:35.290
So that could be problematic.

00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:42.280
All right, a kind of a sidebar,
the best practice for menus I've kind

00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:49.510
of decided or found is if you
have five to seven menu items,

00:18:49.510 --> 00:18:51.490
just put them in the main menu.

00:18:51.490 --> 00:18:54.390
Don't worry about
having dropdowns at all.

00:18:54.390 --> 00:18:59.940
And that's highly accessible
because then you don't have

00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:01.240
to worry about aria-expanded.

00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:03.870
You do not have to worry
about, does it drop down?

00:19:03.870 --> 00:19:04.870
Does it not?

00:19:05.690 --> 00:19:07.200
So that's super great.

00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:13.140
But if you have 15 to 20 or
more drop downs, you want them,

00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:16.530
or 15 or 20 or more items that
you want to fit into your menu,

00:19:16.530 --> 00:19:19.600
you definitely want drop downs.

00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:23.300
And you will need to make sure that
the aria-expanded attribute is there

00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:27.710
so that the drop down
works for people.

00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:29.900
OK.

00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:35.500
And here we go with our next
slide assessing the problems.

00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:36.500
So the next section.

00:19:38.620 --> 00:19:40.660
So how to assess.

00:19:40.660 --> 00:19:45.630
So if you are working on your
webpage or someone else's,

00:19:45.630 --> 00:19:50.670
and you want to see or
assess whether the menu

00:19:50.670 --> 00:19:57.650
that's in there is accessible,
well, use a keyboard.

00:19:57.650 --> 00:19:58.650
Start out that way.

00:19:59.490 --> 00:20:01.380
So you're going to hit tab.

00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:04.510
You're going to tab right
through the skip link

00:20:04.510 --> 00:20:07.230
that will probably pop
up first or second.

00:20:07.230 --> 00:20:10.560
Then you should be able to
tab into the actual menu.

00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:13.190
And you are just going to
start tabbing through it.

00:20:13.190 --> 00:20:17.760
If you get to a menu
item that is a drop-down,

00:20:20.020 --> 00:20:23.680
when you tab into it,
does it drop-down?

00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:26.090
If it doesn't, you got trouble.

00:20:26.090 --> 00:20:28.540
And you're going to have to
figure out how to fix that.

00:20:28.540 --> 00:20:30.460
We'll talk about how to
fix it in just a minute.

00:20:30.460 --> 00:20:33.350
You are going to see
if the menu drops down.

00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:37.730
You're going to see if there's
a way to make it pull up.

00:20:37.730 --> 00:20:40.230
Next, you want to assess
with the screen reader

00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:45.070
because you can use the
standard error navigation

00:20:45.070 --> 00:20:47.550
on the screen reader to go
forward through the menu

00:20:47.550 --> 00:20:51.890
and listen for your screen reader
to say, collapsed or expanded,

00:20:51.890 --> 00:20:56.170
which indicates to you
that it has the collapsed

00:20:56.170 --> 00:20:59.320
or the Aria expanded attribute
on it like it should.

00:21:01.890 --> 00:21:05.580
And finally,
you probably want to inspect.

00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:12.120
So use your browser inspector
to inspect an element.

00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:14.850
Let's take a closer look at this.

00:21:16.740 --> 00:21:21.620
OK, so if you were to
inspect, this is using Chrome,

00:21:21.620 --> 00:21:25.790
but Firefox and the other browsers
are usually pretty similar.

00:21:26.900 --> 00:21:31.590
So you'd put your pointer over
the item that makes it drop down.

00:21:31.590 --> 00:21:35.000
You would right click
and choose inspect,

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.390
which would open up your
element inspector here.

00:21:37.390 --> 00:21:45.390
What you are looking for to make
sure that the menu is dropping down

00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:48.910
and that the aria-expanded
attribute is there.

00:21:48.910 --> 00:21:52.240
You are looking to see
here on this element

00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:54.270
if there is this
aria-expanded equals true.

00:21:55.780 --> 00:22:00.440
As you can see here,
it was not this way initially,

00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:03.290
but I did remediate BlackPast
so that it does have

00:22:03.290 --> 00:22:05.430
the aria-expanded equals true.

00:22:05.430 --> 00:22:08.380
And as you can see a little
farther down this next one,

00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:11.590
global African American
history, that menu item,

00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:16.560
which is also a dropdown,
has the aria-expanded equals false.

00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:24.560
You want to make sure that when the
global African history menu item

00:22:24.830 --> 00:22:27.010
drops down that these two swap.

00:22:27.010 --> 00:22:30.680
So that your first one would
say aria-expanded false

00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:32.860
and the second one would
say aria-expanded true.

00:22:32.860 --> 00:22:40.520
If that's working, you're
golden, at least in this aspect.

00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:43.660
So that's good.

00:22:43.660 --> 00:22:44.660
All right.

00:22:46.750 --> 00:22:54.750
In preparing for this talk,
I looked through 15 theme sites

00:22:56.450 --> 00:22:57.850
of WordPress themes.

00:22:57.850 --> 00:23:01.520
So I looked through,
I went to the popular themes

00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:06.650
and I tried to find sites that
were built with those themes

00:23:06.650 --> 00:23:13.130
and I assessed them to see if they
had any of these three problems

00:23:13.130 --> 00:23:14.470
and here's what I found.

00:23:14.470 --> 00:23:16.800
And then I also looked
at five other big ones,

00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:19.930
Google and very
much and a few more.

00:23:19.930 --> 00:23:21.710
And here's what I found.

00:23:22.970 --> 00:23:28.550
Of these 20 websites,
the bad news is nine of 20

00:23:28.550 --> 00:23:31.480
of them did not drop down on focus.

00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:33.030
They only dropped out on hover.

00:23:34.150 --> 00:23:39.980
So once again, this is going to
be bad for keyboard navigators.

00:23:39.980 --> 00:23:41.670
I first got some
screen reader users.

00:23:43.330 --> 00:23:45.590
And that's almost half of them.

00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:52.750
So that's a huge number of
sites that did not work great.

00:23:52.750 --> 00:24:00.750
Of the ones that did drop
down on focus, seven of those,

00:24:02.340 --> 00:24:06.280
so seven of 11,
had no way to pull the menu back up.

00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:07.870
So once again,
that's going to be a problem too.

00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:15.410
And then of these 20 websites, 15 of
them had no aria-expanded attribute.

00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:24.940
So poor for screen reader users.

00:24:24.940 --> 00:24:29.790
The good news is there were four
sites that worked perfectly.

00:24:29.790 --> 00:24:36.640
Google had very limited drop downs,
but the one that they had worked.

00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:37.660
Merriam-Webster.

00:24:38.670 --> 00:24:40.430
So those were kind of
the industry sites.

00:24:40.430 --> 00:24:43.560
I don't know if they're probably
most certainly not built

00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:45.460
with WordPress, but they did work.

00:24:47.620 --> 00:24:52.060
And also the Elementor
demo site worked perfectly.

00:24:52.060 --> 00:24:53.820
It had no problems.

00:24:53.820 --> 00:24:57.620
And the Astra theme demo
site worked perfectly.

00:24:57.620 --> 00:25:00.690
So there is some hope.

00:25:02.010 --> 00:25:03.010
It can be done.

00:25:04.410 --> 00:25:08.840
They're out there,
the sites that work fine.

00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:16.840
But most sites, at least that I
looked at, did not work as desired.

00:25:19.090 --> 00:25:27.090
So what solutions can you
implement on your WordPress menu?

00:25:29.380 --> 00:25:30.250
Let's take a look at it.

00:25:30.250 --> 00:25:34.040
Well, you can do
some PHP remediation.

00:25:35.100 --> 00:25:39.750
And what you'll want to
do is you'll want to go in

00:25:39.750 --> 00:25:46.210
and modify the Navwalker class
that you'll find in the PHP.

00:25:47.540 --> 00:25:55.540
And I have an image here of a
screenshot of this Walker_Nav_Menu

00:25:57.740 --> 00:25:59.860
in some PHP code.

00:25:59.860 --> 00:26:02.820
It's complicated, it's confusing.

00:26:03.970 --> 00:26:08.540
And so it's, though it's probably the
best solution because it's getting

00:26:08.540 --> 00:26:12.640
at the real heart of the
issue, it's also probably

00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:18.310
beyond what the average WordPress
developer is capable of.

00:26:18.310 --> 00:26:21.570
And it's definitely beyond the
scope of this presentation.

00:26:23.090 --> 00:26:28.670
So if you want to do
it, I have a link here.

00:26:28.670 --> 00:26:34.110
You're welcome to follow to
the WordPress docs that talk

00:26:34.110 --> 00:26:35.700
about this Walker_Nav_Menu.

00:26:38.260 --> 00:26:41.860
There are ways that you
can completely swap it out.

00:26:41.860 --> 00:26:49.400
I have not found code that you
could swap in for it or instructions

00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:53.930
on how to do it to make sure
that you are changing your menu

00:26:53.930 --> 00:26:56.366
to actually be one
that is accessible,

00:26:56.367 --> 00:26:59.240
but presumably there is a way
to do that.

00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:03.410
But let's look at
some other solutions

00:27:03.410 --> 00:27:07.930
that are probably more
likely helpful for you.

00:27:08.990 --> 00:27:14.650
So the solution for
drop-down only on hover.

00:27:14.650 --> 00:27:19.120
So if it only drops down when you
hover, usually you can fix this

00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:20.860
with just some CSS remediation.

00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:25.480
So adding something
to the stylesheet.

00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:29.310
So you're going to make sure that
the menu drops down on focus.

00:27:33.780 --> 00:27:41.780
So you'll inspect an element and
then you are going to look here

00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:44.750
in the style in this first
element state, you are going

00:27:44.750 --> 00:27:47.690
to click the hover and you are
going to figure out which one

00:27:47.690 --> 00:27:55.300
of these items is actually causing
the on-hover for it to drop down.

00:27:55.300 --> 00:27:58.180
And so by clicking
and unclicking hover

00:27:58.180 --> 00:28:01.470
with different items selected
here in the inspector,

00:28:03.650 --> 00:28:07.160
you will figure out which one of
those is triggering the drop-down.

00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:12.690
Then you can scroll down in
the rules here to figure out

00:28:12.690 --> 00:28:16.540
what's changing, figure out where in
the style sheet it is changing it.

00:28:16.540 --> 00:28:20.670
And then if you just add a
hover declaration to that,

00:28:20.670 --> 00:28:28.010
add a focus declaration to the hover
declaration that's already there.

00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:33.740
So let me see if I
got all my things.

00:28:33.740 --> 00:28:36.960
Use the browser dev tools,
add a focus declaration to it,

00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:39.430
and you should get it.

00:28:39.430 --> 00:28:40.910
OK, next.

00:28:42.010 --> 00:28:48.860
For the missing aria-expanded,
you are going to need

00:28:48.860 --> 00:28:51.410
to do some JavaScript remediation.

00:28:51.410 --> 00:28:56.590
So use JavaScript to modify
the proper aria-attributes,

00:28:56.590 --> 00:28:59.740
which does add some weight
to your site's load time.

00:28:59.740 --> 00:29:03.860
So anytime you add JavaScript,
that's one more resource,

00:29:03.860 --> 00:29:06.100
and it will take a
little bit longer.

00:29:06.100 --> 00:29:14.100
So that's a consideration, but if
it's adding this essential ability,

00:29:14.340 --> 00:29:17.660
it's definitely worth it.

00:29:17.660 --> 00:29:20.730
This only works if visitors have
JavaScript enabled in their browsers.

00:29:20.730 --> 00:29:24.620
And 1.2% of Internet users do
not have JavaScript enabled,

00:29:24.620 --> 00:29:29.470
which is actually a huge number
of visitors, 62 million a year,

00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:34.240
that do not have
JavaScript enabled.

00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:41.230
So it's just something you're going
to have to deal with or accept,

00:29:41.230 --> 00:29:45.570
that it's not going to work
for everyone, unfortunately.

00:29:45.570 --> 00:29:50.900
But how do you do it if you're
missing this aria-expanded attribute?

00:29:50.900 --> 00:29:53.480
Well,
you got to select the element.

00:29:53.480 --> 00:29:57.330
And I have on the right
side of the screen, an image

00:29:57.330 --> 00:30:04.630
of the BlackPast site with
the JavaScript console open.

00:30:04.630 --> 00:30:10.160
You can see some of the
things that I wrote here.

00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:13.780
You can try at first in
the JavaScript console.

00:30:16.270 --> 00:30:20.260
And then if it works there,
then you can add it to a resource,

00:30:20.260 --> 00:30:22.310
[Inaudible 30:27]

00:30:22.310 --> 00:30:25.540
JavaScript file that is
called throughout the site.

00:30:25.540 --> 00:30:33.010
But you got to select the element
and then use the set attribute method

00:30:33.010 --> 00:30:38.860
to set the aria-expanded to
false before it is dropping down

00:30:38.860 --> 00:30:42.100
and true when it does drop down.

00:30:42.100 --> 00:30:44.620
You are going to test,
test and test, in the console,

00:30:45.710 --> 00:30:48.330
in a dev environment,
in the live environment.

00:30:48.330 --> 00:30:51.850
Make sure that this works
the way that you expect it to

00:30:51.850 --> 00:30:53.570
or that you want it to.

00:30:53.570 --> 00:31:00.290
All right, so a little closer
look at what this looks like.

00:31:00.290 --> 00:31:05.990
So you can see the code that I used
here or that I tested in the console.

00:31:09.580 --> 00:31:12.770
But in addition to setting the
initial aria-expanded attribute

00:31:12.770 --> 00:31:16.610
of aria-expanded equals
false, you will also need

00:31:16.610 --> 00:31:22.340
to add an event listener on focus
that sets the aria-expanded attribute

00:31:22.340 --> 00:31:25.630
to true and another
one on the blur.

00:31:25.630 --> 00:31:29.390
So another event listener on
blur that sets it back to false.

00:31:29.390 --> 00:31:37.390
So making sure that the aria-expanded
attribute is modified dynamically

00:31:40.430 --> 00:31:43.830
on the fly as the
states of this change.

00:31:46.060 --> 00:31:52.580
You can do something like this,
drop down items, i.addEventListener

00:31:53.970 --> 00:31:59.040
on focus, and then use
your function that adds

00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:02.510
or takes away the proper attribute.

00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:08.570
So this is scratching the
surface, not going deeply into

00:32:08.570 --> 00:32:13.830
how to do the JavaScript, but
probably you already know that bit.

00:32:13.830 --> 00:32:17.610
All right, let's talk about this
enhancement that I mentioned earlier

00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:24.440
of the arrow key navigation.

00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:34.430
If you have menus that drop down...
I have got an image

00:32:34.430 --> 00:32:42.430
of the BlackPass site once again
because it has implemented this.

00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:49.710
You'll see that it's an image
of somebody in one of the menus,

00:32:49.710 --> 00:32:52.380
but there's a little message
up above the menu that says,

00:32:52.380 --> 00:32:54.230
use the arrow keys
to navigate the menu.

00:32:54.230 --> 00:32:57.000
To enter the page, use the right
arrow key from the last menu item,

00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:59.020
or press escape at any time.

00:32:59.020 --> 00:33:02.840
So what arrow key navigation
does is it allows visitors

00:33:02.840 --> 00:33:05.750
who tab into the menu to
move their focus around it

00:33:05.750 --> 00:33:10.190
with the arrow keys, which kind of
makes it so that you do not have

00:33:10.190 --> 00:33:18.090
to worry about having a way to
suck the menu back up necessarily,

00:33:18.090 --> 00:33:22.680
because you can always just go to
the right, go to the next menu over.

00:33:25.020 --> 00:33:26.250
How to do it?

00:33:26.250 --> 00:33:28.167
It's not a simple process,

00:33:28.168 --> 00:33:31.780
but basically you add
key press event listeners

00:33:31.780 --> 00:33:35.410
while the menu item has
focus, and you push the focus,

00:33:35.410 --> 00:33:41.830
depending upon the key presses of
the right and the left arrow key,

00:33:41.830 --> 00:33:43.840
you push the focus to
the desired element.

00:33:46.250 --> 00:33:51.370
So it does require JavaScript, with
all the caveats that that requires.

00:33:51.370 --> 00:33:55.130
It is, however,
helpful for keyboard navigators.

00:33:56.150 --> 00:34:02.940
It's not necessarily super
helpful for all other users,

00:34:02.940 --> 00:34:04.450
like screen reader users.

00:34:04.450 --> 00:34:10.320
There's a way to make it work,
but it's a little bit convoluted,

00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:12.800
and so it may not be helpful to
them, but it's not problematic

00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:13.940
to them either.

00:34:13.940 --> 00:34:19.200
So it does not block their
ability to at least go

00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:22.250
through all these menu
items if they want to.

00:34:22.250 --> 00:34:30.250
It just makes it easier for keyboard
navigators and not worse for others.

00:34:31.990 --> 00:34:33.000
OK.

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:38.530
So the easy way to do this, I would
say is use the Crow's Nest plugin,

00:34:38.530 --> 00:34:45.130
which is available on the
WordPress plugin directory.

00:34:45.130 --> 00:34:48.650
And also I have a QR code here.

00:34:50.130 --> 00:34:56.520
It's a plugin that enables this
arrow key navigation on the menus.

00:34:56.520 --> 00:34:57.840
There are a few caveats.

00:34:57.840 --> 00:35:05.840
This plugin only works if the drop
down on focus is already enabled.

00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:09.130
So you have got to fix that first.

00:35:09.130 --> 00:35:17.130
And then you will set this plugin
up by targeting various elements,

00:35:25.220 --> 00:35:32.330
doing the CSS styles that
would target various elements.

00:35:33.993 --> 00:35:35.063
OK.

00:35:35.190 --> 00:35:37.210
So question.

00:35:38.540 --> 00:35:42.950
Remember that person on the lake that
we looked at the very first slide?

00:35:42.950 --> 00:35:50.480
Wouldn’t you rather have this
one paddling around your lake.

00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:57.380
Notice he's ready to stay, this
guy, he's got his fishing tackle,

00:35:57.380 --> 00:36:02.040
his fishing pole,
and he's got these oars.

00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:06.370
And so he is able to paddle around
the site, he's going to stay.

00:36:08.750 --> 00:36:12.820
That's what you want to
do with your navigation.

00:36:12.820 --> 00:36:15.420
Give your visitors
the proper paddles,

00:36:15.421 --> 00:36:24.110
the way to get around your site,
and they will stay longer.

00:36:24.110 --> 00:36:29.550
So you want to make sure that
your menu drops down on focus

00:36:29.550 --> 00:36:30.550
as well as hover.

00:36:31.240 --> 00:36:35.140
Do this by adding or adjusting
your CSS to add a focus trigger

00:36:35.140 --> 00:36:38.520
to your hover styles
that make that happen.

00:36:38.520 --> 00:36:41.380
Make sure that your menu has
a mechanism to suck back up,

00:36:42.940 --> 00:36:45.220
for keyboard and
screen reader users.

00:36:45.220 --> 00:36:48.780
So when it drops down,
you want it to have a way to come up

00:36:48.780 --> 00:36:52.220
or else they will be tapping
through the entire dropdown list,

00:36:52.220 --> 00:36:55.370
which is not great
if it's extensive.

00:36:56.810 --> 00:36:59.960
Or you can add arrow key
navigation as we have talked about.

00:37:01.460 --> 00:37:05.480
Make sure that your menu has
the proper aria attributes

00:37:05.480 --> 00:37:10.450
so it can be understood by
screen readers and their users.

00:37:12.850 --> 00:37:15.720
So that's the final takeaway.

00:37:17.210 --> 00:37:20.470
If you need a little extra help
with your menu, let's connect.

00:37:20.470 --> 00:37:26.550
I’ve got my LinkedIn link
there, my email address.

00:37:26.550 --> 00:37:32.230
So if you notice that your menu
isn't working like it needs

00:37:32.230 --> 00:37:34.800
to let me know.

00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:36.510
Hit me up and we'll talk.

00:37:39.330 --> 00:37:39.590
OK.

00:37:39.590 --> 00:37:44.620
And I guess that's all I've got.

00:37:44.620 --> 00:37:45.630
<v Joost> Thank you, Deneb.

00:37:45.630 --> 00:37:48.720
That was excellent actually.

00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:51.520
If you could stop sharing your
screen and people might be able

00:37:51.520 --> 00:37:52.710
to see you a bit better.

00:37:54.150 --> 00:37:56.700
We have a ton of questions
to go through, which is good.

00:37:56.700 --> 00:38:04.240
So I am going to try and go
through them in a bit of order

00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:06.160
as you went through
your presentation.

00:38:07.270 --> 00:38:11.290
You talked about the number of
tab stops and I can totally see

00:38:11.290 --> 00:38:15.070
why 87 tab stops to get
somewhere is a bit much.

00:38:17.230 --> 00:38:21.210
What would you recommend as a
number that is still acceptable?

00:38:22.300 --> 00:38:26.680
<v Deneb> Yes, so I have thought
about this quite a bit

00:38:26.680 --> 00:38:31.500
because I made this plugin
and so I have to decide, well,

00:38:31.500 --> 00:38:35.900
is it worth it to install this
plugin on various client sites?

00:38:35.900 --> 00:38:43.900
And so I've decided that if a menu
has maybe six main drop downs,

00:38:49.550 --> 00:38:52.080
main menu items.

00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:59.700
But if they are in 15 sub menu
items, then that's probably

00:38:59.700 --> 00:39:03.270
about where I start
thinking, OK, yes, we got

00:39:03.270 --> 00:39:05.230
to enable this arrow
key navigation.

00:39:06.910 --> 00:39:09.150
But that's my personal opinion.

00:39:09.150 --> 00:39:12.630
<v Joost> Well, no,
but it's a good number to go from.

00:39:12.630 --> 00:39:18.830
I can see how you would sort
of get to that range of number.

00:39:18.830 --> 00:39:21.750
OK, for everyone listening,
if you have your own questions,

00:39:21.750 --> 00:39:23.900
please look at the bottom
of your Zoom screen.

00:39:23.900 --> 00:39:27.280
There's a Q&A button there,
you can add your own questions.

00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:30.200
That makes it a lot easier
for me to see your questions

00:39:30.200 --> 00:39:32.930
and to actually go
through them with Deneb.

00:39:32.930 --> 00:39:36.460
We've just answered the first
one, but we're not done yet.

00:39:36.460 --> 00:39:40.670
Andrea Fertia, a former colleague
of mine, very dear to me,

00:39:40.670 --> 00:39:44.450
was actually asking, what tool
did you use to count the tab stops

00:39:44.450 --> 00:39:44.910
in the menu?

00:39:44.910 --> 00:39:46.190
<v Deneb> Oh, yes.

00:39:47.260 --> 00:39:48.690
Let me see.

00:39:48.690 --> 00:39:51.710
I'll pull that up so I can
figure out what that is.

00:39:54.460 --> 00:39:54.990
What was it?

00:39:55.991 --> 00:39:56.660
<v Joost> You know what?

00:39:56.660 --> 00:39:59.840
You'll get to share
that link later on

00:39:59.840 --> 00:40:03.990
in the WordPress
Accessibility day Slack.

00:40:03.990 --> 00:40:05.880
<v Deneb> I will put it in Slack.

00:40:05.880 --> 00:40:07.860
I'll look it up and I'll
put it in Slack for sure.

00:40:07.860 --> 00:40:08.790
<v Joost> Perfect.

00:40:08.790 --> 00:40:09.790
Thank you very much.

00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:14.440
Yolan is asking,
is vanilla JavaScript a good way

00:40:14.440 --> 00:40:17.360
to alter the navigation menu
with regards to tabbing?

00:40:18.680 --> 00:40:28.400
<v Deneb> Well, like I
said, the best way is

00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:36.530
to actually change the whole menu
with PHP to do that NavWalker class.

00:40:38.810 --> 00:40:45.930
However, the technical ability
needed to do it that way, I think,

00:40:45.930 --> 00:40:51.510
is much more substantial than
changing it with JavaScript.

00:40:51.510 --> 00:40:59.150
And so although it's not
great to be dependent

00:40:59.150 --> 00:41:06.440
upon a client-side service like
JavaScript that could be disabled

00:41:06.440 --> 00:41:10.190
on people's browsers,
though that's not great,

00:41:10.190 --> 00:41:16.930
I think it's worth it,
and it's better than nothing.

00:41:16.930 --> 00:41:19.770
Particularly if in your accessibility
statement you say, you know,

00:41:19.770 --> 00:41:25.860
there are some...
In fact you could mention your menu,

00:41:25.860 --> 00:41:29.640
call it out in the
accessibility statement and say,

00:41:29.640 --> 00:41:32.950
Hey, our menu works best if
you have JavaScript enabled,

00:41:32.950 --> 00:41:36.150
or just put that generally in your
accessibility statement someplace

00:41:36.150 --> 00:41:40.080
or site works best with
then they at least know oh,

00:41:40.080 --> 00:41:43.250
if I want the best experience,
I can enable JavaScript,

00:41:43.250 --> 00:41:45.610
even though usually I do not usually
need it, maybe for this side,

00:41:45.610 --> 00:41:46.610
I'll have it.

00:41:48.100 --> 00:41:53.050
<v Joost> And your PHP remediation,
you mentioned it takes too far

00:41:53.050 --> 00:41:55.770
for this presentation,
which I understand.

00:41:55.770 --> 00:41:59.040
But do you feel that that's
something that should actually be

00:41:59.040 --> 00:42:00.040
in WordPress core?

00:42:03.580 --> 00:42:09.470
<v Deneb> As I understand it, each theme
puts in their own navigation menu

00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:18.650
with their own PHP NavWalker class.

00:42:18.650 --> 00:42:21.060
<v Joost> They should
not for the most part.

00:42:21.860 --> 00:42:25.440
<v Deneb> It would be helpful
if WordPress would put

00:42:25.440 --> 00:42:31.890
like a fully accessible
example code,

00:42:31.890 --> 00:42:38.190
or something that developers
could start with a basis.

00:42:39.620 --> 00:42:45.260
But I don't know too much
about that side of things.

00:42:45.260 --> 00:42:47.360
<v Joost> No, that's absolutely fine.

00:42:47.360 --> 00:42:51.200
I was actually talking to our
tech guy, Jonathan Vossinger,

00:42:51.200 --> 00:42:53.760
about like, hey,
shouldn't this be in core?

00:42:53.760 --> 00:42:57.790
We'll have a look after this,
like where should this live?

00:42:57.790 --> 00:43:01.410
I think there's quite a few people
listening that may have opinions

00:43:01.410 --> 00:43:06.000
on that, but maybe we can make
this a bit better for everyone

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:08.600
and a bit easier because
I'm fully with you.

00:43:08.600 --> 00:43:11.610
If people have to start writing
navigation walker classes,

00:43:11.610 --> 00:43:14.810
that's a bit too
much for most things.

00:43:17.530 --> 00:43:20.830
Another question from Karen Suika.

00:43:20.830 --> 00:43:23.750
Karen, I don't know how to
pronounce your name, Karen, sorry.

00:43:25.350 --> 00:43:28.440
Have you tested the
current standard theme 2023

00:43:28.440 --> 00:43:31.040
and do you have any
experience with that?

00:43:31.040 --> 00:43:32.150
<v Deneb> No, I have not.

00:43:32.150 --> 00:43:33.980
That was not one of
the ones that I did.

00:43:33.980 --> 00:43:39.220
In fact, if you give my presentation,
you can click on that chart

00:43:39.220 --> 00:43:42.880
and it will take you
to the spreadsheet

00:43:42.880 --> 00:43:47.620
that I used that has listed all
of the ones that I tested.

00:43:47.620 --> 00:43:49.670
But that wasn't one of them.

00:43:49.670 --> 00:43:52.550
I'd certainly be interested in it.

00:43:52.550 --> 00:43:59.620
If you're curious, hit me up
or put that request in Slack.

00:43:59.620 --> 00:44:02.700
And I'd definitely be
interested in looking at that.

00:44:03.460 --> 00:44:06.210
<v Joost> Yes, we should definitely
also look at the new default theme

00:44:06.210 --> 00:44:12.150
being developed for WordPress to see
like, hey, is it doing this well?

00:44:12.150 --> 00:44:16.220
I think it's a good
thing to think about.

00:44:16.220 --> 00:44:19.190
Leah Roots is asking,
do you have any recommendations

00:44:19.190 --> 00:44:23.246
for accessible mega menu
designs or plugins like that?

00:44:25.800 --> 00:44:28.050
<v Deneb> I don't.

00:44:30.311 --> 00:44:40.640
So I know that, like I said, one of
the themes, I guess it was a theme.

00:44:41.060 --> 00:44:45.000
It was the Hello Elementor
theme, but with Elementor,

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:46.950
I know they've got
all sorts of things.

00:44:46.950 --> 00:44:52.200
And so I know that their default
theme did work perfectly.

00:44:53.610 --> 00:44:54.690
So their demo theme would.

00:44:54.690 --> 00:44:57.290
So that would indicate
to me that probably

00:44:57.290 --> 00:45:02.780
if they have a mega menu option
that it's probably going to work,

00:45:02.780 --> 00:45:06.950
but I have not tested it.

00:45:06.950 --> 00:45:11.340
But now, after having gone
through my presentation, you know,

00:45:11.340 --> 00:45:15.960
gotten the slides and stuff, you
are empowered to test it yourself.

00:45:15.960 --> 00:45:21.620
Or hit me up on LinkedIn or on
just email or on Slack or whatever.

00:45:21.620 --> 00:45:23.950
And I'll go through it with you.

00:45:25.390 --> 00:45:25.990
<v Joost> Perfect.

00:45:25.990 --> 00:45:27.500
It's a great offer.

00:45:27.500 --> 00:45:31.140
I would definitely take you up on
that if I were any of these people.

00:45:32.240 --> 00:45:34.770
The last question I currently
have open, if you have any more,

00:45:34.770 --> 00:45:38.180
don't hesitate to add
them, is from Jerry Ong.

00:45:38.180 --> 00:45:41.500
What's your take on
accessibility of mega menus

00:45:41.500 --> 00:45:45.840
that could have drop downs with
varied layouts and content?

00:45:45.840 --> 00:45:49.660
Avoid mega menus or just apply
the same accessibility techniques?

00:45:52.900 --> 00:45:56.150
<v Deneb> So I'm not a
huge fan of mega menus.

00:45:58.030 --> 00:46:01.200
However, I think they are OK.

00:46:02.440 --> 00:46:06.130
If you make sure that they
avoid those three problems

00:46:06.130 --> 00:46:11.000
that I talked about, screen
reader users would be able to get

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:18.700
into them and go around them.

00:46:18.700 --> 00:46:21.090
Keyboard users would as well,
as long as there's a way

00:46:21.090 --> 00:46:23.640
to suck that mega menu back up.

00:46:25.030 --> 00:46:32.430
If you make a keyboard user tab
all the way through this vast array

00:46:32.430 --> 00:46:38.010
of options in the mega menu,
it's going to be kind of problematic.

00:46:38.010 --> 00:46:44.980
And that's not a great usability
feature, which is one of the reasons

00:46:44.980 --> 00:46:47.320
why I do not like
Mega Menus too much.

00:46:49.450 --> 00:46:54.580
But as long as it's
showing when it's expanded,

00:46:54.580 --> 00:46:58.570
as long as you can get
in there with just having

00:46:58.570 --> 00:47:03.210
and not necessarily
needing to hover over it,

00:47:03.210 --> 00:47:05.270
then I think Mega Menus can be OK.

00:47:06.300 --> 00:47:08.160
<v Joost> Yes, clear.

00:47:08.160 --> 00:47:12.440
Another anonymous attendee is
asking, what about menus on mobile?

00:47:12.440 --> 00:47:14.340
All the examples shared
were for desktop.

00:47:14.340 --> 00:47:15.620
Is there any difference?

00:47:15.620 --> 00:47:18.630
Does that change the
perspective on any of this?

00:47:19.293 --> 00:47:24.310
<v Deneb> So, that is actually
something I should have brought up

00:47:24.310 --> 00:47:25.070
in the presentation.

00:47:25.070 --> 00:47:29.370
You do need to make sure that
your menu works both in desktop

00:47:29.370 --> 00:47:36.550
and mobile for keyboard
navigators and screen readers

00:47:36.550 --> 00:47:38.800
because it is different.

00:47:38.800 --> 00:47:44.360
Typically, your mobile menu
would have a single dropdown.

00:47:44.360 --> 00:47:50.420
I mean, it's the hamburger
button that you click on,

00:47:50.420 --> 00:47:52.770
and that would drop the menu down.

00:47:52.770 --> 00:47:56.000
But you still do need
to make sure that it has

00:47:56.000 --> 00:48:03.350
the proper aria-expanded
attribute, and that it can work

00:48:03.350 --> 00:48:07.660
on keyboard focus, because
sometimes people are going to be,

00:48:07.660 --> 00:48:12.090
just have a really narrow
browser, and they may

00:48:12.090 --> 00:48:13.930
still be using their
keyboard to navigate.

00:48:13.930 --> 00:48:17.980
And so you do need to check
the mobile menu as well.

00:48:17.980 --> 00:48:21.490
So apply the same standards to make
sure that the mobile menu works

00:48:21.490 --> 00:48:22.610
as well.

00:48:22.610 --> 00:48:24.120
<v Joost> Clear.

00:48:24.120 --> 00:48:26.930
Well, with that, we've come
to the end of our questions,

00:48:26.930 --> 00:48:28.370
and thus the end of this session.

00:48:28.370 --> 00:48:32.610
