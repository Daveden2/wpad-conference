<v Amber Hinds> WordPress
Accessibility Day 2023.

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:09.680
CSS + Accessibility:
Inclusion Through User Choice,

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:13.580
with speaker Carie Fisher,
independent accessibility consultant

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:14.850
and trainer.

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:19.570
This presentation was recorded
on September 27th, 2023.

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.650
<v Ben Ogilvie> Hello, everybody.

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:27.540
Welcome or welcome back to
WordPress Accessibility Day 2023.

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:30.390
I'm Ben Ogilvie,
head of accessibility at Arc Touch.

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.020
We help companies of all sizes
create lovable custom apps, websites,

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.490
and connected experiences
used by hundreds of millions

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:37.720
of people every day.

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.110
And I help our teams to do that work
with an accessibility-first approach.

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:45.870
Thank you all so much for joining
us for CSS + Accessibility:

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.430
Inclusion Through User
Choice, with Carie Fisher.

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:51.320
Carie is an experienced author,
speaker, trainer, and developer

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.040
with over 15 years of
technical expertise.

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.830
And as a freelance
accessibility and UX consultant,

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:58.860
she assists both
individuals and companies

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:01.800
in attaining their digital
accessibility objectives.

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.190
Carie is also a PhD candidate
in Human Computer Interactions

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:08.550
at Iowa State University,
specializing in XR technology,

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:11.890
and notably collaborated
with Google's Web.dev team

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.240
to create the evergreen accessibility
course Learn Accessibility,

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.570
which, by the way, is awesome.

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.140
During the session today,
please add your questions

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.358
to the zoom Q&A section
and we'll answer them

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:24.660
at the end of the session.

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:28.800
And you can use the chat section
to connect with other attendees.

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.110
With that, I'll hand over to Carie.

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:32.510
<v Carie Fisher> Thank you, Ben.

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:35.790
And thank you,
WordPress accessibility day.

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.180
I didn't mean to wear the shirt that
matched your logo, but here we are.

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.110
[chuckles]

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:40.680
So it's pretty cool.

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.560
All right, I'm going to go
ahead and share my screen.

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.630
And that introduction was
also kind of obnoxious,

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.910
so apologizing for that too.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.290
I'm busy.

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.330
I do things in accessibility
because it's my passion.

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.170
I really love it.

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.620
But today, I'm going to talk
about something specific

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:04.630
to digital accessibility, which
is called What we can do is CSS.

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:07.340
So I'm going to actually
leave the tabs open

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.890
because I'm going to be doing
some demos throughout today.

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:12.800
It sounds like we're doing
questions at the end.

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.320
So I'll just kind of go through and
then pause for questions at the end.

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.310
So definitely bring it up
if you have any questions.

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.720
I will say also that this is
about the time my kids get home

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.020
from school,
so you may hear some noise

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.190
in the background just temporarily.

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.180
Apologies for that timing.

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:31.980
Bad timing, I guess.

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.100
Speaking of kids,
let's talk first about choice.

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.995
So as a child, one of my
most-treasured memories involves

00:02:38.996 --> 00:02:41.970
sitting under a giant
maple tree in my backyard

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.800
and reading these amazing
Choose Your Own Adventure books.

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.440
On the screen,
I think we have 10 items here.

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.300
Captivating titles like House
of Danger, Cave of Time,

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:59.670
Inside UFO 54-40. So all kinds
of really cool stories that kind

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.230
of happen on these Choose
Your Own Adventure books.

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:03.660
In case you're not really
familiar with them,

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:06.520
let me just take one
second to talk about them.

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:10.630
So they're a series of children's
game books, and the story is written

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:12.800
from a second-person point of view.

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:18.160
So the reader assumes a protagonist
role, and they make the choices.

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.468
So they determine the
main character's action,

00:03:20.469 --> 00:03:24.140
the plot's outcome,
pretty much the whole story.

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:27.470
If you were like me at all, you’d
probably fast forwarded a little bit

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.300
to see if you were going to die,
then you make a different choice.

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:33.490
I may or may not have cheated
a few times like that.

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:34.850
The really cool thing
about these books;

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:37.500
not only were they really
popular in the ‘80s and ‘90s,

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:42.280
but today there's 184 stories, and
they have formats such as Braille,

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.390
and voice-activated interactive-audio
books, so they're really inclusive.

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.310
Fast forward a few years
and, of course, I'm thrilled

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:51.750
to see my own children
reading these books.

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.540
But I never really stopped to
consider why these books were

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:57.180
so engaging until
I became a parent.

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.890
And now I see how this type
of book became so popular

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:03.250
because it's really about choice,
and the freedom of choice.

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:05.610
So if you think back again
to when you were young,

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:08.100
you probably didn't have
much control over your life.

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.390
But when you read a
type of book like this,

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:12.060
suddenly you control everything.

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:15.260
You make all the choices,
you're empowered, you're the master

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:16.260
of your own destiny.

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:22.280
So we make a series of choices
every day: get up early, work out,

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.190
and hit the snooze button.

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:27.150
I did sleep in today,
but I still worked out, so good job.

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:33.070
Made a double-foam latte or
green cafe tea, tabs or spaces.

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:35.180
I'm a tabs kind of person.

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:37.910
These choices,
even the very insignificant ones,

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:41.310
shape our identities, and forms
our perspectives on the world.

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:44.450
And in today's modern landscape,
we've come to expect a broad range

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:47.620
of choices regardless of the products
or services that we're looking at.

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.670
However,
this has not always been the case.

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:52.560
You saw that maybe
come up on the screen,

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.110
but we have the very
first font family.

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:59.010
There used to be only one: Johannes
Gutenberg and the Printing Press

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:00.540
in 1440.

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:07.790
The first set of a web colors, MIT,
the X10R3, which later became X11.

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:10.780
There were only 69 basic shades.

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:14.210
Technically, if you are counting
things like dark-red, you have 138,

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:15.590
but just a limited palette.

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:19.420
Then in 1995,
a United State programmer named

00:05:19.421 --> 00:05:20.710
Brandan Eich developed

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:24.910
a new scripting language called
Mocha, later renamed to LiveScript,

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:27.360
and then also onto JavaScript.

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:33.080
Fast forward to today,
and we have over 650,000 web fonts

00:05:33.081 --> 00:05:34.360
to choose from.

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:42.760
The number of colors in the
HEX system now are 16,177,216,

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:43.520
to be precise.

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:48.380
And I said roughly over
100, let's say,

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:53.330
public JavaScript facing web
frameworks and libraries, right?

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:56.550
There's probably many,
many more that are proprietary.

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:02.620
So thinking about those
concepts of choice.

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:04.380
So this is all great.

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:06.130
Life is the sum of
all your choices.

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:08.460
This quote is on the
screen, by Albert Camus.

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:11.020
He’s a famous French philosopher.

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:13.710
So what happens when
you don't have a choice?

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:15.840
What if that choice is taken away?

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:18.000
How do you respond when
you don't have any choice?

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.250
And not surprisingly,
many studies at all kinds

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:23.540
of different academic areas
have shown that feelings

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:27.330
of powerlessness can lead to
negative outcomes like depression,

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:30.020
anxiety,
a feeling of worthlessness.

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:33.810
So a lot of negative feelings
when choice has been removed

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:34.810
from the equation.

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:38.690
So with the abundance of options
we're used to these days,

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:41.160
and all the positive
aspects of choice

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:44.170
as independent researchers
have found, why is it that

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:48.560
in the digital space, we really often
don't give our users many choices?

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:50.260
By allowing our users
to make choices,

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:53.800
we could help them accomplish tasks,
connect more easily with others,

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:55.030
and ultimately empower them.

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:00.950
What does it mean when we
talk about accessible choice?

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:04.160
That's all good and fine and
generalized in the world,

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:06.250
but what are we talking about
specifically when it comes

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:10.160
to digital accessibility,
and CSS specifically?

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:13.990
The concept of choice gets
more complicated, of course,

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:16.560
when you bring disabilities
into the discussion.

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:19.450
You have to make considerations
for each disability type,

00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:21.350
speaking in a very broad sense.

00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:25.250
But also on the individual level,
based on the day, environment,

00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:30.310
assistive tech, device support,
operating system, browsers, versions,

00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:31.890
settings, et cetera, et cetera.

00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:34.240
It can get a little
bit overwhelming.

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:36.260
But it's up to us
developers and designers

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:39.510
to consider these complex needs
and offer accessible choices.

00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:43.060
Just kind of a side
note, because we all have

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:44.440
to go down a little
bit of a rabbit hole.

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:47.480
But by accessible choice,
I absolutely don't mean one

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:49.961
of the third-party
accessibility overlays

00:07:49.962 --> 00:07:51.910
that you can pop onto your site.

00:07:51.910 --> 00:07:55.970
On the screen, I have a picture of
an old-fashioned [Inaudible 00:07:54]

00:07:55.970 --> 00:07:57.520
snake oil thing.

00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:00.850
The problem with the accessibility
overlays is they just don't work.

00:08:02.010 --> 00:08:04.020
I think of it as snake oil.

00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:07.430
Hayden Pickering actually just
did a web brief video on this,

00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:09.330
which she called Worse than that.

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:13.880
So take a look at that if you want
to see a little bit more opinions.

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:16.620
Otherwise,
things like the Overlay Fact Sheets,

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:20.500
and Should I Use An Accessibility
Overlay are also good references.

00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:24.790
The reason why we don't
like them especially is not

00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:27.150
just because they don't work,
but they don't also improve

00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:28.270
the accessibility.

00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:32.750
So they reinforce discrimination,
they violate using privacy,

00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:36.110
they slow down your performance,
they can create new access barriers

00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:37.110
to your users.

00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:43.600
The question I always ask is, if you
have to use accessibility overlay

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:47.350
on one site, do you also have to
use it on all the other sites?

00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:51.050
Meaning that if I have that
actual need, let's say I need

00:08:51.050 --> 00:08:54.070
to increase the font,
I need that on all the sites.

00:08:54.070 --> 00:08:55.760
I also need it on
my operating system.

00:08:55.760 --> 00:09:00.000
So it could do me
a good on one site,

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.820
but if I don't have that option
beyond, what's the point?

00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:07.770
So if we're not supposed to
use accessibility overlays,

00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:10.990
what should we focus on to increase
accessible choices we do want

00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:12.150
to offer?

00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:13.020
Glad you asked.

00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:13.700
[chuckles]

00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:18.020
There is so much to talk about,
but too much for one talk.

00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:22.040
So in this talk, I'm really
talking about very specific aspects

00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:26.450
at the CSS level that your users
can have the most issues with,

00:09:26.450 --> 00:09:28.520
and you can help support them.

00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:30.480
And if you haven't
already figured it out,

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:34.210
we're talking about
user-focused CSS media features.

00:09:34.210 --> 00:09:35.800
Today,
we're going to do a quick review

00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:41.880
of all the current user-directed
CSS media features, not queries,

00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:44.115
through the demos, and then talk
about current browser support

00:09:44.116 --> 00:09:44.860
for each.

00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:50.370
I've done this talk in the spring
and one other time at WebAIM,

00:09:50.370 --> 00:09:52.580
and every time these,
numbers have changed.

00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:56.990
And so it's a moving target, and
some of these things, depending on

00:09:56.990 --> 00:09:59.800
when you watch this,
may have changed again.

00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:01.790
This is kind of the average
of what it is right now.

00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:04.200
All right.

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:06.250
So first up, color.

00:10:06.250 --> 00:10:09.370
Color is the heart of every design,
and there are numerous studies

00:10:09.370 --> 00:10:13.400
and articles showing perception
of a brand is tied to its colors.

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:16.730
And studies show that up
to 90% of snap judgments

00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:19.330
about products can be
based on color alone.

00:10:19.330 --> 00:10:21.530
So color is very important.

00:10:21.530 --> 00:10:22.910
Then when you start
to think about things

00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:26.510
like the 300 million people
worldwide who are colorblind,

00:10:26.510 --> 00:10:30.190
this is a very large area where
developers and designers can directly

00:10:30.190 --> 00:10:32.860
and immediately impact
web site accessibility.

00:10:35.380 --> 00:10:36.000
All right.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.390
So the first one I'm easing
you into is probably one

00:10:38.390 --> 00:10:42.540
that you've seen before,
This is the light/dark mode.

00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:46.640
So the prefers-color-scheme
is the CSS media feature

00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:48.000
that you would be using.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.680
There used to be three.

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:51.580
There used to be
default light and dark.

00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:53.690
Now the default is the light one.

00:10:53.690 --> 00:10:57.670
So if you don't have anything that
is your default, specifically,

00:10:57.670 --> 00:11:00.450
and you wrote in the light one,
it would also be the default.

00:11:00.450 --> 00:11:03.620
So light is the default, and
that says that basically the user

00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:06.340
has expressed preference
for either a light theme,

00:11:06.340 --> 00:11:10.500
or they've not actively expressed
a preference so it's kind

00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:11.500
of the default.

00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:14.740
Oh, I should have said
sorry before this, too,

00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:19.070
because there are some animated gifts
in this presentation in the middle.

00:11:19.070 --> 00:11:22.680
So if you have any sort
of vestibular disabilities

00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:27.270
or anything related to motion,
just keep that in mind.

00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:32.140
I'll try not to sit on there
for too long as I'm now sitting

00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:32.840
on there for too long.

00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:33.100
[chuckles]

00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:33.690
But there you go.

00:11:33.690 --> 00:11:36.280
All right, so here's the dark one.

00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:38.490
So the prefers-color-scheme dark.

00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:42.680
So essentially that's saying that
the user has expressed a preference

00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:45.110
for that page as a dark theme.

00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:51.900
And typically, you have that lighter
colors against the darker background.

00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:56.100
There are features that may come
up actually; nobody really knows

00:11:56.100 --> 00:12:00.110
for sure, but things like
sepia or gray tones, right?

00:12:00.110 --> 00:12:03.490
There's a lot of different color
schemes that have been proposed

00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:06.276
and talked about,
but nothing is solidly

00:12:06.277 --> 00:12:08.450
in the works that I'm aware of.

00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:12.420
But it's pretty exciting to
think that we can extend it

00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:14.700
beyond this like
light-and-dark concept.

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:18.338
In the demo I'll
show, it's a CodePen,

00:12:18.339 --> 00:12:21.360
and I'll grab that for you all
if you hadn't grabbed it already.

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:29.330
Maybe one of the
moderators grabbed it.

00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:31.140
If not,
I'll kind of grab it for you.

00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:33.751
But this concept of
prefers-color-scheme,

00:12:33.752 --> 00:12:35.430
you can also reverse this.

00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:37.950
Your default can be dark,
and you can write this

00:12:37.950 --> 00:12:39.430
as prefers-color-scheme light.

00:12:40.510 --> 00:12:43.930
The really cool thing about this
though is that with only a few...

00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:48.250
And this is a super-simple
example here, but really,

00:12:48.250 --> 00:12:52.080
to make an alternate theme
that's flipped from, like,

00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:55.330
whatever your default is...
If it started with light, your dark;

00:12:55.330 --> 00:12:59.100
or if you start with dark,
your light ... Alternative theme.

00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:01.860
It doesn't take a lot of code,
because what you're really doing

00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:04.493
is you're reversing it,
but you've already established

00:13:04.494 --> 00:13:05.450
a lot of baselines.

00:13:05.450 --> 00:13:08.260
And as long as you're adhering
to color contrast ratios

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:10.422
that you need to,
you’ll find sometimes

00:13:10.423 --> 00:13:11.990
that it's surprisingly easy.

00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:15.370
In this example,
it's a very small amount of code,

00:13:15.370 --> 00:13:19.220
but literally I've added,
like, four extra lines,

00:13:19.220 --> 00:13:20.680
and now I've got a brand new theme.

00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:25.200
So not very difficult for
that particular example.

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:30.450
So here is the accessible color.

00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:35.480
I'll grab that in the
chat just in case.

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:38.650
All right.

00:13:38.650 --> 00:13:40.250
So you should be able to see that.

00:13:40.250 --> 00:13:44.430
One thing with CodePen,
especially when you're doing testing

00:13:44.430 --> 00:13:48.090
with screen readers in particular,
which we're not doing that today...

00:13:48.090 --> 00:13:53.040
But try the debug or full mode that
usually have an iframe around it.

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:56.180
So I tend to expand it.

00:13:56.180 --> 00:13:57.980
On this accessible
color, we're going

00:13:57.980 --> 00:13:59.920
to be having all
three colors together,

00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:01.860
and I'm just showing
you one example.

00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:05.130
So right now, my default is light.

00:14:05.130 --> 00:14:07.130
And typically, it is not light.

00:14:07.130 --> 00:14:10.330
It is actually dark mode, mostly.

00:14:10.330 --> 00:14:11.790
But I flipped this just for today.

00:14:13.270 --> 00:14:14.030
All right.

00:14:14.030 --> 00:14:19.200
So if I go to my settings on my
Mac, and I go under appearance,

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:21.060
then I just flip to dark.

00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:24.430
And then if I look here,
my theme has changed.

00:14:24.430 --> 00:14:28.600
And if I look at the codes
specific to just dark mode...

00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:30.030
I'm going to scroll
a little bit here.

00:14:30.030 --> 00:14:36.720
You can see, again...
Maybe a couple more lines than four,

00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:38.240
but not very many.

00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:41.760
This is at media,
prefers-color-scheme dark.

00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:44.040
I changed the background
color, and I changed

00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:49.320
some of the character colors,
and that's it, which is pretty cool.

00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:50.320
[chuckles]

00:14:51.570 --> 00:14:54.960
The really cool thing, too, on this
one is that it's super supported.

00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:58.470
We have that 92.06% of supporting.

00:14:58.470 --> 00:15:01.920
These are funny numbers because,
again, these are filtered by just...

00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:06.220
What you see on the screen
is a can I use matrix

00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:10.100
of which browsers and
versions are supporting

00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:12.520
this particular media feature.

00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:16.100
In this case, I have it filtered
to the most popular ones.

00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:19.210
You’ll see something
similar on a different one,

00:15:19.210 --> 00:15:21.230
and the numbers will
be slightly different,

00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:23.330
because you have it
filtered right here.

00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:28.110
Although this can I use was
telling me that essentially 92%.

00:15:28.110 --> 00:15:31.050
And I'm looking at the most
popular browsers, and I'm like,

00:15:31.050 --> 00:15:32.160
This looks great.

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:35.650
There's UC browser for Android
that's not supporting it,

00:15:35.650 --> 00:15:40.050
but it looks like all the other major
browsers are supporting it except

00:15:40.050 --> 00:15:42.220
for that one and Opera
Mini, it looks like.

00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:43.460
So that’s pretty cool.

00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:46.140
So I feel pretty confident
I can use that one.

00:15:47.750 --> 00:15:53.560
The next one, it gets a little bit
more experimental as we go on, right?

00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:55.930
So here is the forced-colors.

00:15:55.930 --> 00:16:00.230
So forced-colors mode is active only
to the colors that are available

00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:01.770
to the author of the system colors.

00:16:01.770 --> 00:16:05.530
So there's certain things you
can use with forced-colors

00:16:05.530 --> 00:16:07.550
and there's certain
things that you can't.

00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:12.070
It reminds me of the Windows high
contrast mode from back in the day.

00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:16.160
Eric Bailey actually
wrote really good article

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:20.260
on this called Windows high
contrast mode, Forced-colors mode,

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:23.050
and CSS custom properties,
which kind of explains this

00:16:23.050 --> 00:16:25.110
in a lot more details.

00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:30.540
But the concepts here are that
we are, again, at media query

00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:32.780
for forced-colors.

00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:36.390
And we have none and active.
Those are kind of the two ones.

00:16:36.390 --> 00:16:39.810
So very same kind of concept where
we're writing a little bit of code.

00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:43.030
Forced-colors equals active.

00:16:43.030 --> 00:16:44.540
We add a little bit
of styling to it.

00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:46.406
And then presumably,
we have something

00:16:46.407 --> 00:16:48.080
that's a little bit more exciting.

00:16:51.060 --> 00:16:56.510
Some of these things that are
a little bit more experimental,

00:16:56.510 --> 00:17:02.150
you're able to see them and
able to demonstrate them

00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:04.720
just using your normal
operating system browser,

00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:06.810
like we just did with light/dark.

00:17:06.810 --> 00:17:08.580
Forced-colors is not one of
those, all right?

00:17:08.580 --> 00:17:09.880
Of course it isn't.

00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:10.730
Why wouldn’t it be?

00:17:10.730 --> 00:17:12.210
Why would it be easy?

00:17:12.210 --> 00:17:14.940
There’s a couple different
ways that you can use this,

00:17:14.940 --> 00:17:16.340
but since I'm using
the Chrome browser,

00:17:16.340 --> 00:17:20.530
I'm going to be using this
thing called the rendering tab.

00:17:20.530 --> 00:17:23.220
So I'm going here,
and I'm just inspecting this.

00:17:30.770 --> 00:17:32.730
This is something
that I have installed.

00:17:33.930 --> 00:17:39.000
I've been doing demos on
this so I make it really big,

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.010
and now I can't find anything.

00:17:40.010 --> 00:17:43.380
Let's make it a little smaller
so I can find my rendering tab.

00:17:44.830 --> 00:17:45.830
It’s not here.

00:17:50.230 --> 00:17:52.300
Where did I put it?

00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:55.780
Let's see if I get it.

00:17:57.810 --> 00:17:59.020
I might have to do
this on the other one.

00:17:59.020 --> 00:18:01.850
I can't find my...
I think it's over here.

00:18:03.250 --> 00:18:04.800
Where is my rendering tab?

00:18:08.165 --> 00:18:09.165
Oops.

00:18:09.990 --> 00:18:13.260
All right, let me grab my
Canary and do that on that one.

00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:14.890
I know that this one will work too.

00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:17.350
Then I will grab the other one.

00:18:17.350 --> 00:18:18.350
Apologies.

00:18:23.630 --> 00:18:26.890
That's the same concept of the
demo, just the different one here.

00:18:26.890 --> 00:18:31.380
All right.

00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:34.500
Sorry, I've been doing a
workshop, and so I've been messing

00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:35.290
with my settings here.

00:18:35.290 --> 00:18:38.037
But there's a tab
that's called rendering

00:18:38.038 --> 00:18:40.130
in here in this Chrome browser.

00:18:40.130 --> 00:18:44.020
And again, there's different ways
to do it for who's supporting

00:18:44.020 --> 00:18:47.160
what particular CSS media feature.

00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:50.640
But this one, if I scroll down,
they have this really cool thing.

00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:53.760
So this is available on regular
Chrome, but I'm just showing it

00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:57.840
in Canary because I know
my settings were set here.

00:18:57.840 --> 00:19:00.250
So you can see different things,
like we saw the light/dark,

00:19:00.250 --> 00:19:03.590
which I could do that here
too, this rendering thing.

00:19:03.590 --> 00:19:05.860
But then I can also go
down to forced-colors,

00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:08.190
which is the one I'm
looking for today.

00:19:08.190 --> 00:19:11.540
So the default is none,
and then the forced-colors active.

00:19:11.540 --> 00:19:15.590
We’ll switch it to that yellow
background with a blueish text,

00:19:15.590 --> 00:19:19.220
and the word is kind of
like a cranberry color.

00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:25.850
All right, jumping back in here.

00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:31.180
If we look here, we can see
the forced-colors media feature

00:19:31.180 --> 00:19:33.530
is pretty supported.

00:19:33.530 --> 00:19:36.490
This one, by the way,
back in the spring, was like at 30%.

00:19:36.490 --> 00:19:39.300
So now we're all the
way up to 87.48%.

00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:43.170
So a lot has changed since we first
were talking about this earlier

00:19:43.170 --> 00:19:44.170
in the year.

00:19:44.770 --> 00:19:47.500
The trick with this one as
well as some of the other ones

00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:50.870
that are more experimental,
not fully supported, is that

00:19:50.870 --> 00:19:54.700
even if that is fully supported in
the browser, your operating system

00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:56.820
might not have that option.

00:19:56.820 --> 00:20:00.020
When it comes to forced-colors,
Safari does have this

00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:05.340
as well on forced-colors too.

00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:07.730
It’s forced-colors... There you go.

00:20:09.070 --> 00:20:12.780
So go to accessibility,
then go to display,

00:20:12.780 --> 00:20:15.070
and then we have some options
here like invert colors.

00:20:16.140 --> 00:20:21.330
We also have some
forced-colors, but not the ones

00:20:22.470 --> 00:20:26.330
that we would have with the windows
machines in the high-contrast mode.

00:20:26.330 --> 00:20:28.990
And then the way that you can just
literally make whatever colors

00:20:28.990 --> 00:20:30.570
that you want in the scheme.

00:20:30.570 --> 00:20:32.780
So Windows high contrast mode.

00:20:32.780 --> 00:20:37.810
Who knew how cutting-edge it
would be, but essentially,

00:20:37.810 --> 00:20:43.680
that one's almost replicating that
concept of that CSS media feature,

00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:44.840
I should say.

00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:48.130
So last one in colors here
is called inverted colors.

00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:52.260
Now this one's very
tricky to demonstrate

00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:56.450
because when you put the filter on,
you won't be able to see the change.

00:20:56.450 --> 00:20:59.420
At least I've been told
you don't see the change.

00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:01.020
You only see it on
the operating system.

00:21:01.020 --> 00:21:04.070
But trust me, or play around
with it and see it on your own.

00:21:04.070 --> 00:21:07.070
This one for sure in
Safari and Mac we can see.

00:21:07.070 --> 00:21:09.740
And you can apply; you
don't need that filter.

00:21:09.740 --> 00:21:11.870
Unfortunately,
the Chrome rendering browser

00:21:11.870 --> 00:21:15.640
does not have inverted colors
as an option, so you might have

00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:17.290
to do that Safari one.

00:21:17.290 --> 00:21:24.210
I think Firefox also supports
that under an experimental flag.

00:21:24.210 --> 00:21:27.980
This is the visual of the
code before I invert it.

00:21:27.980 --> 00:21:32.710
So when I write the code, I'm writing
essentially this green background,

00:21:32.710 --> 00:21:38.990
black text, like a pinky-look out
here, knowing that when it renders,

00:21:38.990 --> 00:21:40.250
it's going to be
rendering the opposite.

00:21:40.250 --> 00:21:43.470
So you have to do a little
bit of mental gymnastics.

00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:48.370
Here, inverted colors, inverted,
I'm writing it with that green

00:21:48.370 --> 00:21:51.380
and the other colors in place.

00:21:51.380 --> 00:21:54.350
But when you put that filter on,
what the people are actually going

00:21:54.350 --> 00:21:57.980
to see is this RebeccaPurple
background, and we're going

00:21:57.980 --> 00:22:02.760
to see the white text, and this,
like, teal with [Inaudible 00:22:00].

00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:05.710
This one, like I said, is a
little bit tricky to demonstrate.

00:22:05.710 --> 00:22:09.620
And I will say also, because I
know someone's going to ask this,

00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:15.110
I did try to do the inverted
colors with the CSS invert.

00:22:15.110 --> 00:22:20.710
Kind of brand new option here,
or newer option, I would say, in CSS,

00:22:20.710 --> 00:22:23.570
but you can't do the opposite.

00:22:23.570 --> 00:22:27.490
Ideally, what you want to write
is this code, like the purple

00:22:27.490 --> 00:22:29.270
with the white and the teal.

00:22:29.270 --> 00:22:32.010
And then you can do
just a CSS invert on it

00:22:32.010 --> 00:22:34.310
and then it would be great,
but it doesn't work like that

00:22:34.310 --> 00:22:35.510
with this particular filter.

00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:39.270
I’m not sure if that's something
that will happen in the future.

00:22:39.270 --> 00:22:40.500
Let's hope maybe it will.

00:22:42.050 --> 00:22:50.050
On Safari, if I pull that one over
and make it big... And, again,

00:22:50.630 --> 00:22:53.520
go back to my system settings
and bring that over here.

00:22:54.690 --> 00:23:01.880
Appearance, accessibility, display.
So inverted colors.

00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:05.100
They have a smart one and they
have a classic one, right?

00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:09.060
I can't tell if you can see this or
not, but I'm guessing that you can't.

00:23:09.060 --> 00:23:10.200
But what I see is the purple.

00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:11.410
So try it if you have it.

00:23:11.410 --> 00:23:14.300
If not,
Firefox has one behind a flag.

00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:17.083
And then there's also
a classic invert,

00:23:17.084 --> 00:23:19.310
which I'm not really quite sure

00:23:19.310 --> 00:23:23.300
how you do that one because it's
not related to the CSS media feature

00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:24.750
that we've been talking about.

00:23:24.750 --> 00:23:30.100
All right,
just a little bit of code.

00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:35.290
So you can see here on the screen,
again, this is a can I use matrix.

00:23:35.290 --> 00:23:39.490
We only have 19.44%
supporting this.

00:23:39.490 --> 00:23:42.210
You can see, again, though,
that there's a flag under Firefox.

00:23:42.210 --> 00:23:45.470
So you can experimentally
also do that one.

00:23:45.470 --> 00:23:47.170
So pretty cool.

00:23:47.170 --> 00:23:50.260
Play around with it if you
don't have Safari and a Mac.

00:23:50.260 --> 00:23:52.090
That is another way.

00:23:52.090 --> 00:23:53.920
So just kind of move on
a little bit more here

00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:55.880
because I don't want
to run out of time.

00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:59.330
Prefers-contrast and
prefers-reduced-transparency.

00:23:59.330 --> 00:24:01.130
So up next is contrast.

00:24:01.130 --> 00:24:03.830
Contrast works in tandem with
color, of course,

00:24:03.830 --> 00:24:06.490
to provide visual
information to our users.

00:24:06.490 --> 00:24:08.880
So without that good color
contrast, all those in place,

00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:12.320
elements like text, icons,
and other important graphics are hard

00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:13.560
to discern.

00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:16.490
And this is mostly with
people who have low vision

00:24:16.490 --> 00:24:18.640
that we're most concerned
with, but there's other kinds

00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:23.030
of vision disorders that could
benefit from high contrast as well.

00:24:23.030 --> 00:24:28.090
But older adults, for instance,
or people using monochrome displays,

00:24:28.090 --> 00:24:30.940
users in certain
lighting situations.

00:24:30.940 --> 00:24:33.160
Someone I was talking
to the other day said,

00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:35.280
When would you use a
monochrome display?

00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:37.950
And it came up with the idea,
like, Oh, maybe a Kindle, right?

00:24:37.950 --> 00:24:42.690
Maybe you have an eReader that's
connected to the web, right?

00:24:42.690 --> 00:24:45.400
So that might be a
monochrome display situation.

00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:50.980
All right, so prefers-contrast,
no preference is the default.

00:24:50.980 --> 00:24:54.010
On the screen, we have a
little bit of a rainbow effect.

00:24:54.010 --> 00:24:57.900
On top of this phrase,
some disabilities are invisible.

00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:04.170
We have the prefers-contrast
more and related code.

00:25:06.830 --> 00:25:10.140
Again, very similar concepts
with the light/dark, you know,

00:25:10.140 --> 00:25:13.870
add a little bit of code and we can
see a completely different visual.

00:25:13.870 --> 00:25:16.970
I think some people know about
the prefers-contrast more

00:25:16.970 --> 00:25:18.600
because that is a setting.

00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:19.280
It is on my Mac.

00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:22.020
I can see that setting,
and it will increase, and it will go

00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:23.230
with that media feature.

00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:27.360
But what I don't see in my operating
system are things like less,

00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:32.050
which is an option, and custom,
which is also an option,

00:25:32.050 --> 00:25:33.650
which is fascinating to me.

00:25:33.650 --> 00:25:37.940
So custom says, I want a specific
set of colors to be used.

00:25:37.940 --> 00:25:40.610
I could say I want everything
to look like a rainbow.

00:25:40.610 --> 00:25:42.740
I want everything to look
orange, right?

00:25:42.740 --> 00:25:46.450
Whatever preference I would like,
I can indicate to the browser

00:25:46.450 --> 00:25:48.720
through my operating
system settings.

00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:50.190
This is what I prefer.

00:25:50.190 --> 00:25:52.610
If you've got that in place,
you can serve that up.

00:25:54.020 --> 00:25:59.180
In this case, we have, again, more
specifics around prefers-contrast.

00:25:59.180 --> 00:26:03.660
So if I go to the contrast,
for example, and, again,

00:26:03.660 --> 00:26:07.710
take a look at the code, get into
a little bit deeper... Let's see

00:26:07.710 --> 00:26:08.830
if I can find the chat there.

00:26:11.690 --> 00:26:14.040
I want everything to look
like [Inaudible 00:26:12].

00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:18.030
That’s the only comment I saw, but,
yes, that would be pretty awesome.

00:26:18.030 --> 00:26:19.340
[Inaudible 00:26:17]

00:26:19.340 --> 00:26:21.080
all the things.

00:26:21.806 --> 00:26:22.226
OK.

00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:24.890
So debug mode, full view.

00:26:24.890 --> 00:26:25.570
All right.

00:26:25.570 --> 00:26:28.690
So here's one of those
ones where I'm going

00:26:28.690 --> 00:26:31.550
to bring up my Canary
again because I'm going

00:26:31.550 --> 00:26:33.010
to see a lot more options here.

00:26:34.060 --> 00:26:38.180
On my Mac, and using my
operating system settings, again,

00:26:38.180 --> 00:26:42.480
I can get here and I can
do increased contrast.

00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:44.840
And when I do that,
I'm going to get a visual

00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:49.700
that looks just like the CSS media
feature styling that I applied.

00:26:49.700 --> 00:26:52.770
But you can see in my settings,
at least, I don't have the option

00:26:52.770 --> 00:26:55.930
for anything beyond
increasing the contrast.

00:26:55.930 --> 00:26:57.930
So what if I wanted less contrast?

00:26:57.930 --> 00:27:02.300
Maybe my eyes are hurting, or maybe
I just prefer the rainbow effect.

00:27:03.340 --> 00:27:05.140
So I could go up down
to my rendering again.

00:27:05.140 --> 00:27:13.140
All right, so CSS
prefers-contrast, no emulation.

00:27:14.090 --> 00:27:19.650
We have the more subtle; the
invisible part gets less invisible.

00:27:19.650 --> 00:27:23.510
We have the less, which all of a
sudden I can't see anything, right?

00:27:23.510 --> 00:27:27.060
And then we have the custom, which
is more of the full rainbow effect.

00:27:28.090 --> 00:27:29.850
You can just play around with this.

00:27:29.850 --> 00:27:31.710
It’s really cool.

00:27:31.710 --> 00:27:34.550
It's just one of those
things that I'm not sure

00:27:34.550 --> 00:27:38.740
when this will be supported fully
in the browser and in the settings.

00:27:38.740 --> 00:27:41.340
So the browsers look like
they're doing great, right?

00:27:41.340 --> 00:27:42.830
They're at 90%.

00:27:42.830 --> 00:27:44.780
They say you can do
all of these things.

00:27:44.780 --> 00:27:49.180
But the reality is, in my operating
system, I can just do more contrast,

00:27:49.180 --> 00:27:51.150
and that's it.

00:27:51.150 --> 00:27:55.570
Yours might be a
little bit different.

00:27:55.570 --> 00:27:59.740
The second one around contrast is
the reduced-transparency reduce.

00:27:59.740 --> 00:28:01.250
So there's a no preference.

00:28:01.250 --> 00:28:04.713
I'm not choosing to
reduce the transparency,

00:28:04.714 --> 00:28:07.980
and then I have the option
to reduce it.

00:28:07.980 --> 00:28:13.090
So again, very similar at media,
prefers-reduced-transparency reduce.

00:28:13.090 --> 00:28:15.130
And in this case,
I just changed the opacity

00:28:15.130 --> 00:28:17.200
and I just made it a
little bit less bright.

00:28:20.110 --> 00:28:21.320
Not supported at all.

00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:21.620
[chuckles]

00:28:21.620 --> 00:28:22.070
zero.

00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:23.480
Sorry about that.

00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:26.830
I wish it was more supported,
but the transparency is not

00:28:26.830 --> 00:28:28.060
being supportive.

00:28:28.060 --> 00:28:32.590
So I'll do no emulation, and let's
get to the transparency one here.

00:28:35.290 --> 00:28:35.960
Not much happens.

00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:37.760
It just becomes a
little bit fuzzier.

00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:45.760
Let's see if I can make it...
Yes, OK.

00:28:47.220 --> 00:28:51.730
With one of these, like, you'll have
to refresh before you can see it.

00:28:51.730 --> 00:28:52.440
That might be the one.

00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:55.030
I'm going to do that
real quick just to see.

00:29:00.220 --> 00:29:03.850
I'm going to close my render
tab, which is fine.

00:29:04.930 --> 00:29:05.580
All right.

00:29:05.580 --> 00:29:06.330
So we'll close that up.

00:29:06.330 --> 00:29:09.910
Now we'll see the next
one, the next section.

00:29:09.910 --> 00:29:12.780
All right.

00:29:12.780 --> 00:29:13.590
So almost done.

00:29:13.590 --> 00:29:17.820
The motion is the last particular
one for the CSS media features.

00:29:17.820 --> 00:29:20.860
And again, these are all the
ones that currently exist.

00:29:20.860 --> 00:29:23.190
It doesn't mean that there aren't
ones coming around the bend,

00:29:23.190 --> 00:29:27.820
or ones that people are thinking
about introducing later.

00:29:27.820 --> 00:29:31.410
But motion, I think,
is a really important one.

00:29:31.410 --> 00:29:32.890
I really love GIFs.

00:29:32.890 --> 00:29:35.080
I love interactive SVGs.

00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:38.790
I love watching videos,
and even those micro movements

00:29:38.790 --> 00:29:40.420
that you have on websites.

00:29:40.420 --> 00:29:44.020
But people with visual disabilities,
like seizure disorders,

00:29:44.020 --> 00:29:46.850
they might have situational
or temporary disabilities

00:29:46.850 --> 00:29:51.030
like [Inaudible 00:29:47], or I
have a migraine that day, right?

00:29:51.030 --> 00:29:54.880
Whatever reason I might not
want to see this kind of motion,

00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:59.040
I have the option to
turn it off or reduce it.

00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:00.270
This is a really interesting one.

00:30:00.270 --> 00:30:03.010
So prefers-reduced-motion,
that might be one

00:30:03.010 --> 00:30:05.570
that you're pretty
familiar with as well.

00:30:05.570 --> 00:30:07.930
So the default is full motion.

00:30:07.930 --> 00:30:14.130
And again, some of these are
violating WCAG motion requirements.

00:30:14.130 --> 00:30:15.870
So just keep this in
mind that this is a demo,

00:30:15.870 --> 00:30:18.000
and that's why we're
on an infinite loop.

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:22.580
But ideally, we would have
that under five seconds, right?

00:30:22.580 --> 00:30:24.760
So the prefers-reduced-motion,
reduce.

00:30:26.350 --> 00:30:30.020
And again, the rainbow effect, I've
kind of made it a little bit slower.

00:30:30.020 --> 00:30:33.300
If you look again, the difference
is the background doesn't change

00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:35.820
at all, and the text
moves a little bit slower.

00:30:39.190 --> 00:30:40.500
So let's go to that one.

00:30:45.587 --> 00:30:45.887
Oh.

00:30:46.270 --> 00:30:48.550
I must have my settings
still on reduce.

00:30:48.550 --> 00:30:54.630
So this one is under accessibility,
display, reduced motion.

00:30:54.630 --> 00:30:58.360
So I knew I had it on reduced because
it was already started as reduced.

00:30:58.360 --> 00:31:00.460
So here's our default.

00:31:00.460 --> 00:31:05.850
And then when we toggle the reduced
motion, the background changes,

00:31:05.850 --> 00:31:06.730
and the words change.

00:31:06.730 --> 00:31:10.510
So if I refresh that, it'll come
in, but at a slower pace.

00:31:10.510 --> 00:31:12.840
And this is the way I
designed it for this demo.

00:31:12.840 --> 00:31:16.220
And there's a purpose to
why it has some movement.

00:31:16.220 --> 00:31:20.430
I think the big problem right now
with prefers-reduced-motion is

00:31:20.430 --> 00:31:22.040
that it's all or nothing, right?

00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:25.230
And I advocate strongly
for this concept

00:31:25.230 --> 00:31:29.850
of prefers-reduced-motion should
probably be no motion at all,

00:31:29.850 --> 00:31:32.580
because you don't know how much
motion is going to cause someone

00:31:32.580 --> 00:31:37.280
to have a seizure or a migraine
or get nauseous, right?

00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:40.670
You don't want to elicit any
kind of physical reaction

00:31:40.670 --> 00:31:43.320
from your people and the audience.

00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:45.819
So prefers-reduced-motion, reduce,

00:31:45.820 --> 00:31:48.760
that's what I would
suggest right now,

00:31:49.780 --> 00:31:53.300
but once we get the idea... And this
one's almost like fully supported,

00:31:53.300 --> 00:31:55.380
92.59%.

00:31:55.380 --> 00:31:57.460
So pretty robust.

00:31:57.460 --> 00:32:02.530
Right now, the defaults have your
motion, prefers-reduced-motion.

00:32:02.530 --> 00:32:04.650
Let's just take away all motion.

00:32:04.650 --> 00:32:08.240
But once we get this concept
of prefers-reduced-data,

00:32:08.240 --> 00:32:10.950
we could have three
steps in our motion,

00:32:10.950 --> 00:32:15.060
which would be the default,
a reduced one, which has a little bit

00:32:15.060 --> 00:32:17.220
of movement, but very small.

00:32:17.220 --> 00:32:19.740
And then you could use
the prefers-reduced-data

00:32:19.740 --> 00:32:22.880
to actually remove all
the motion together.

00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:25.980
So this GIF is not broken;
it's just a still-shot,

00:32:25.980 --> 00:32:29.160
because nothing has happened
on the prefers-reduced-data.

00:32:30.620 --> 00:32:35.190
So again, very much like other
media queries, prefers-reduced-data,

00:32:35.190 --> 00:32:36.820
reduce.

00:32:36.820 --> 00:32:41.540
In this case, I had no
animation, nothing is happening.

00:32:41.540 --> 00:32:43.940
Unfortunately,
this is zero all the way.

00:32:43.940 --> 00:32:45.520
Tons and tons of flags.

00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:47.630
That means it's good,
it means it's experimental,

00:32:47.630 --> 00:32:50.430
that means that maybe
we'll see it in the future.

00:32:50.430 --> 00:32:54.140
This one has a wide-ranging
abilities beyond how I'm showing this

00:32:54.140 --> 00:32:55.420
in the accessibility setting.

00:32:55.420 --> 00:33:01.640
And the sense of bandwidth and
conserving data, this will help a lot

00:33:01.640 --> 00:33:04.600
of people in rural areas,
or people who don't have plans

00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:06.950
that support unlimited data.

00:33:08.140 --> 00:33:11.870
So lots of really cool stuff
coming around the bend.

00:33:11.870 --> 00:33:15.330
Again, you can do this
one on the Canary only.

00:33:15.330 --> 00:33:20.550
That's the only one that's
featured right now on Canary.

00:33:20.550 --> 00:33:23.560
Or you can get some on
Edge, and obviously opera.

00:33:23.560 --> 00:33:25.680
Maybe some flags there;
experimental flags.

00:33:28.470 --> 00:33:32.990
Just a quick recap, we have the
color: prefers-colors-scheme,

00:33:32.990 --> 00:33:35.980
forced-colors, and inverted colors.

00:33:35.980 --> 00:33:38.626
We have the contrast,
which is prefers-contrast,

00:33:38.627 --> 00:33:40.030
and reduced transparency.

00:33:41.232 --> 00:33:43.356
For motion,
we have prefers-reduced-motion,

00:33:43.357 --> 00:33:44.612
and prefers-reduced-data.

00:33:45.740 --> 00:33:50.770
If you're using none of these things,
we're having zero user choices.

00:33:50.770 --> 00:33:55.010
You're saying, I know all
about your user experience

00:33:55.010 --> 00:34:00.130
and I am giving you zero
options, which is, let's face it,

00:34:00.130 --> 00:34:02.090
most sites that we go to, right?

00:34:03.230 --> 00:34:08.230
If we incorporate even the
three that are most supported...

00:34:08.230 --> 00:34:11.300
I was counting that
as 90% or higher ...

00:34:11.300 --> 00:34:15.590
That gives your users a
combination of 16 choices.

00:34:15.590 --> 00:34:18.460
It's an exponential thing
because you have multiple choices

00:34:18.460 --> 00:34:21.620
under each different category.

00:34:21.620 --> 00:34:23.460
For two of the categories,
you only have two options;

00:34:23.460 --> 00:34:26.210
but the one color contrast,
you have four, so it equals

00:34:26.210 --> 00:34:28.970
to 16 user choices.

00:34:28.970 --> 00:34:32.130
There's that one, that
forced-colors, it's, like, at 87%.

00:34:32.130 --> 00:34:36.980
So in the future, this would be even
32 choices, which is pretty cool.

00:34:38.370 --> 00:34:41.740
But if we think about the
future, we dream about the future

00:34:41.740 --> 00:34:45.970
with browsers and operating systems
settings all supporting all of these,

00:34:45.970 --> 00:34:49.690
we have a staggering 256 options.

00:34:49.690 --> 00:34:51.560
With just adding
those, what do we have?

00:34:51.560 --> 00:34:57.040
Three, four, five, six,
seven media features?

00:34:57.040 --> 00:34:59.410
So it's pretty exciting.

00:34:59.410 --> 00:35:01.680
So lots of different options.

00:35:01.680 --> 00:35:07.240
Again, there are some things that
can conflict, but this is minimum

00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:10.280
if you had each of them,
because you can also combine things

00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:12.690
to create brand new scenarios.

00:35:12.690 --> 00:35:14.960
So you could have a
prefers-reduced-motion

00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:18.650
just for light,
prefers-reduced-motion just for dark.

00:35:18.650 --> 00:35:23.370
You can imagine the combinations can
extend beyond just those simple ones.

00:35:23.370 --> 00:35:24.890
So this would be a simple number.

00:35:24.890 --> 00:35:29.930
So the number really could go on
to infinity, if we’re being honest.

00:35:29.930 --> 00:35:32.120
So pretty exciting.

00:35:32.120 --> 00:35:33.000
I'm excited about it.

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:34.770
I hope I got you a
little bit excited.

00:35:34.770 --> 00:35:37.670
Maybe you saw some things
that you hadn't seen before.

00:35:37.670 --> 00:35:41.577
But really, this concept
of digital accessibility

00:35:41.578 --> 00:35:43.530
sometimes gets a bad rap

00:35:43.530 --> 00:35:47.530
in our technical digital world,
because people are worried

00:35:47.530 --> 00:35:51.280
about beautiful design,
and cutting-edge functionality.

00:35:51.280 --> 00:35:53.850
But hopefully, we saw today that
it doesn't have to be the case.

00:35:53.850 --> 00:35:55.940
You don't have to
choose one or the other.

00:35:55.940 --> 00:35:59.580
You can customize it,
offer your users choices

00:35:59.580 --> 00:36:02.760
to customize their experience and
include all those amazing things

00:36:02.760 --> 00:36:04.850
and cutting-edge things
you want to think of,

00:36:04.850 --> 00:36:07.360
but then you're also giving it
to them in a responsible way.

00:36:08.550 --> 00:36:11.950
As professionals in the technology
industry, we really should aim

00:36:11.950 --> 00:36:15.320
to make our digital projects
accessible, and offer choices

00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:18.250
to each individual to
customize their experience.

00:36:18.250 --> 00:36:21.670
Our job is to provide options,
and then let the people choose

00:36:21.670 --> 00:36:22.670
their own adventure.

00:36:23.910 --> 00:36:25.160
All right.

00:36:25.160 --> 00:36:26.570
Thanks.

00:36:26.570 --> 00:36:28.200
Sorry, I was trying to rush
through at the end there.

00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:29.800
Hopefully I had given
us time for Q &A.

00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:31.090
 <v Ben> You were great.

00:36:31.090 --> 00:36:32.570
We've got 14 minutes.

00:36:32.570 --> 00:36:34.910
So that was awesome.

00:36:34.910 --> 00:36:37.680
If I had an exploding-head
emoji, [chuckles]

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:40.000
that would be me right now.

00:36:42.190 --> 00:36:44.257
We've got lots of great questions,

00:36:44.258 --> 00:36:46.750
and good amount of
time to tackle them.

00:36:46.750 --> 00:36:51.550
So one that was actually reopened
from a talk a few hours ago,

00:36:51.550 --> 00:36:53.100
because it seemed relevant.

00:36:53.100 --> 00:36:59.050
Faye asked: Is there a specific
contrast ratio for ‘too high’?

00:36:59.050 --> 00:37:03.490
I think you kind of touched on that
with your prefers-contrast less,

00:37:03.490 --> 00:37:05.460
but I don't know if there's
a specific contrast ratio

00:37:05.460 --> 00:37:10.690
that's generally accepted as too
high contrast for some users.

00:37:10.690 --> 00:37:13.550
 <v Carie> I mean,
as long as you're giving options,

00:37:13.550 --> 00:37:14.790
I say you can go all the
way, right?

00:37:14.790 --> 00:37:18.000
You can do your 21-to-1,
which is your black and white.

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:21.470
I will say, like a little caveat
to this... And this is something

00:37:21.470 --> 00:37:23.600
that I don't know if
somebody asked yet.

00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:29.230
But if I had a prefers-contrast,
whatever ratio I had it at,

00:37:29.230 --> 00:37:31.450
and I'm saying, Oh,
this is my accessible version,

00:37:31.450 --> 00:37:35.590
and then my normal default
version is not accessible,

00:37:35.590 --> 00:37:38.170
it doesn't work that way.

00:37:38.170 --> 00:37:41.040
Both versions have to
be accessible and adhere

00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:43.740
to your specific WCAG requirements.

00:37:43.740 --> 00:37:47.720
So whatever it is that you're
following, like 2.1 AA is typical

00:37:47.720 --> 00:37:52.530
for most clients that are private
entities, and things like that,

00:37:52.530 --> 00:37:53.890
and not in the government space.

00:37:54.910 --> 00:37:57.140
I get that question, too,
like, Oh, yes, I'm just going

00:37:57.140 --> 00:37:59.450
to make this reduced-motion on
this side, and this is fine.

00:37:59.450 --> 00:38:00.470
This is all I have to do.

00:38:00.470 --> 00:38:02.630
It's, like, No, no,
you got to do both. [chuckles]

00:38:02.630 --> 00:38:05.240
So there’s not a loophole.

00:38:05.240 --> 00:38:08.470
And maybe in the future,
WCAG will catch up

00:38:08.470 --> 00:38:10.470
to something like the
CSS media features,

00:38:10.470 --> 00:38:14.500
and they may say, Hey, yes, if you
have prefers-reduced-motion version

00:38:14.500 --> 00:38:19.770
of this, then you are exempt from
the motion in the default state.

00:38:19.770 --> 00:38:23.110
Or who knows what they'll say,
but that could be a possibility.

00:38:24.060 --> 00:38:27.040
 <v Ben> Or maybe that your
prefers-contrast-less settings

00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:29.270
should have a maximum contrast.

00:38:29.270 --> 00:38:29.960
 <v Carie> Yes.

00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:33.190
Right now there's nothing that I
know of that are... Because, again,

00:38:33.190 --> 00:38:35.100
these are options, right?

00:38:35.100 --> 00:38:38.780
And it's not really under the
umbrella of accessibility per se,

00:38:38.780 --> 00:38:40.930
but I'm bringing it
there, because why not?

00:38:40.930 --> 00:38:43.140
Like, it's pretty cool
stuff, so let's do it.

00:38:43.734 --> 00:38:44.454
 <v Ben> Love it.

00:38:45.720 --> 00:38:49.150
Jessica asked: Are there
WordPress themes that you're aware

00:38:49.150 --> 00:38:53.370
of that offer user choice in light
or dark theme out of the box?

00:38:53.370 --> 00:38:55.320
 <v Carie> I would not be
able to speak to that,

00:38:55.320 --> 00:38:59.220
but I feel like there's a lot of
smart WordPress people that could.

00:38:59.220 --> 00:38:59.510
[laughs]

00:38:59.510 --> 00:39:00.770
[crosstalk 00:38:59]

00:39:00.770 --> 00:39:01.770
Yes.

00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:04.360
Please help me out.

00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:07.780
So I work with different kinds of
clients in different frameworks,

00:39:07.780 --> 00:39:09.630
and different CMSs even.

00:39:12.250 --> 00:39:17.290
I can't speak at great depth on
that, but I'm sure that there are,

00:39:17.290 --> 00:39:21.670
because there's so many really great
people in the WordPress community

00:39:21.670 --> 00:39:23.210
that are thinking
about accessibility.

00:39:23.210 --> 00:39:25.610
So I'm guessing that they have
some of that built in already.

00:39:27.950 --> 00:39:28.540
 <v Ben> Yes.

00:39:28.540 --> 00:39:32.570
Daniel asked: Are there ways to
track any of these preferences

00:39:32.570 --> 00:39:35.460
or settings in Google
Analytics version 4?

00:39:36.980 --> 00:39:38.060
 <v Carie> That's a good question.

00:39:38.061 --> 00:39:43.290
So it's just like the concept of...
Well,

00:39:43.290 --> 00:39:44.950
maybe it's not just
the same concept.

00:39:44.950 --> 00:39:49.530
But for instance, I could potentially
track a screen-reader user,

00:39:49.530 --> 00:39:53.900
and I could figure out how many
people are using screen readers

00:39:53.900 --> 00:39:55.190
on my site.

00:39:55.190 --> 00:39:58.270
Now, I think it was Twitch
who just got in trouble

00:39:58.270 --> 00:40:01.260
with that not too long ago,
where they were doing that

00:40:01.260 --> 00:40:03.710
just so then they could say,
Oh, we want to support them.

00:40:03.710 --> 00:40:05.400
They were doing it
for positive reasons,

00:40:05.400 --> 00:40:07.820
but you could also see the flip
side, like, Hey,

00:40:07.820 --> 00:40:11.160
nobody is using this,
so we’re not going to support it.

00:40:11.160 --> 00:40:13.260
So I think the same
thing is true here,

00:40:13.260 --> 00:40:16.620
where I would feel a little bit
like, even if you could do it,

00:40:16.620 --> 00:40:17.870
should you do it?

00:40:17.870 --> 00:40:20.780
Because you're talking about user
preferences and user choice, and,

00:40:20.780 --> 00:40:25.660
Am I getting into violations
around privacy? So I would question

00:40:25.660 --> 00:40:27.330
whether you want to.

00:40:27.330 --> 00:40:30.490
I think you probably could,
in some ways, find out some

00:40:30.490 --> 00:40:33.100
of these things because
they're browser statistics.

00:40:33.100 --> 00:40:35.720
I'm guessing, you know,
the Chrome people know,

00:40:35.720 --> 00:40:38.200
but whether you can find
out is a different question.

00:40:38.200 --> 00:40:39.160
 <v Ben> Yes.

00:40:39.160 --> 00:40:41.800
Could and should are
different things sometimes.

00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:43.220
 <v Carie> Definitely.

00:40:43.220 --> 00:40:46.060
 <v Ben> Jerry asked: Are
there color guidelines

00:40:46.060 --> 00:40:49.210
that matches WCAG
requirements for each

00:40:49.210 --> 00:40:51.940
of the media feature
queries relating to color?

00:40:52.820 --> 00:40:53.300
 <v Carie> Yes.

00:40:53.300 --> 00:40:55.500
I think we maybe answered
that one earlier.

00:40:55.500 --> 00:40:56.680
I don't know.

00:40:56.680 --> 00:40:57.880
I mean, right now, there’s not.

00:40:57.880 --> 00:41:00.580
These are separate entities.

00:41:00.580 --> 00:41:02.400
But you could apply your own.

00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:05.100
Maybe create a new,
like, guideline.

00:41:05.100 --> 00:41:06.100
That'd be pretty cool.

00:41:08.150 --> 00:41:12.280
 <v Ben> Andrew asked: Is providing
a theme toggle on your website

00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:14.920
for light or dark
necessary or overkill

00:41:14.920 --> 00:41:17.188
if you're already using
prefers-color-scheme

00:41:17.189 --> 00:41:19.760
to automatically set colors
across your WordPress theme?

00:41:19.760 --> 00:41:23.450
Or is it a good idea because it
helps further support user choice?

00:41:23.450 --> 00:41:24.790
 <v Carie> That's a
really good question.

00:41:24.790 --> 00:41:26.170
Yes, [Inaudible 00:41:25].

00:41:27.700 --> 00:41:31.750
So when light/dark mode wasn't a
thing, you could use a little bit

00:41:31.750 --> 00:41:32.860
of JavaScript code.

00:41:32.860 --> 00:41:36.590
Usually, it’s like turning on and
turning off classes to essentially do

00:41:36.590 --> 00:41:39.530
what we can do in the operating
system settings right now.

00:41:39.530 --> 00:41:41.990
So I think for more like
the experimental ones,

00:41:41.990 --> 00:41:47.040
like prefers-reduced-data,
the ones around the contrast,

00:41:47.040 --> 00:41:50.320
but different options, that would
be pretty cool because those things,

00:41:50.320 --> 00:41:53.420
as we saw in the settings,
aren't always available.

00:41:53.420 --> 00:41:55.790
When you get to ones like
prefers-reduced-motion

00:41:55.790 --> 00:42:00.430
and like light/dark modes,
I feel like we've gotten to a point

00:42:00.430 --> 00:42:02.930
of saturation where
people know where that is.

00:42:02.930 --> 00:42:04.150
I don't want to make assumptions.

00:42:05.650 --> 00:42:08.430
So you could maybe have
both if you wanted to.

00:42:08.430 --> 00:42:11.270
But I'm thinking more of like the
experimental ones are the ones

00:42:11.270 --> 00:42:14.430
that operating systems and
browsers are not fully supporting.

00:42:14.430 --> 00:42:16.110
That'd be kind of cool.

00:42:16.110 --> 00:42:18.084
Because, just like light/dark mode,

00:42:18.085 --> 00:42:20.340
that's how we started
the conversation

00:42:20.340 --> 00:42:21.260
around that one.

00:42:21.260 --> 00:42:22.820
The same thing with reduced motion.

00:42:22.820 --> 00:42:25.730
Like, that's how I first was
introduced to those concepts.

00:42:25.730 --> 00:42:26.580
It's like, Oh, that's cool.

00:42:26.580 --> 00:42:29.410
I'll just toggle it. And now
there's other CSS media feature

00:42:29.410 --> 00:42:30.690
that does this.

00:42:30.690 --> 00:42:33.330
So that's a really tricky question,
though, because that assumes

00:42:33.330 --> 00:42:35.790
that the user knows how
to toggle those on and off

00:42:35.790 --> 00:42:37.140
on their operating system.

00:42:37.140 --> 00:42:43.610
 <v Ben> The way we've done that is
to default to the user's OS level

00:42:43.610 --> 00:42:46.950
or browser-level setting, but also
give them an override control.

00:42:46.950 --> 00:42:48.200
 <v Carie> Yes, that's cool, Yes.

00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:50.540
Like a little cookie,
like a setting cookie.

00:42:50.540 --> 00:42:51.030
 <v Ben> Yes.

00:42:51.030 --> 00:42:54.820
So if that user doesn't happen
to know what an OS setting is,

00:42:54.820 --> 00:42:59.290
they can just switch it on depending
on their need for that day.

00:42:59.290 --> 00:43:01.520
Although, in some cases,
that may be overkill.

00:43:02.060 --> 00:43:02.940
 <v Carie> Talk to Ben.

00:43:02.940 --> 00:43:05.410
It sounds like Ben's
got it figured out.

00:43:05.410 --> 00:43:05.640
[chuckles]

00:43:05.640 --> 00:43:07.870
I do like that combination, yes.

00:43:10.070 --> 00:43:15.060
 <v Ben> Deneb said: Great
job showing browser support.

00:43:15.060 --> 00:43:18.340
I'm curious how many people actually
know how to edit their settings

00:43:19.650 --> 00:43:20.860
to choose those adventures.

00:43:20.860 --> 00:43:21.520
[Inaudible 00:43:20]

00:43:21.520 --> 00:43:22.670
is how often those are used.

00:43:22.670 --> 00:43:24.210
So I guess that's
kind of related to...

00:43:24.210 --> 00:43:26.580
 <v Carie> Let's
just do shrug emoji.

00:43:26.580 --> 00:43:27.802
[laughter]

00:43:27.802 --> 00:43:30.840
I don't know if that's an option
here in the webinar, but yes.

00:43:30.840 --> 00:43:33.710
Some of these, you know,
more of the cutting-edge...

00:43:33.710 --> 00:43:36.040
And by cutting-edge, I mean,
they've been around for a bit,

00:43:36.040 --> 00:43:39.200
but the ones that are starting
to be adapted by the OSs

00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:43.370
or adopted by OSs and the
browsers, it's kind of a little bit

00:43:43.370 --> 00:43:46.090
of a fun Wild West, where we
really don't know how it's going

00:43:46.090 --> 00:43:46.770
to shake out.

00:43:46.770 --> 00:43:48.880
And this is the current state.

00:43:48.880 --> 00:43:50.690
Like I said, in the
spring, there was, like,

00:43:50.690 --> 00:43:52.710
no support for like
the forced-colors.

00:43:52.710 --> 00:43:56.560
And now there's like 80-something,
you know, next time I do this talk.

00:43:56.560 --> 00:44:00.280
You know, down the road a couple
months, you know, surprise,

00:44:00.280 --> 00:44:04.280
maybe it’ll be 100%
somewhere or close.

00:44:04.280 --> 00:44:04.710
[chuckles]

00:44:04.710 --> 00:44:05.670
 <v Ben> Yes.

00:44:05.670 --> 00:44:08.530
Actually, that that reminds
me of a question I had.

00:44:08.530 --> 00:44:10.970
You talked about how every
time you give the talk,

00:44:10.970 --> 00:44:12.160
the features have changed.

00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:12.540
 <v Carie> Yes.

00:44:12.540 --> 00:44:16.790
 <v Ben> How do you keep up with
the evolution of those features

00:44:16.790 --> 00:44:17.890
and new releases?

00:44:17.890 --> 00:44:23.600
And how do you build that into
your process to keep up with that

00:44:23.600 --> 00:44:25.170
on a longer project?

00:44:25.170 --> 00:44:25.500
 <v Carie> Yes.

00:44:25.500 --> 00:44:28.710
And this is only the third
time I've ever given this talk.

00:44:28.710 --> 00:44:31.280
I don't do too many repeat talks.

00:44:31.280 --> 00:44:32.270
This is probably the max.

00:44:32.270 --> 00:44:34.990
Maybe I'll do one more,
but I love the concept.

00:44:34.990 --> 00:44:38.870
But this idea of the can I
use is going to have a lot

00:44:38.870 --> 00:44:39.790
of up-to-date information.

00:44:39.790 --> 00:44:43.780
Although, if you're like a big nerd
and want to be on top of things,

00:44:43.780 --> 00:44:46.180
there are all kinds of communities
that you can join specific

00:44:46.180 --> 00:44:51.380
to those browsers, or dig into those
bug reports, accessibility bugs.

00:44:51.380 --> 00:44:54.690
You know, obviously, some of them in
the browser space that are like 10,

00:44:54.690 --> 00:44:56.370
14 years old, right?

00:44:56.370 --> 00:45:00.240
So don't be surprised to
see some of the, you know,

00:45:00.240 --> 00:45:01.570
pushback against some of those.

00:45:01.570 --> 00:45:03.410
But it's interesting to see.

00:45:03.410 --> 00:45:08.450
There’s some people who are starting
to, at least, on the Chrome side

00:45:08.450 --> 00:45:13.340
and the Mozilla side and the
Safari side, push these things.

00:45:13.340 --> 00:45:15.940
And they're starting to see
the value and how it could be

00:45:15.940 --> 00:45:18.300
for digital
accessibility especially.

00:45:18.300 --> 00:45:23.260
It’s like giving them a
little bit more of a push

00:45:23.260 --> 00:45:26.120
to get these things
integrated into the browser

00:45:26.120 --> 00:45:27.873
and operating systems now.

00:45:27.873 --> 00:45:28.480
 <v Ben> Yes.

00:45:30.200 --> 00:45:33.360
At one point, you also mentioned
that some of them can be in conflict.

00:45:33.360 --> 00:45:40.060
So as a dev, do you have to
then do anything in your code

00:45:40.060 --> 00:45:42.960
to prioritize which
preferences get respected?

00:45:44.900 --> 00:45:46.130
What's your responsibility there?

00:45:47.153 --> 00:45:50.380
 <v Carie> I mean, really, your
responsibility is what you want it

00:45:50.380 --> 00:45:53.200
to be, because like I said,
you don't have any obligation to do

00:45:53.200 --> 00:45:54.060
any of these things.

00:45:54.060 --> 00:45:57.090
So it's this idea of that,
What do you want to do?

00:45:57.090 --> 00:46:00.030
And part of that is talking to
your users and kind of asking them,

00:46:00.030 --> 00:46:02.430
you know, Hey,
what is it that you prefer?

00:46:02.430 --> 00:46:03.550
And then working around that.

00:46:03.550 --> 00:46:06.460
There are going to be certain ones
like the prefers-reduce-motion

00:46:06.460 --> 00:46:09.100
and the light/dark mode
that I think are essential.

00:46:09.100 --> 00:46:13.140
There'll be other ones like the
contrast one, more contrast,

00:46:13.140 --> 00:46:14.140
at least, right?

00:46:14.140 --> 00:46:17.990
So those are the three that I was
thinking of as the bare minimum

00:46:17.990 --> 00:46:20.430
for getting your users
those 16 options.

00:46:20.430 --> 00:46:24.730
I don't think there's any
obligation to anything.

00:46:24.730 --> 00:46:27.540
I don't want to say that,
but just think of it as fun, right?

00:46:27.540 --> 00:46:29.800
This is one of those areas
where I think we can play,

00:46:29.800 --> 00:46:32.440
especially when there aren't
any hard and fast rules.

00:46:32.440 --> 00:46:36.460
So as long as you're adhering,
again, to your WCAG Success Criteria,

00:46:36.460 --> 00:46:41.210
and your levels, and all that
good stuff, this could be a place

00:46:41.210 --> 00:46:43.870
to explore those
options and think about,

00:46:43.870 --> 00:46:47.100
How can we make it that
user experience even greater

00:46:47.100 --> 00:46:53.410
and more enjoyable and delight? Like
a real, true adventure, not a slog.

00:46:53.410 --> 00:46:53.870
[chuckles]

00:46:53.870 --> 00:46:55.560
Isn't that the dream?

00:46:55.560 --> 00:47:00.160
You go to a website or a digital app
and you're just like, This is cool.

00:47:00.160 --> 00:47:00.800
This is awesome.

00:47:00.800 --> 00:47:04.490
I want to show all my friends.
 <v Ben> Yes.

00:47:04.490 --> 00:47:09.010
But it sounds like there's
nothing in the user agent or

00:47:09.010 --> 00:47:12.070
in the browser that necessarily
kind of handles conflict resolution

00:47:12.070 --> 00:47:12.550
that is...

00:47:12.550 --> 00:47:14.460
 <v Carie> Oh, yes.

00:47:14.460 --> 00:47:18.820
There’s certain ones that I've
read that may secede others,

00:47:18.820 --> 00:47:21.370
but then some of them are
on the element level too.

00:47:21.370 --> 00:47:25.250
I'm not remembering off the
top of my head which ones.

00:47:25.250 --> 00:47:30.190
There’s a whole matrix of, like, This
one supersedes this one. But like

00:47:30.190 --> 00:47:32.030
I said, also,
you could chain them together,

00:47:32.030 --> 00:47:35.335
and you could have multiple,
different media features

00:47:35.336 --> 00:47:36.620
on one theme, right?

00:47:36.620 --> 00:47:39.860
So in this particular scenario,
I'm serving this, right?

00:47:39.860 --> 00:47:41.200
And in this one, I'm serving this.

00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:43.650
Like that exponential
kind of concept,

00:47:43.650 --> 00:47:46.720
which hopefully doesn't overwhelm
anyone; that excites people.

00:47:46.720 --> 00:47:51.680
But yes, there's a few
around the forced-colors

00:47:51.680 --> 00:47:53.090
that I remember reading about.

00:47:53.090 --> 00:47:55.340
But experiment is what I would do.

00:47:57.060 --> 00:48:00.040
 <v Ben> I guess then that leads
to, you know,

00:48:00.040 --> 00:48:02.930
my QA team would be asking,
OK, how do we approach

00:48:02.930 --> 00:48:06.190
testing the infinite combinations?
Like,

00:48:06.190 --> 00:48:09.780
where do you draw the line
from your perspective?

00:48:09.780 --> 00:48:12.750
 <v Carie> Yes, I mean, there's
always a line to draw for sure.

00:48:12.750 --> 00:48:15.640
And, you know, this is dreaming
a little bit and talking

00:48:15.640 --> 00:48:19.490
about it like this world
where I'm choosing exactly

00:48:19.490 --> 00:48:22.810
what I want every single time
on every digital products.

00:48:22.810 --> 00:48:24.860
Like, let's go [Inaudible 00:48:24]

00:48:24.860 --> 00:48:27.520
websites, and even made a mobile...
Like, everything.

00:48:27.520 --> 00:48:30.500
I want it to look exactly
what I wanted to look like.

00:48:30.500 --> 00:48:32.520
And maybe we'll get
to that point someday.

00:48:32.520 --> 00:48:36.070
But up until then, you're
going to have some variations.

00:48:36.070 --> 00:48:39.230
Some people will probably push
the envelope a little bit.

00:48:39.230 --> 00:48:43.360
Other one's will be dragging
along begrudgingly behind us

00:48:43.360 --> 00:48:47.980
and saying, like, Hey, guys,
let's get this going. So somewhere

00:48:47.980 --> 00:48:53.600
in the middle of those two scenarios
is probably where you want to be.

00:48:53.600 --> 00:48:55.330
And that sweet spot
will keep changing

00:48:55.330 --> 00:48:59.580
as more browsers are supporting this
and more users are asking for this.

00:48:59.580 --> 00:49:01.560
Because I think that's
another piece of it.

00:49:01.560 --> 00:49:02.609
And because, again,

00:49:02.610 --> 00:49:05.700
we don't want them using
those accessibility overlays.

00:49:05.700 --> 00:49:08.320
We want them to be
making their own choices,

00:49:08.320 --> 00:49:12.350
and having the system that they
want, and the visual interaction

00:49:12.350 --> 00:49:16.890
that they want, but not have to
be dependent on you deciding,

00:49:16.890 --> 00:49:19.990
like, you're going to provide
this through this one program.

00:49:19.990 --> 00:49:23.640
And only you're providing that,
so then when I go to my other site,

00:49:23.640 --> 00:49:26.570
now I'm messed up,
and all my settings are wrong.

00:49:26.570 --> 00:49:29.240
Again, this is part of that too.

00:49:30.430 --> 00:49:33.470
It’s circumventing some of those
issues that come up with that kind

00:49:33.470 --> 00:49:34.210
of product as well.

00:49:35.279 --> 00:49:36.679
 <v Ben> Yes.

00:49:36.680 --> 00:49:37.630
 <v Carie> I have thoughts.

00:49:37.630 --> 00:49:38.590
[laughs]

00:49:38.590 --> 00:49:39.210
I'm sorry.

00:49:39.210 --> 00:49:41.320
I have many thoughts on that.

00:49:41.320 --> 00:49:41.600
[playfully]

00:49:41.600 --> 00:49:44.600
I don't want to be sued,
so I'll just stop on that.

00:49:44.600 --> 00:49:45.600
 <v Ben> Yes.

00:49:45.600 --> 00:49:50.660
So on that note, that does actually
bring us to the end of our time.

00:49:51.830 --> 00:49:54.190
Carie, thank you so much.

00:49:54.190 --> 00:49:55.240
Amazing talk.

00:49:55.240 --> 00:49:58.453

00:49:58.454 --> 00:49:59.650
