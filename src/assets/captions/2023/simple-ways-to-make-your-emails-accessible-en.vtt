Accessibility Day 2023: Simple Ways

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:09.180
to Make Your Emails Accessible
- With Speaker, Gerson Lacdao,

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:11.700
Developer, Desert Wing Design.

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.660
This presentation was
recorded September 28th, 2023.

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:17.700
<v Samitha Chadram> Hi, all.

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:22.620
Welcome back to WordPress
Accessibility Day 2023.

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.960
My name is Samitha Chadram and
I am an accessibility consultant

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:26.960
from India.

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:30.390
Now we are back with
one more new session.

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:37.120
Thank you for joining us for Simple
Ways to Make Your Emails Accessible,

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.650
with Gerson Lacdao.

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:41.100
A little bit about him.

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.920
Gerson is the Lead Developer
at Desert Wing Design,

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.730
a digital agency based in Tucson,
Arizona, that provides web design

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:54.030
and development services from an
accessibility-first perspective.

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.310
Through his work with Desert Wing
Design, and other digital agencies,

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:06.700
Gerson hopes to help make the world
wide web a more inclusive place

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.460
for everyone, regardless of
their ability or disability.

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.310
When he is not busy with client
work, Gerson shares his passion

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.050
for web accessibility with his online
community of Filipino freelancers

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:20.710
and content creators.

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:23.120
Outside the online
[Inaudible 01:21]

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.170
Gerson loves mountain
biking, diving and traveling.

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:27.610
That's interesting.

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:31.070
Please feel free to add your
questions in the Zoom Q&A session

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.440
and we will answer them
at the end of the session.

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.590
Use the chat to connect
with other attendees.

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:37.190
Over to you, Gerson.

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:40.540
 <v Gerson Lacdao> All right.

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:43.780
Thanks for that.

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:49.570
Hello everyone, and welcome to
WordPress Accessibility Day 2023.

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:52.770
I'm happy to be here and
present to you this talk.

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.560
So in this session, I'm going
to share some of the simplest

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.720
but commonly overlooked ways to
help to make your emails accessible.

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.830
First let me make a
very quick introduction.

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.090
My name is Gerson Lacdao.

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.140
I'm a freelance WordPress
developer based in the Philippines.

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.960
I am the head of development
for Desert Wing Design,

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:21.540
a digital agency based in
Tucson, Arizona.

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.260
We create and maintain beautiful
websites for non-profits

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.610
and local businesses using an
accessibility-first approach.

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:34.730
I am also the Founder of Web
Accessibility, Philippines.

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.360
It's a very young online
community that shares

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.600
and teaches web accessibility
to Filipino freelancers.

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.930
And seeing that Nobility
is one of the organizers

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:49.390
of this wonderful event, I thought
it would be a bit relevant to share.

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:53.520
Our team won last year's
accessibility internet rally or AIR.

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:57.480
So for those who don't know,
AIR is a global competition

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.950
where teams around the world create
an accessible website for artists

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.040
and nonprofit organizations.

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:10.490
So I was the Lead Developer for the
Airway team that won first place.

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:13.060
And now let's talk about emails.

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:21.380
So over the years
WordPress has evolved.

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:23.750
It's not just about
websites anymore.

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:28.370
And in a lot of cases developers
and website managers also have

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:30.080
to deal with emails.

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:31.910
So there are transactional emails.

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:40.660
These are commonly the notifications
that we get when someone registers

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:45.190
on your website,
or sends a contact message,

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:48.670
or buys something from
your e-commerce website.

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:52.620
So these are called transactional
emails and these are usually built in

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:56.930
with themes and plug-ins and
even the WordPress core itself.

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:00.770
And there are also marketing
emails, and most

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:03.570
of the time we use third
party services for this,

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:07.000
but there are also some
plug-ins that allow us to create

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.640
and send marketing emails right
from the WordPress dashboard.

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:15.820
So over the course of working
with various teams and clients,

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:18.950
I've learned how
important emails are.

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:22.890
So you can use it to build the
following, nurture your audience,

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:26.390
sell products, services,
subscriptions, announcements,

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:28.280
so basically anything.

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:31.250
You can use it to communicate
with your audience.

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:34.320
But also in the span of time
that I've focused my work

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:40.680
on accessibility, which is around
a couple of years, I've observed

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:43.720
how emails that are
supposed to be simple

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:47.310
and straightforward can be
horrendously inaccessible.

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:50.540
So I know I no longer
need to emphasize

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:55.280
how important web accessibility
is for people with disabilities,

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:59.710
since we've been talking about
it for about almost 24 hours now.

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:04.060
But the inaccessibility of
emails affects every one of us.

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:09.110
So I'm a neurotypical person,
as far as I know, with no disability,

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:12.690
but even I have encountered
numerous emails that just confused

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:14.880
and frustrated me
so much to the point

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:18.120
that I didn't even bother making
an effort to find out what it said.

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:24.150
And a lot of times, this email
contains crucial information,

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:28.100
that not being able to access
them could mean missing out

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:33.040
on important events or missing out
on deadlines, missing payments,

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:35.718
and for a lot of people
with disabilities,

00:05:35.719 --> 00:05:37.400
this happens pretty often.

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:41.820
So for businesses, this could mean
not reaching your potential market

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:46.240
or wasting resources, such as when
you have a beautiful campaign design

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:49.020
and it doesn't work because
it's not accessible.

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:55.340
So you miss your opportunity
to grow your audience,

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:59.910
your brand awareness, your
sales, and even alienating those

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:01.420
who are already subscribed to you.

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:08.180
So before I go ahead and share
how to make emails accessible,

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:11.730
I'd like to point out a very
important information about email,

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:16.130
specifically the design
and development of emails.

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:21.490
So you're probably aware that
we have a standard for the web.

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:25.670
So we have the W3C or the
World Wide Web Consortium.

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:31.140
It's an international organization
that develops the standard

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:32.750
for the World Wide Web.

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:37.390
So we have very good browser
support for modern techniques

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:42.980
and design frameworks because the
W3C sets the standard for the web.

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:47.830
But unfortunately,
this isn't the same for email.

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:52.880
So there's no standard for email,
just like what we have for the web.

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:59.810
What we have are standards set
by individual email providers,

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:02.650
those major stakeholders in email.

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:06.020
So we have Google,
Microsoft, Apple.

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:08.340
So those major players.

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:12.690
And they have their own
standard policies and interests.

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:15.430
They also have their
own rendering engine.

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:19.630
So if you think that the job of
a web developer is difficult,

00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:24.210
because we have to make sure
that the web page is compatible

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:28.210
across different browsers
and operating systems,

00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:30.120
wait till you've tried
email development.

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:38.780
So in this example, I have a
table here that's comparing web

00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:44.400
and email support for standard
HTML, and other things.

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:49.780
So for HTML, we have HTML5
for the web, but for email,

00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:54.300
older versions are recommended
just to maintain compatibility.

00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:57.540
For CSS,
only inline CSS is supported.

00:07:57.540 --> 00:08:01.090
For email,
JavaScript is not supported.

00:08:01.090 --> 00:08:03.470
Audio and video are
not widely supported.

00:08:03.470 --> 00:08:09.580
In fact, I haven't seen any
email with an embedded video.

00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:12.560
I think that's not possible yet.

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:16.160
For fonts,
system fonts are still recommended,

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:19.530
again for maximum compatibility.

00:08:19.530 --> 00:08:25.130
Some email providers allow web
fonts, but it's not widely supported.

00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:28.360
For the layout, now we have
Grid and Flexbox for the web,

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:33.280
but for emails, we're still stuck
with nested tables, which is,

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:36.480
I think, this goes as
far back to the 1990s.

00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:41.320
For images, it's widely supported,
but there are some issues

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:43.240
which I will discuss in a bit.

00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:46.500
For forms,
it's not supported at all.

00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:50.190
You can just link to
a form on a web page.

00:08:50.190 --> 00:08:54.550
And for fallbacks, we do this
a lot with web development,

00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:57.430
but for email it's really a must.

00:08:57.430 --> 00:09:04.140
Like for even the smallest
things like font sizes, spacing,

00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:10.310
we have to mix modern solutions
and really primitive solutions

00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:11.750
just to make emails work.

00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:17.540
So these constraints and limitations
really affect accessibility.

00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:22.280
And I'm hoping that these tips
would help improve the accessibility

00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:23.820
of your emails.

00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:26.510
So let's get started
with text and links.

00:09:26.510 --> 00:09:32.220
I think this is where email
copywriters can really help

00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:33.940
with accessibility.

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:38.910
And this is one of the easiest
accessibility issues to fix.

00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:40.820
So let's get started
with the text alignment.

00:09:42.370 --> 00:09:48.620
So our brains are mostly wired to
read and process left aligned text,

00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:53.640
unless you come from the part of
the world where the text is written

00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:54.830
from right to left.

00:09:54.830 --> 00:09:58.560
But generally, left alignment
is really good for readability

00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:06.560
and accessibility because as
you can see, the beginning

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:13.180
of each line is perfectly
aligned to the left and it's easy

00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:16.640
for our eyes to see where
the next line starts.

00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:21.100
Now for center alignment,
our brain now has

00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:25.540
to make some adjustments just
when we get to the next line.

00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:29.670
Because it starts at different
places, our brain has

00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:31.620
to make an adjustment
for each line.

00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:38.850
For justified alignment, again,
it's good that it starts on the left,

00:10:38.850 --> 00:10:43.720
but justified alignment also
aligns all the text to the right.

00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:50.720
And it's the words in the middle that
have to adjust in terms of spacing.

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:53.246
So as you can see,
there's inconsistency

00:10:53.247 --> 00:10:55.340
in the spacing between the words,

00:10:55.340 --> 00:11:00.240
some have very little spacing,
some have very large spacing.

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:04.040
And it may be trivial
for some of us.

00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:07.550
And we can still read
this without any problem.

00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:13.230
But there are some users who
struggle with alignments like this.

00:11:13.230 --> 00:11:16.890
So center and justified alignments
can be a struggle for some people

00:11:16.890 --> 00:11:17.890
to read.

00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:22.490
So the recommendation is
to use left alignment.

00:11:22.490 --> 00:11:25.920
Center alignment is OK
to use for headings,

00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:29.170
and for maybe a couple of lines.

00:11:29.170 --> 00:11:32.860
But beyond that, I would recommend
using the left alignment.

00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:40.440
For colors,
the problem with colors is that

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:45.250
when you have not enough color
contrast between the text

00:11:45.250 --> 00:11:46.650
and the background.

00:11:46.650 --> 00:11:50.560
So this usually happens with
headings, with custom colors,

00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:54.130
custom background colors,
and width buttons.

00:11:55.830 --> 00:11:58.340
In this example,
I have three buttons

00:11:58.340 --> 00:12:01.350
that have very light
background colors.

00:12:01.350 --> 00:12:06.620
You have light pink, cyan color and
light orange, and the text is white.

00:12:08.830 --> 00:12:13.600
So the fix here is to make
adjustments to the colors itself.

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:17.250
So you can either make the
text color darker as I did

00:12:17.250 --> 00:12:23.970
in the second column, or make
the background color a bit darker

00:12:23.970 --> 00:12:28.830
if you want to stick with
the white text color.

00:12:28.830 --> 00:12:33.950
So you don't actually need to
memorize the color contrast ratio

00:12:33.950 --> 00:12:38.250
that's required for the web
content accessibility guidelines.

00:12:38.250 --> 00:12:43.390
If you're working mostly on browsers,
you can just install an extension

00:12:43.390 --> 00:12:46.840
that checks the color
contrast, and once you run it,

00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:52.510
it will tell you if the colors
in your email are accessible

00:12:52.510 --> 00:12:54.400
or have enough color contrast.

00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:04.940
Text size is important
for readability.

00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:09.920
So my recommendation and
what I always use normally

00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:13.460
for each email is 16
pixels for body text.

00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:17.180
And for not so important content
such as those that you place

00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:23.980
in the footer, the minimum
that I would use is 12 pixels.

00:13:25.530 --> 00:13:30.153
So if possible, I would also
recommend using rem units

00:13:30.154 --> 00:13:31.750
instead of pixels.

00:13:31.750 --> 00:13:39.070
So what rem units does is, it allows
the user to set the size of the text.

00:13:39.070 --> 00:13:43.710
So for example, we have low
vision users or even elderly users

00:13:43.710 --> 00:13:48.200
who would set the text size of their
browser to large or extra large.

00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:50.720
So the rem units
would respect that.

00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:56.980
But if you use pixels, even if
they are set, large text to display

00:13:56.980 --> 00:14:00.890
on the browsers, it is going
to stick with the 16 pixels.

00:14:00.890 --> 00:14:06.510
So if possible, if your email
editor allows it, use RAM units.

00:14:06.510 --> 00:14:11.960
And also allow for good line height,
and white space between paragraphs

00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:14.167
just to have enough breathing room,

00:14:14.168 --> 00:14:16.690
and it's much easier
to read that way.

00:14:20.090 --> 00:14:25.120
Headings and lists are used
to break down the contents,

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:29.680
so make it more organized and
not make it like a huge chunk

00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:34.080
of text that's
immediately overwhelming.

00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:38.470
You haven't even started yet, but
it doesn't sound inviting to read.

00:14:38.470 --> 00:14:42.980
So use headings to break down
your emails into subtopics,

00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:47.840
and the consideration for headings
is not to skip heading levels.

00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:54.000
So if we start with H1 and then for
subtopics in your email, use H2.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.640
And if there are subtopics,
within those sub -topics use H3,

00:14:57.640 --> 00:15:02.640
and so forth until
heading level 6 or H6.

00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:07.840
And for lists, we have
unordered list and ordered list.

00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:11.780
So if you have ideas that you
don't need a specific order,

00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:14.060
you can use unordered list.

00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:21.580
And for step-by-step instructions or
processes, you can use ordered lists.

00:15:21.580 --> 00:15:26.360
So these are usually available
in email editors, in text editors

00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:27.840
of your email software.

00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:32.050
The unordered list is
usually a bullet button

00:15:32.050 --> 00:15:36.420
and the ordered list
is a numbered button.

00:15:39.710 --> 00:15:45.170
So for links, I recommend having
a different color for links

00:15:45.170 --> 00:15:49.570
so that it's easy to spot like
just one glance in the email copy

00:15:49.570 --> 00:15:53.000
and you can determine
that this text is a link.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:58.340
So I use a different color that
stands out between the link

00:15:58.340 --> 00:16:00.590
and the surrounding text.

00:16:00.590 --> 00:16:04.470
And aside from the color,
I also add an underline just

00:16:04.470 --> 00:16:08.820
to add an additional
distinguishing mark for the links.

00:16:11.070 --> 00:16:15.740
I also encourage using descriptive
text instead of very generic

00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:20.550
and vague text in your links
like click here, or read more

00:16:20.550 --> 00:16:23.580
or learn more.

00:16:23.580 --> 00:16:28.190
So those are not very accessible
for screen reader users.

00:16:28.190 --> 00:16:30.890
When they list all the
links in the email,

00:16:30.890 --> 00:16:35.620
they could probably see a
bunch of read more, read more,

00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:35.990
read more.

00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:39.140
So those don't have
any context to them.

00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:41.810
So they wouldn't know
where those links go to.

00:16:41.810 --> 00:16:46.970
So as much as possible, let's use
descriptive text in our links.

00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:53.250
Readability.

00:16:53.250 --> 00:16:58.500
And I think this is where many
email copywriters can really help

00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:01.620
with the accessibility
of your email copy.

00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:05.850
So with readability,
you can use the Hemingway app

00:17:05.850 --> 00:17:11.930
or you can just search for a
Flesch–Kincaid readability score.

00:17:11.930 --> 00:17:17.130
There are a bunch of free
resources that I've seen on Google

00:17:17.130 --> 00:17:18.570
and you can use any of that.

00:17:18.570 --> 00:17:22.160
Just feed the email
copy and run the test

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:28.020
and it will give you feedback on
what reading level your copy is.

00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:32.020
So you can make adjustments
if it gets too high.

00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:34.470
You can make an adjustment
and make sure that...

00:17:34.470 --> 00:17:40.260
I think the recommended reading
level is eighth grade reading level.

00:17:41.780 --> 00:17:44.420
So that's what I would recommend.

00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:48.060
And use simple and plain
language as much as possible.

00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:50.790
Let's avoid using jargon.

00:17:50.790 --> 00:17:54.910
I know this can be really
necessary at times.

00:17:54.910 --> 00:17:59.370
I mean, I manage a website for
scientists and there are some words

00:17:59.370 --> 00:18:06.280
that can be really
foreign to some of us.

00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:09.490
But the important thing
is to just make sure that

00:18:09.490 --> 00:18:15.610
if you use these words, you add
an explanation on what it is.

00:18:15.610 --> 00:18:19.330
So for those who don't know, they
would have an idea on what it is.

00:18:19.330 --> 00:18:21.920
If you have acronyms,
you can also just spell it out.

00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:26.230
And avoid large blocks of text.

00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:29.890
This is also one of the
skills that I would observe

00:18:29.890 --> 00:18:32.250
with email copywriters.

00:18:32.250 --> 00:18:37.230
The good ones can really break
down the message in small chunks

00:18:37.230 --> 00:18:41.240
and it's really easily
digestible for a lot of people.

00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:45.920
So I talked with a person with
ADHD, and this is one of the things

00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:49.840
that I remember them saying that
they're having a hard time with,

00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:55.890
like seeing a large block of text
in email copy or in web copy.

00:18:55.890 --> 00:19:02.010
So make sure to break down your
emails into really digestible chunks

00:19:02.010 --> 00:19:03.150
of paragraphs.

00:19:06.250 --> 00:19:08.220
Now let's go to images.

00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:12.760
So I mentioned earlier that
there's a wide support for images,

00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:16.180
but there's a specific
problem with emails

00:19:16.180 --> 00:19:19.520
that makes it a bit
more inaccessible.

00:19:20.690 --> 00:19:26.800
So email clients don't normally
load images by default.

00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:29.640
You might have observed
this when you open an email

00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:32.710
and you're wondering why the
emails are not loading at all.

00:19:32.710 --> 00:19:37.850
So this is some sort of a security
layer that email providers add.

00:19:39.490 --> 00:19:45.660
When you open an email with images,
the email server has to connect

00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:49.390
or has to ping the server
that stores the images.

00:19:49.390 --> 00:19:52.725
And this is some sort
of acknowledgement

00:19:52.726 --> 00:19:55.410
that your email has been opened.

00:19:55.410 --> 00:19:59.260
So if you're wondering how
email softwares can track

00:19:59.260 --> 00:20:02.780
how you've opened the
email, this is probably it.

00:20:03.790 --> 00:20:07.950
So this is probably not
the problem for some of us,

00:20:07.950 --> 00:20:12.750
but some marketers and some cyber
criminals can actually exploit it.

00:20:12.750 --> 00:20:17.540
They can monitor our email
opening pattern and just use it

00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:18.870
to their own advantage.

00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:21.870
Usually it's malicious.

00:20:21.870 --> 00:20:25.350
So that's the problem
with images in emails.

00:20:25.350 --> 00:20:31.760
And if we're not using an
alternative text, it can be a problem

00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:37.060
because when you open the email
and they don't see the image there,

00:20:37.060 --> 00:20:40.450
if you don't have any text,
they wouldn't they wouldn't know

00:20:40.450 --> 00:20:41.910
what the image is about.

00:20:41.910 --> 00:20:44.110
So some users probably
won't see the link

00:20:44.110 --> 00:20:50.050
where you can load all the
images, and that would make

00:20:50.050 --> 00:20:54.640
your emails not display or not
tell them that you have images

00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:55.640
in your emails.

00:20:57.260 --> 00:21:02.180
So in WordPress, you can easily add
alternative text for your images.

00:21:03.390 --> 00:21:05.380
There's an input field for that.

00:21:06.770 --> 00:21:10.860
And for decorative images,
you don't need to add any alt text,

00:21:10.860 --> 00:21:15.710
because it doesn't add any
valuable information to the email.

00:21:15.710 --> 00:21:23.000
You can just skip the alt
text and you can even hide it

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:24.500
from screen reader users.

00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:29.160
But I guess that's something
that's not always so simple to do.

00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:30.630
So I'm skipping that one.

00:21:32.070 --> 00:21:37.290
For linked images, instead of
describing the image, you should say

00:21:37.290 --> 00:21:39.580
where that link goes.

00:21:39.580 --> 00:21:44.430
So maybe you're linking to the
homepage of your website, or linking

00:21:44.430 --> 00:21:49.250
to the products page or
maybe to a different website.

00:21:50.410 --> 00:21:53.020
So that's what you
should do for links.

00:21:55.910 --> 00:22:01.310
Now there are emails where
it's just one single image.

00:22:01.310 --> 00:22:04.800
I've seen a lot of
e-commerce websites do this.

00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:12.080
Also, even large companies that
have this frequent promotions,

00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:16.530
and they just insert this one
image, send it out to send email

00:22:16.530 --> 00:22:17.810
and that's it.

00:22:17.810 --> 00:22:19.416
So when you open that email,

00:22:19.417 --> 00:22:21.940
especially if it doesn't
have an alt text,

00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:24.920
you're just going to see
this image on the left,

00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:28.050
which is essentially a blank email.

00:22:28.050 --> 00:22:32.950
So if your subscribers don't
know how to load these images,

00:22:35.380 --> 00:22:38.910
instead of seeing this
view on the right,

00:22:38.910 --> 00:22:42.390
where you have a beautifully
designed campaign, they're going

00:22:42.390 --> 00:22:47.430
to see what's on the left
side, which is a blank page.

00:22:47.430 --> 00:22:51.650
So imagine if you're a business
owner or an email marketer

00:22:51.650 --> 00:22:55.350
and you do emails like
this, you don't know

00:22:55.350 --> 00:22:59.340
why you're not getting the
conversions that you're projecting,

00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:03.180
it’s because your emails
are not accessible.

00:23:03.180 --> 00:23:06.870
So the next time you run
your campaign, make sure

00:23:06.870 --> 00:23:11.240
that you don't use
image-only emails.

00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:14.610
As much as possible,
just use a text.

00:23:14.610 --> 00:23:18.710
And if you have to insert
images, make sure that it's only

00:23:18.710 --> 00:23:19.740
when it's necessary.

00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:23.437
So especially for
your call-to-actions,

00:23:23.438 --> 00:23:25.150
those are really important

00:23:25.150 --> 00:23:29.140
to be in text form instead
of images that are linked

00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:31.480
to your landing page.

00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:34.570
So just use text for
your call-to-actions.

00:23:34.570 --> 00:23:40.440
Even if the images don't load, users
can still see the call-to-action.

00:23:44.380 --> 00:23:47.830
Animated GIFs are actually
supported very well.

00:23:49.090 --> 00:23:54.560
I think it's just Outlook
that has some problems

00:23:54.560 --> 00:24:00.320
like not loading the animation,
only the first frame.

00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:02.790
So some versions only
load the first frame

00:24:02.790 --> 00:24:04.640
and not load the entire animation.

00:24:07.550 --> 00:24:12.690
So if the GIF file is really
crucial to your campaign,

00:24:12.690 --> 00:24:16.170
I would recommend just making
sure that the important content

00:24:16.170 --> 00:24:19.620
in the GIF is in the first frame.

00:24:19.620 --> 00:24:23.330
And as with any other images,
you have to provide an alt text,

00:24:23.330 --> 00:24:28.540
what that image is about,
and how it relates to your email.

00:24:29.810 --> 00:24:35.160
And very important thing, never use
flashing animations in your GIF file.

00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:40.770
So you can induce some very
serious physical reactions, nausea,

00:24:40.770 --> 00:24:42.480
vomiting, even seizures.

00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:46.620
So avoid using any type
of flashing animations.

00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:52.080
Now let's go to email code.

00:24:52.080 --> 00:25:00.080
Now this might not be so simple,
but email editors can let us edit

00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:02.550
the HTML code.

00:25:02.550 --> 00:25:05.660
And if there are any email
designers and developers here,

00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:07.070
this would be very useful for them.

00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:11.700
So let's go with the table row.

00:25:11.700 --> 00:25:17.290
So I mentioned earlier that
emails use tables, HTML tables,

00:25:17.290 --> 00:25:20.160
in the design and the layout.

00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:25.070
So the thing with tables is
that screen readers present them

00:25:25.070 --> 00:25:29.470
as a data table to the users.

00:25:29.470 --> 00:25:33.180
So let's go back to one
of our slides earlier.

00:25:34.740 --> 00:25:40.320
So this is a data table where
it presents the differences

00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:41.480
between the web and email.

00:25:42.770 --> 00:25:49.910
So a screen reader would say
something like this to a user.

00:25:49.910 --> 00:25:54.740
So this is a table, and there are
these numbers of columns and rows,

00:25:54.740 --> 00:25:56.890
and these are the headers.

00:25:56.890 --> 00:26:04.720
So for example, in line 5, JavaScript
is fully supported on the web

00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:06.520
and not supported in email.

00:26:08.540 --> 00:26:13.440
On the next line, audio and video
are fully supported on the web,

00:26:14.710 --> 00:26:16.850
but not widely supported in email.

00:26:16.850 --> 00:26:22.810
So that's how screen readers
would present the table to a user.

00:26:22.810 --> 00:26:28.470
So imagine if it presents it like
that, but it doesn't make any sense

00:26:28.470 --> 00:26:32.690
because it's not
presenting actual data.

00:26:32.690 --> 00:26:40.690
For tables that are used for design
and layout, the simple fix is

00:26:43.850 --> 00:26:50.140
to add this attribute called role,
and the value is presentation.

00:26:50.140 --> 00:26:57.360
So you can find any instances
of table that's used for layout

00:26:57.360 --> 00:26:59.310
and add role equals presentation.

00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:07.240
And it would omit the
table part to the user.

00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:11.870
So they wouldn't say this is a
table, they would just present

00:27:11.870 --> 00:27:15.040
what's inside of the table,
so just the contents.

00:27:19.090 --> 00:27:23.851
For semantic HTML,
this is really important even

00:27:23.852 --> 00:27:26.280
in the web and in email.

00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:30.790
Semantic HTML allows screen
readers to understand the content

00:27:30.790 --> 00:27:35.790
of your email and the organization,
the hierarchy of your email content.

00:27:36.870 --> 00:27:41.580
So instead of typing your
heading as a normal paragraph

00:27:41.580 --> 00:27:46.300
and then increasing its size and
then changing the color, making it

00:27:46.300 --> 00:27:50.510
into a bold format, instead of
doing that, just select the text

00:27:50.510 --> 00:27:57.720
and in your email editor,
choose heading as the element.

00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:03.760
So we have several levels
of headings, from H1 to H6,

00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:06.360
so use the proper heading level.

00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:12.250
And for ordered and unordered
list, we also have an element

00:28:12.250 --> 00:28:15.270
for each of those as
I mentioned before.

00:28:15.270 --> 00:28:19.970
And for paragraphs,
instead of using line breaks,

00:28:19.970 --> 00:28:25.390
where you press enter twice to
sort of start a new paragraph,

00:28:26.810 --> 00:28:28.780
you should use paragraphs instead.

00:28:30.180 --> 00:28:32.520
I think in WordPress,
it isn't a problem.

00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:38.710
When you press enter in
WordPress, a new paragraph starts,

00:28:38.710 --> 00:28:42.190
you don't even have
to press enter twice.

00:28:42.190 --> 00:28:45.700
But with some email editors,
when you enter twice,

00:28:45.700 --> 00:28:48.420
it looks like you're
starting a new paragraph,

00:28:48.420 --> 00:28:52.870
but it's really just adding
a line break to your email.

00:28:52.870 --> 00:28:55.970
So semantically,
that's not correct.

00:28:55.970 --> 00:28:58.890
So starting a paragraph
is the way to go.

00:28:58.890 --> 00:29:03.260
So if you can view the HTML
code of your email, just check

00:29:03.260 --> 00:29:07.010
that you're starting a new
paragraph for each paragraph

00:29:07.010 --> 00:29:08.720
instead of adding a line break.

00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:17.250
Now for our final reminders, the
first one, everyone can contribute

00:29:17.250 --> 00:29:18.910
to accessibility.

00:29:18.910 --> 00:29:23.360
So I normally talk with designers
and developers in my group,

00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:27.470
and this has been a really
great opportunity to speak

00:29:27.470 --> 00:29:30.590
with email copywriters.

00:29:31.645 --> 00:29:35.370
 [INAUDIBLE 29:32]

00:29:36.780 --> 00:29:40.870
accessibility is a
collaborative effort.

00:29:40.870 --> 00:29:43.255
It's not just designers
and developers

00:29:43.256 --> 00:29:45.090
that have this responsibility

00:29:45.090 --> 00:29:48.840
of making our products
accessible, every one of us

00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:52.450
that should make this contribution.

00:29:53.340 --> 00:29:56.520
The second one, write your emails

00:29:56.520 --> 00:30:02.080
with the accessibility first
approach. And this is just empathy.

00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:04.011
If we understand how people

00:30:04.012 --> 00:30:07.230
with disabilities view
and read our emails,

00:30:07.230 --> 00:30:10.310
we can use that as consideration
when writing the emails.

00:30:11.420 --> 00:30:15.120
And last but not the least, spread
the culture of web accessibility

00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:16.760
within your communities.

00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:21.740
So it's one of the best ways to
help make the web an inclusive

00:30:21.740 --> 00:30:23.750
and accessible place.

00:30:23.750 --> 00:30:27.250
So thank you so much
for attending my talk.

00:30:27.250 --> 00:30:31.030
Thank you so much, the organizers
of WordPress accessibility

00:30:31.030 --> 00:30:32.160
for this opportunity.

00:30:34.180 --> 00:30:35.370
 <v Samitha> Thank you, Gerson.

00:30:35.370 --> 00:30:36.490
That's a fantastic thing.

00:30:37.630 --> 00:30:42.100
You have given us great insights
with respect to email accessibility.

00:30:42.100 --> 00:30:46.920
And we have a few questions for you
here with regards to using the REM.

00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:52.360
Is it better than EM, not just
in emails, but also for web?

00:30:56.200 --> 00:31:00.000
 <v Gerson> For font size,
I normally just recommend REM.

00:31:01.010 --> 00:31:04.410
I use EM for spacing.

00:31:04.410 --> 00:31:07.220
So those are the
use cases for each.

00:31:11.020 --> 00:31:12.240
 <v Speaker 1> Sorry, folks.

00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:13.970
Sorry, I'm just interrupting.

00:31:13.970 --> 00:31:17.290
We're having a bit of a
problem with the interpreters.

00:31:18.830 --> 00:31:20.310
If anybody can just
give me a second.

00:31:22.730 --> 00:31:26.430
I am trying to assign the current
interpreter, but I only see Edgar A

00:31:26.430 --> 00:31:27.840
in the list.

00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:32.430
So is the interpreter that's
currently online able to check

00:31:33.490 --> 00:31:34.800
that things are
right on their side?

00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:41.950
Sorry to interrupt everybody.

00:31:48.771 --> 00:31:51.652
 <v Speaker 2> I see the other
interpreter already interpreting.

00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:53.250
 <v Speaker 1> Yes.

00:31:53.250 --> 00:31:55.130
I do see the other
interpreter interpreting,

00:31:55.130 --> 00:31:57.820
but I don't see that interpreter
in the list to be able to select

00:31:57.820 --> 00:32:01.480
and add as an interpreter in Zoom.

00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:06.160
I only see Molly P and Edgar A.

00:32:08.100 --> 00:32:10.410
 <v Speaker 2> Yes,
it should be Molly P.

00:32:10.410 --> 00:32:11.530
 <v Speaker 1> OK.

00:32:11.530 --> 00:32:13.080
Sorry, that's my confusion.

00:32:13.080 --> 00:32:14.080
I apologize.

00:32:22.730 --> 00:32:24.660
No, I can click start.

00:32:24.660 --> 00:32:26.430
Sorry, folks.

00:32:27.141 --> 00:32:27.431
 <v Samitha> OK.

00:32:28.510 --> 00:32:28.860
Thank you.

00:32:28.860 --> 00:32:31.280
Well, there is another
question, Gerson.

00:32:32.870 --> 00:32:36.100
Will a screen reader read
the entire subject line

00:32:36.100 --> 00:32:38.370
and also the preview text?

00:32:39.140 --> 00:32:40.830
 <v Gerson> OK.

00:32:40.830 --> 00:32:44.630
I actually haven't tested this,
but I think if it's available,

00:32:44.630 --> 00:32:45.760
it will read it.

00:32:48.580 --> 00:32:51.770
 <v Samitha> And those screen
readers evaluate the entire email

00:32:51.770 --> 00:32:56.400
in the same way as an entire web
page, so users can skip around

00:32:56.400 --> 00:32:58.350
to different sections
of the email message.

00:33:00.860 --> 00:33:05.210
 <v Gerson> OK, so with the
web, we typically use sections

00:33:06.670 --> 00:33:09.890
to create the regions
in the web content.

00:33:09.890 --> 00:33:12.790
For emails, as I
mentioned, we use tables.

00:33:12.790 --> 00:33:17.790
I think the way screen readers
would skip to different sections is

00:33:17.790 --> 00:33:19.840
through the headings.

00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:23.590
So those are probably one
of the most useful ways

00:33:23.590 --> 00:33:29.290
to help users navigate the
emails or just scan your emails.

00:33:31.260 --> 00:33:32.890
 <v Samitha> Great, thanks for that.

00:33:32.890 --> 00:33:36.960
And we have a couple of
questions in the list.

00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:40.980
Can you set up a style
element inside the email HTML

00:33:40.980 --> 00:33:46.080
so that you don't need to
have all your styles inline?

00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:49.800
Or is this not supported
as well as inline?

00:33:51.810 --> 00:33:56.370
 <v Gerson> What I
actually do is have both.

00:33:56.370 --> 00:34:03.540
So I have a style element in the
header, and I also style in line.

00:34:03.540 --> 00:34:08.030
So as I said, it's really a
headache developing emails.

00:34:10.022 --> 00:34:11.642
 <v Samitha> And it is worth
it, I think.

00:34:13.050 --> 00:34:16.910
Our efforts are useful
for someone else.

00:34:16.910 --> 00:34:18.240
And there is one more.

00:34:18.240 --> 00:34:21.130
So adding role of
presentation on the table

00:34:21.130 --> 00:34:26.370
won't make the whole table
disappear for screen reader users.

00:34:26.370 --> 00:34:28.960
That's what would happen for
images, right?

00:34:30.910 --> 00:34:33.960
 <v Gerson> It doesn't
make the table disappear,

00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:39.960
but it just helps the screen reader
better convey the information

00:34:39.960 --> 00:34:40.620
to the users.

00:34:40.620 --> 00:34:45.400
So instead of presenting
the email as a table,

00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:50.360
it will just announce the
content inside the table.

00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:56.470
 <v Samitha> That's helpful
information, Gerson.

00:34:56.470 --> 00:35:02.480
And thank you for your time and
for giving us a lot of input.

00:35:02.480 --> 00:35:05.390
And thank you all for attending
