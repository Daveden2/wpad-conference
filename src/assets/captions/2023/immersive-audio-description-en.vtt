 AMBER HINDS: WordPress
Accessibility Day 2023.

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:10.220
Immersive Audio Description, with
speakers Tanja Milojevic, co-founder,

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:14.450
GetBraille.com; and Mark Cadigan,
co-founder, GetBraille.com.

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:20.020
This presentation was recorded
on September 28, 2023.

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.590
JULIE JOHNSON: Welcome to
WordPress Accessibility Day.

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:24.800
My name is Julie Johnson.

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.400
I'm an E-learning
Accessibility Specialist,

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.750
and I help run a platform called
Integrate Trauma Informed Network.

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:36.567
So thank you for
joining us as we learn

00:00:36.567 --> 00:00:38.533
about Immersive Audio Description

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:44.967
from Tanja Milojevic
and Mark Cadigan.

00:00:44.967 --> 00:00:50.230
Tanja was born
prematurely in Serbia.

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:54.430
She had retinal detachment due to
incubator use, and was diagnosed

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:58.790
with retinopathy of
prematurely at age one.

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:01.560
She had several surgeries on
both eyes in the United States,

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.740
but the result was
only partial success.

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:06.010
And at the age of five,
she was diagnosed with open

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:09.010
and closed-angle
glaucoma in both eyes.

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:11.780
Her medical visa helped
her make a permanent home

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.640
in the United States with
her family near Boston,

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.990
where she began her
mainstream public education.

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:20.440
Her background is in advocacy,
and that's been essential

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.680
to Tanja's work who attended
public school all her life,

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.600
and learned to advocate for her
rights along with her family.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.690
She set early self-imposed goals
of learning Braille and mobility

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:31.571
in preparation for
the gradual transition

00:01:31.572 --> 00:01:34.160
to losing all her vision later
in life.

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.010
She pushed the school system to
take dual-learning approaches,

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:40.280
and provided both print and Braille
materials in high school and college.

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.620
She also advocated to
improve experiences

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:46.230
of other visually-impaired students
coming into those institutions.

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:49.120
At Simmons College,
Tanja received her guide dog Wendell,

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.590
and developed an audio
production and on-air skills,

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.960
making her own radio dramas,
and starting her own podcast

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.360
called the Lightning Bolt Theater.

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.400
She did internships at the
Constituent Services Office

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:05.920
under Massachusetts governor, Deval
Patrick, WGBH Media Access Group,

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.350
and Easter Seals.

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.680
Tanja graduated from
Simmons College with a major

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:13.810
in Radio Communications, and Special
Education Moderate Disabilities,

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.680
and a BA in English writing.

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.330
And she went on to do
work at Perkins Library

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:20.982
with Braille Production,

00:02:20.983 --> 00:02:24.010
and co-founded the
company GetBraille.com.

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.340
Mark Cadigan, who's a
co-host, was born blind.

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.090
However,
he has never let this limit him.

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.860
That's never let him be a
barrier to his successes.

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.030
He also has a passion for sales.

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.550
And after graduating from Suffolk's
University with a degree in business,

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.700
he was determined to pursue
a career in this field.

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.065
He had a natural talent
for communication,

00:02:50.066 --> 00:02:51.440
and a strong work ethic,

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.040
which he believed would make
him a successful professional.

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.010
Mark's dreams became a reality
when he landed his professional job

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:59.320
as a sales coordinator.

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:06.790
He worked for Access Information
Protected, and then he went on

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:12.180
and noticed that many blind people
still face significant barriers

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.600
in accessing
information technology.

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.840
He saw that Braille,
the tactical writing system used

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.120
by blind people along with
audio description for video

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.160
or multimedia content, was often
unavailable or cost prohibitive.

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.910
This inspired Mark along
with his fiancé, Tanja,

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:30.030
to launch their own
company, Getbraille.com.

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.510
Mark is a passionate advocate for
blind people's rights and inclusion,

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:35.790
and he believes that people with
disabilities, including people

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.050
with visual impairment,
should have the same opportunities.

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:40.830
 TANJA MILOJEVIC: Julie,
I am so sorry to interrupt.

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:43.950
There's been a request that you
slow the pace down a little bit

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:44.500
for the audience.

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.070
Thank you so much.

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:46.400
 JULIE: OK.

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.640
Mark understands there are
significant challenges facing

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:52.789
the blind community,
including discrimination,

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:57.180
limited accessibility, and a lack
of awareness about their needs.

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.460
Mark and Tanja are striving
to eliminate barriers

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:03.400
and make the world more accessible
to others in his situation.

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:14.570
Please feel free to add
any questions to your Q&A

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:17.140
and we'll answer them at
the end of the session.

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:20.270
Please feel free to use the
chat with the other attendees.

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:25.150
 TANJA: Thank you so much.

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:27.070
We are so excited to be here.

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:29.530
I'm going to go ahead
and share my screen

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:36.500
so that I can bring up the
PowerPoint and we'll get started.

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:39.930
Mark and I are really
excited to join you

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:44.910
for our first WordPress
Accessibility Day.

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:48.460
We actually have a website
through WordPress ourselves.

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:51.820
I think most people
do use WordPress.

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:55.280
And we're using the
accessibility-themed website,

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:58.780
just kind of a fun fact,
for Getbraille.com.

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:15.820
So our theme basically for our
website is Braille Production.

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:22.660
And kind of the background of where
we got started is, personally,

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:26.790
I had a background in producing
braille for Perkins School

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:30.170
For The Blind for the
library for seven years.

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:33.900
And then in 2021,
in the middle of the pandemic,

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:40.350
or toward the end of it, I got
hired to work for an AI company.

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:43.320
They do voice cloning.

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:46.480
And the two kind of came
together in my mind:

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:50.740
The translation I'd done in my
past for my family from Serbian

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:55.210
to English as I made
my way through school.

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:59.950
The braille experience and providing
braille materials, and then AI

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:05.130
in the sense of what screen-reading
technology does for me

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:09.740
on a daily basis,
as well as high-quality AI voices,

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:11.320
and then audio description.

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:13.980
So it all sort of came
together for me in a package

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:17.440
where we thought,
Let’s put our skills together

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:23.760
and start offering the service
for those visual impairments,

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:28.450
people who would need such
services as audio description.

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:33.940
Mark, do you want to talk a little
bit about how we got started,

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:35.960
and some of the services
that we're offering?

00:06:36.567 --> 00:06:37.350
 MARK CADIGAN: Yes, definitely.

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:40.300
So my background is more
in sales and business.

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:44.420
And although, as small business
people, we wear many hats.

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:51.240
Tanja tend towards the
production side of things,

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:53.810
and I tend towards the
sales side of things.

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:56.030
Although Tanja helps me with
sales, and I do help tying it

00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:56.980
with production.

00:06:56.980 --> 00:07:03.880
So those are not defined
boundaries by any means.

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:10.410
So we started to get Braille.com,
and I really laid all the groundwork

00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:17.080
in getting a lot of the
corporate minutia set up.

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:22.410
And we really started offering
our services back at the end

00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:26.320
of last year in June.

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:30.130
And we have had several
successful clients so far

00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:33.200
and are definitely looking
to build our clientele.

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:38.230
One of the things that we
do now is video description.

00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:41.930
Our first video-description client,
and hopefully first of many,

00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:43.560
was with the Perkins
School For The Blind.

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:45.910
We described a safety
video for them.

00:07:45.910 --> 00:07:50.270
It's a publicly-available, you
know, corporate office safety video

00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:54.780
for active shooter preparedness;
a little bit of a scary topic.

00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:58.770
But it's important for folks with
visual impairments to be prepared

00:07:58.770 --> 00:07:59.590
as well.

00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:04.850
So we were asked to describe
that video and we did.

00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:08.710
Tanja does a lot of
audio description working

00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:13.950
for other description
vendors as the voice talent.

00:08:13.950 --> 00:08:17.600
So this was our first client
doing the entire project in-house,

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:25.600
from finding the customer,
closing the deal, writing the script,

00:08:27.030 --> 00:08:32.030
recording the script, putting
the audio track over the video,

00:08:33.450 --> 00:08:35.220
delivering the deliverable.

00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:39.250
And based off that experience,
we really hope to deliver more

00:08:39.250 --> 00:08:41.500
of these in the future
to other clients.

00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:46.400
We’re in current discussions with
several public health departments

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:50.350
to do similar for safety video,
and public service announcements

00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:51.220
around the country.

00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:53.940
And we're really looking
forward to the possibilities

00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:57.050
of this becoming a more
widely available service

00:08:57.050 --> 00:08:59.350
for important safety information.

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:05.790
 TANJA: So in explaining
what audio description is,

00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:09.220
in case you haven't
had a lot of exposure,

00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:13.570
or want kind of more context
as to the various types

00:09:13.570 --> 00:09:20.970
of media it could be pertinent
to, the WCAG standards mandate

00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:28.690
that audio description is available
for multimedia, and it's part

00:09:28.690 --> 00:09:33.400
of making a website or web experience
or an app experience accessible

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:35.400
to those with visual impairments.

00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:41.450
In a nutshell, audio description
is an extra track that's added

00:09:41.450 --> 00:09:45.910
into an existing video,
or it could be a live experience,

00:09:45.910 --> 00:09:49.920
it could be a tour,
for example, at a museum.

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:53.740
And it describes the important
elements that are visual

00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:56.410
that one cannot
gather from listening.

00:09:56.410 --> 00:10:03.790
So anything from costume changes
to gestures, facial expressions,

00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:09.260
important scene changes, body
language, things that are important

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:13.120
to understanding the concept
of the video, or the experience

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:15.350
that you're looking
to participate in.

00:10:16.410 --> 00:10:19.560
There are several types
of audio description,

00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:23.930
and this is also summarized
in the WCAG Guidelines.

00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:27.790
There are a couple of ways
that it can be achieved.

00:10:27.790 --> 00:10:31.600
Number one is you can
use descriptive language.

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:35.400
We will be incorporating
videos later.

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:39.760
The share feature at the moment
for share sound is not enabled.

00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:42.660
So I won't be able to
share the videos currently,

00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:44.800
but they will be available after.

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:52.800
One of the videos besides the Active
Shooter Preparedness video was one

00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:57.230
that was developed by Microsoft,
which illustrates audio description

00:10:57.230 --> 00:11:00.580
using descriptive
language during the fact.

00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:04.810
And it's a described video that
explains, in between dialogue,

00:11:04.810 --> 00:11:07.870
what's happening and what
images are being shown.

00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:12.190
But the detail in the descriptive
language of the video seeks

00:11:12.190 --> 00:11:18.972
to help the user understand
that audio description can be

00:11:18.972 --> 00:11:20.090
in real time.

00:11:20.090 --> 00:11:22.110
It can be imposed.

00:11:22.110 --> 00:11:26.570
For example, if you have a
presentation, and you have a chart

00:11:26.570 --> 00:11:30.470
that you're displaying on
a slide deck, you can say,

00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:32.770
This chart trends upward.

00:11:32.770 --> 00:11:40.770
And it shows 1995 to 2005 is
an upward trend of salaries,

00:11:42.650 --> 00:11:44.130
for example.

00:11:44.130 --> 00:11:52.130
User X salary in 1995 was
50,000, and in 2005 was 200,000,

00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:57.870
and it trends up
about 10,000 a year.

00:11:57.870 --> 00:12:00.210
I'm making it up,
but you get the idea.

00:12:00.210 --> 00:12:06.040
You’re describing the main
points of the visual in real time

00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:09.420
as you're explaining it.

00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:14.420
This can also pertain to someone
describing their own appearance

00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:17.410
before a presentation.

00:12:17.410 --> 00:12:20.930
So for example, I can say,
I'm sitting in my booth currently,

00:12:20.930 --> 00:12:25.630
and there's an LED light above
me that's lighting me from above,

00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:27.900
with an open doorway behind me.

00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:30.300
And there is blue
foam on the walls.

00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:37.530
For instance, I'm wearing a black
blouse that's buttoned down.

00:12:37.530 --> 00:12:41.130
I have brown hair,
and I have a headset on.

00:12:41.130 --> 00:12:43.770
And I am a white female in my 30s.

00:12:43.770 --> 00:12:47.600
That's an example of descriptive
language in real time.

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:52.200
Then there are a couple of
other ways to describe videos

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:56.210
that have already been recorded,
for example, or tutorials.

00:12:56.210 --> 00:13:00.100
This can be anything on a website.

00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:04.630
There was a wonderful presentation
before this talking about alt text

00:13:04.630 --> 00:13:07.860
and alternative tags for images.

00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:09.520
That's a form of audio description.

00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:12.380
You're describing pictures
in detail for the viewer

00:13:12.380 --> 00:13:14.880
when they're interacting
with a website

00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:20.200
with their screen-reading technology,
and they'll hear what the post is.

00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:22.990
Audio description can be
applied to social media too.

00:13:22.990 --> 00:13:26.850
This really transcends every
medium available out there.

00:13:27.950 --> 00:13:30.060
The sky's the limit.

00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:34.680
ChatGPT certainly can help us
generate some of this as well.

00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:37.170
There are other forms
of audio description;

00:13:37.170 --> 00:13:39.090
one of them is called standard.

00:13:40.310 --> 00:13:45.190
This is where either
a human narrator...

00:13:45.190 --> 00:13:48.790
Or you could also use
a text-to-speech voice

00:13:48.791 --> 00:13:51.420
for training video,
for instance.

00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:53.000
We'll talk more about that later.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:58.530
That is where you record a clip,
or a narration clip, if you will.

00:13:59.750 --> 00:14:03.780
You record narration that is meant
to fit between bits of dialogue,

00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:06.510
and scene changes, and so forth.

00:14:06.510 --> 00:14:11.370
This has to be nested perfectly
into the time allowed in that video.

00:14:11.370 --> 00:14:14.580
The length of the video
cannot be altered.

00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:18.400
And this description, again,
comes in after the fact.

00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:22.280
So that's to say,
after you've already recorded

00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:23.700
and finalized your video.

00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:29.530
This is a secondary track that gets
layered over the existing video

00:14:29.530 --> 00:14:33.150
that you've already got finalized.

00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:36.580
Then there's extended audio
description, which means

00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:43.020
that the video itself is paused,
make room for additional description.

00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:46.630
In the example we briefly
alluded to for our client

00:14:46.630 --> 00:14:50.050
where we describe the active
shooter video, there's a lot

00:14:50.050 --> 00:14:55.780
of important information that
runs past the viewer very quickly,

00:14:55.780 --> 00:15:01.290
and happens in between the
narrator's descriptions.

00:15:01.290 --> 00:15:05.550
So in those instances,
we had to pause the video to discuss

00:15:05.550 --> 00:15:07.750
what was taking place.

00:15:07.750 --> 00:15:11.120
There were a couple of
instances on text on screen,

00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:14.122
where there was a paragraph
of informative text,

00:15:14.123 --> 00:15:16.025
but there was no time to read it,

00:15:16.026 --> 00:15:18.560
so we'd have to pause
the video to explain

00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:22.300
or read the text out and explain
any relevant action on screen.

00:15:23.350 --> 00:15:25.010
Then there's a hybrid approach.

00:15:25.010 --> 00:15:29.890
In that video particularly that
I just mentioned, we did both.

00:15:29.890 --> 00:15:35.130
So certain sections had enough
space to fit in a subscription,

00:15:35.130 --> 00:15:38.900
certain sections didn't,
so we did a combination of extended

00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:40.540
and standard audio description.

00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:41.540
We call that hybrid.

00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:50.670
Another part of audio description
that we are developing

00:15:50.670 --> 00:15:54.880
at GetBraille is called
Immersive Audio Description,

00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:57.540
and that's almost
like virtual reality.

00:15:57.540 --> 00:16:03.210
So our target audience for that
would be museums, aquariums,

00:16:03.210 --> 00:16:10.460
zoos, cultural centers, where they
want to develop certain exhibits

00:16:10.460 --> 00:16:12.940
that have audio tracks
that not only the blind

00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:19.260
and visually impaired can benefit
from, but honestly, anyone listening,

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:25.610
anyone who's interested; children
who want something more interactive

00:16:25.610 --> 00:16:29.430
or immersive, rather,
can listen to it.

00:16:29.430 --> 00:16:36.310
Imagine an example where someone
is at a shark exhibit and they want

00:16:36.310 --> 00:16:39.400
to hear the movements of
the shark in the water.

00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:42.720
The audio description is
paired with the movements,

00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:45.530
the underwater
movements of the shark.

00:16:45.530 --> 00:16:52.000
The habitats terminology is
used to explain to the student

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:57.270
what they can expect using the terms
that they would be familiar with

00:16:57.270 --> 00:16:59.190
within that curriculum
that they're learning.

00:17:00.890 --> 00:17:05.700
Usually, aquariums and cultural
centers have their own curriculums

00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:08.740
that they like to
develop around exhibits,

00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:10.990
and we would want to
incorporate all of this language

00:17:10.990 --> 00:17:13.780
in addition to
immersive sound effects,

00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:17.390
which sounds like they're
moving around you in 3D,

00:17:17.390 --> 00:17:26.079
as well as multiple narrators, and
various lengths of files per exhibit

00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:27.980
that would be accessed via QR code.

00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:43.347
So we're now on slide three and I’m
trying to.. Oh, the writing process.

00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:45.120
 MARK: Yes, quickly Tanja.

00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:48.520
We are currently designing some of
these immersive audio descriptions

00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:52.810
for a couple of different aquariums
because we're still in negotiations

00:17:52.810 --> 00:17:54.890
where they can't say which
ones yet at this point,

00:17:54.890 --> 00:17:58.340
but you should hear about
it soon when they are live.

00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:06.650
With the Immersive Audio Description,
it is not necessarily describing

00:18:06.650 --> 00:18:08.320
what's happening in the tank.

00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:13.310
Currently, it's a canned description
describing the fish, or the animal

00:18:13.310 --> 00:18:17.540
in the aquarium, and what it may be
doing at any given point in time,

00:18:17.540 --> 00:18:20.726
not necessarily what
it's doing at the point

00:18:20.727 --> 00:18:22.780
that it's being listened to.

00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:26.440
Because fish obviously
don't act on cue.

00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:29.383
So that's a little
bit of a difference

00:18:29.384 --> 00:18:32.100
between immersive audio description

00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:36.140
for aquariums, and other live
exhibits versus the static form

00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:37.840
for multimedia content.

00:18:40.009 --> 00:18:40.596
 TANJA: Yes.

00:18:42.930 --> 00:18:49.750
This kind of segues nice into our
section on the process of writing

00:18:49.750 --> 00:18:51.010
for audio description.

00:18:51.010 --> 00:18:52.773
If you want to talk
about that a little bit,

00:18:52.774 --> 00:18:53.830
I'll be happy to chime in,

00:18:53.830 --> 00:18:58.240
and then I'll discuss the narration
process and the quality control.

00:19:00.233 --> 00:19:02.600
 MARK: All right,
so for writing the audio description

00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:10.310
for canned media such as video or
the like, we would take that video

00:19:10.310 --> 00:19:16.160
and we would watch it with a
sighted describer who would tell us

00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:17.260
what's going on.

00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:19.910
And we would pause it and we'd
capture the various time codes

00:19:19.910 --> 00:19:23.580
that we know what's going
on, and then we would work

00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:28.810
to write those descriptions in
that verbiage in the allotted space

00:19:28.810 --> 00:19:32.860
between dialogue in the show.

00:19:32.860 --> 00:19:36.200
So for instance,
if a gentleman walks into a room,

00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:40.170
and there is a conversation going
about the gentleman where he's

00:19:40.170 --> 00:19:44.350
on his phone, for instance,
it's very hard to say, Gentleman

00:19:44.350 --> 00:19:47.580
on a cell phone walks into a room
if all you have is one second.

00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:50.150
So you got to be creative
with what you can say.

00:19:51.300 --> 00:19:53.850
 TANJA: For example,
in that instance, you can say

00:19:53.850 --> 00:19:58.870
on the cell phone, and then you
would hear the gentleman's voice

00:19:58.870 --> 00:20:03.970
maybe come in, and you could assert
that we're discussing the gentleman

00:20:03.970 --> 00:20:05.810
that's currently
talking on the phone.

00:20:05.810 --> 00:20:12.720
OK, so sometimes you have to use
half sentences or abbreviated texts.

00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:16.030
Of course,
we have to also determine whether

00:20:16.030 --> 00:20:21.140
or not the video would be
best described as an extended

00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:23.230
or standard or both.

00:20:23.230 --> 00:20:27.560
And that's something that we
like to work with the client on

00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:30.540
to make sure everyone's
on the same page.

00:20:30.540 --> 00:20:34.950
But not an exact science,
and don't be afraid to try both

00:20:34.950 --> 00:20:38.940
and get feedback,
or determine if it's a time crunch,

00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:41.780
what the most effective way to
describe something would be.

00:20:43.290 --> 00:20:48.540
In terms of language that
we like to use, I've worked

00:20:48.540 --> 00:20:53.580
with various vendors in the past to
quality-control audio description

00:20:53.580 --> 00:20:56.920
as well as narrate it,
and we're both consumers of it

00:20:56.920 --> 00:20:58.650
on a day-to-day basis.

00:20:58.650 --> 00:21:02.820
There's certain things that we
really enjoy and certain things

00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:07.800
that could be improved upon with
various types of description.

00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:11.690
Although, general rules of thumb
really is, when you're writing,

00:21:11.690 --> 00:21:16.670
to try to keep the language
similar to the content.

00:21:16.670 --> 00:21:20.920
So if it's a video for kids,
for example, you're going to want

00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:26.170
to keep the language at the
same level, vocabulary-wise,

00:21:26.170 --> 00:21:30.362
to the kids that might be
watching it, or the content,

00:21:30.363 --> 00:21:31.810
that video itself.

00:21:31.810 --> 00:21:36.360
Use similar wording,
maybe shorter sentence structures,

00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:40.100
simpler sentence structures,
and have a bouncier delivery.

00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:45.633
Writing and narration
are closely related

00:21:45.633 --> 00:21:47.370
because the narration is going

00:21:47.370 --> 00:21:50.000
to want to match the
tone of the video.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.310
If it's a serious video,
you're going to want

00:21:52.310 --> 00:21:58.320
to sound a little bit more
serious, and neutral, perhaps.

00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:01.580
If it's an action scene,
you're going to want

00:22:01.580 --> 00:22:05.720
to read a little bit faster and
make sure that the energy matches

00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:07.850
what's happening on screen.

00:22:07.850 --> 00:22:13.430
This goes to any live
performance or alt tags even.

00:22:13.430 --> 00:22:18.640
If you're describing an image,
maybe try to use similar language

00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:22.670
for the image that you'll
find on the rest of the page.

00:22:22.670 --> 00:22:26.090
For example, on our website,
GetBraille, we have a page

00:22:26.090 --> 00:22:28.520
all about describing home videos.

00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:34.870
And our alt tags for some of the
images on that page are longer

00:22:34.870 --> 00:22:40.570
and more detailed in
nature, because the goal is

00:22:40.570 --> 00:22:48.410
to give the viewer an inkling into
how much detail we might provide

00:22:48.410 --> 00:22:49.760
to a home video.

00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:52.770
Something that is going
to be meaningful to them,

00:22:52.770 --> 00:22:57.060
versus some of our other pages
that might say GetBraille, logo,

00:22:57.060 --> 00:23:01.100
for instance, and maybe we
didn't describe the entire logo

00:23:01.100 --> 00:23:05.480
because it's simpler and it's on a
page that they may just skip over it.

00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:08.440
It's not as meaningful
to them as graphics

00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:10.720
on a home video audio
description page would be.

00:23:12.610 --> 00:23:16.340
Besides using terminology
and vocabulary to match

00:23:16.340 --> 00:23:19.900
what it is that you're trying to
say, it's (always good?)

00:23:19.900 --> 00:23:21.190
[Inaudible 00:23:19]

00:23:21.190 --> 00:23:23.460
to use transitional words.

00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:29.440
One of these sentences or
half sentences that I like is,

00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:34.710
when describers say another time
or elsewhere. So for example,

00:23:34.710 --> 00:23:41.210
we could be watching a scene in
the morning in someone's kitchen

00:23:41.210 --> 00:23:45.740
and it cuts to another
scene, and maybe it's someone

00:23:45.740 --> 00:23:48.860
in their office building,
but it's not the same person.

00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:49.740
It's a different character.

00:23:49.740 --> 00:23:54.570
You could say, Elsewhere, Lisa
sits in a cubicle typing. Versus,

00:23:54.570 --> 00:23:58.030
In the kitchen,
Zoe flips a pancake.

00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:04.520
Transitional words are very
important because it gives the person

00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:11.790
who's visually impaired sense
of place, of time, and a sense

00:24:11.790 --> 00:24:14.990
of kind of how fast
things are moving.

00:24:14.990 --> 00:24:18.730
And they're also able to keep
track of where people are.

00:24:18.730 --> 00:24:22.480
If it's a flashback, it's important
to say that it's a flashback.

00:24:24.910 --> 00:24:29.660
And there is a lot of
disagreement about whether or not

00:24:29.660 --> 00:24:35.120
to use terminology like a
close-up view, or view pans,

00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:36.400
film terminology.

00:24:37.510 --> 00:24:42.510
We're not so worried about
style in terms of being nitpicky

00:24:42.510 --> 00:24:46.160
about how things are
described with GetBraille.

00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:52.950
For us, it's more like, what is the
best way to convey this information?

00:24:52.950 --> 00:24:57.830
If we're watching a video
specifically about camera angles,

00:24:57.830 --> 00:25:01.810
it would make sense to use
terminology that echoes that.

00:25:01.810 --> 00:25:05.740
So that's just the point, which is
don't worry so much about style.

00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:12.520
As long as you're accurately
portraying diversity in the casting,

00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:17.240
you're portraying the scenery,
and using relevant content

00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:24.540
in your language to make the
topic relevant to the viewer,

00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:29.780
then you've done your job.
Before I really go into narration

00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:32.080
and such, is there anything
else you wanted to add, Mark?

00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:36.040
 MARK: No,
I think that covers it pretty well.

00:25:37.967 --> 00:25:38.500
 TANJA: Great.

00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:42.770
These are very basic
overviews, of course.

00:25:42.770 --> 00:25:47.530
We would be more than happy to
answer any questions in more depth.

00:25:47.530 --> 00:25:51.230
You can always contact us offline.

00:25:51.230 --> 00:25:59.230
In terms of narration, I've done
voiceover for 12-plus years now.

00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:02.370
And as you can see,
right now I'm in my studio.

00:26:02.370 --> 00:26:04.980
I briefly mentioned that earlier.

00:26:04.980 --> 00:26:06.830
So I record here.

00:26:06.830 --> 00:26:09.640
I have several
different microphones.

00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:14.050
One of my favorite microphones
to use is a Sennheiser MKH 416.

00:26:14.050 --> 00:26:18.220
It's a shotgun mic, which means
that it plugs into an XLR,

00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:24.870
basically, output in the back, and
that plugs into an audio interface.

00:26:24.870 --> 00:26:31.440
However, if you're looking to get
started with recording narration,

00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:34.530
you can do that very easily
with a USB microphone.

00:26:35.540 --> 00:26:38.650
A recommendation that I've
found to be pretty useful

00:26:38.650 --> 00:26:44.820
and handle most voice types
well is a Rode NT1A microphone,

00:26:44.820 --> 00:26:48.510
and the USB version of it
has its own preamp in it.

00:26:48.510 --> 00:26:52.270
It's able to boost
the microphone signal.

00:26:52.270 --> 00:26:54.759
It has the ability
to plug in headphones

00:26:54.760 --> 00:26:56.580
into the microphone directly.

00:26:56.580 --> 00:26:59.110
So you're able to hear
yourself, and that's important,

00:26:59.110 --> 00:27:00.675
because when you're recording,

00:27:00.676 --> 00:27:02.970
you don't want to be
too close to the mic.

00:27:02.970 --> 00:27:07.150
Plosives can be very
disruptive to a listener.

00:27:07.150 --> 00:27:12.470
Bad audio... And by that, I mean
background noise, too much echo,

00:27:12.470 --> 00:27:17.290
hiss, bumps, where you're bumping
the microphone or the table.

00:27:17.290 --> 00:27:22.230
Moving around too much during the
recording can add unwanted noise

00:27:22.230 --> 00:27:25.810
in narration at the end in
the audio-description track,

00:27:25.810 --> 00:27:29.440
and that can take away from
the listener experience.

00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:36.150
Not to call out anyone, but there
are examples of this on YouTube,

00:27:36.150 --> 00:27:37.270
for instance.

00:27:37.270 --> 00:27:42.230
If you search audio description
on YouTube, you can find videos

00:27:42.230 --> 00:27:47.160
that various companies have done,
National Parks, and so forth.

00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:51.950
Some of them are better than others,
but it will give you that range.

00:27:51.950 --> 00:28:00.069
You'll hear things like very
loud narration or quiet video.

00:28:00.070 --> 00:28:05.050
Sometimes there will be pops
when the person starts narrating

00:28:05.050 --> 00:28:08.740
and finishes narrating.

00:28:08.740 --> 00:28:14.840
So that can be very disruptive
and hard to follow along

00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:18.470
if you're listening,
and just might take away interest.

00:28:18.470 --> 00:28:22.520
No one wants viewers to stop
watching their content in the middle,

00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:24.020
if you can avoid it.

00:28:24.020 --> 00:28:28.890
So just being careful and practicing
with your audio is important.

00:28:28.890 --> 00:28:31.540
There are free programs of
course to record yourself,

00:28:31.540 --> 00:28:33.580
Audacity being one of them.

00:28:33.580 --> 00:28:40.240
Audacity is an open-source software
that works with both Mac and on PC.

00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:43.290
It works on Linux,
and it's pretty versatile.

00:28:43.290 --> 00:28:46.110
It's accessible
with screen readers.

00:28:46.110 --> 00:28:48.650
A little bit of a learning
curve, but it is doable.

00:28:48.650 --> 00:28:52.550
It's not as much of a learning
curve as Reaper, for example.

00:28:54.030 --> 00:28:56.744
I personally use an
old-school program called

00:28:56.745 --> 00:28:58.160
GoldWave from the ‘90s.

00:28:58.160 --> 00:28:59.610
It's the best.

00:28:59.610 --> 00:29:01.570
I don't know if anyone's
familiar with it,

00:29:01.570 --> 00:29:05.820
but it was designed originally
to capture content from records,

00:29:05.820 --> 00:29:06.780
et cetera.

00:29:06.780 --> 00:29:09.000
But it's a very simple
single-track editor.

00:29:10.830 --> 00:29:13.440
So that's narration in a nutshell.

00:29:16.090 --> 00:29:19.770
If you're just getting
started, just record yourself.

00:29:19.770 --> 00:29:26.470
Some tips on recording environments
are, if you have a closet full

00:29:26.470 --> 00:29:33.570
of clothes or a room that has
rugs, lots of furniture, blankets,

00:29:33.570 --> 00:29:37.300
things like that,
it will naturally dampen sound.

00:29:37.300 --> 00:29:40.800
One way to test if your room has
echo, and it sounds pretty obvious,

00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:47.180
but it's helpful sometimes to
mention, is you just clap sharply.

00:29:47.180 --> 00:29:51.360
If it echoes, you're probably
going to have a bunch of echo

00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:52.570
in your recording.

00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:57.720
So it's pretty easy
to counteract that.

00:29:57.720 --> 00:30:01.060
You can put pillows around your
microphone, a blanket on your desk,

00:30:01.060 --> 00:30:02.520
so on and so forth.

00:30:02.520 --> 00:30:05.110
Move in blankets,
record in your closet.

00:30:05.110 --> 00:30:07.110
It doesn't have to be expensive.

00:30:07.110 --> 00:30:09.770
For the microphone, I mentioned,
for example, the Rode NT1,

00:30:09.770 --> 00:30:12.660
which is around $150.

00:30:12.660 --> 00:30:14.320
But you don't even
have to use that.

00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:18.060
You could get a headset microphone,
if it's a decent headset,

00:30:18.060 --> 00:30:20.090
and you can record with that.

00:30:20.090 --> 00:30:21.330
Got to start somewhere.

00:30:21.330 --> 00:30:25.480
Then of course there's a TTS
option where we'll mention more

00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:29.900
about this later, but there's
a ready-to-use synthetic voice

00:30:29.900 --> 00:30:31.090
for training videos.

00:30:31.090 --> 00:30:35.140
I don't recommend it for
mainstream entertainment

00:30:35.140 --> 00:30:42.460
because TTS doesn't have as
much emotion and subtlety

00:30:42.460 --> 00:30:45.710
as a human narrator,
as human can't be replaced.

00:30:45.710 --> 00:30:46.700
[chuckles]

00:30:46.700 --> 00:30:50.580
So that's kind of
narration in a nutshell.

00:30:52.370 --> 00:30:56.450
From the quality control side,
that's a two-fold process.

00:30:56.450 --> 00:31:01.760
For us at GetBraille, our quality
control, like we said, is we work

00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:04.780
with an individual who's
sighted, who's able

00:31:04.780 --> 00:31:08.830
to give us some background details.

00:31:08.830 --> 00:31:13.480
We do a couple of passes there, just
to make sure we have all the details.

00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:16.580
Then we run the
script by the client,

00:31:16.580 --> 00:31:19.470
and have them check that
out compared to the video,

00:31:19.470 --> 00:31:23.870
give us any [Inaudible 00:31:21].

00:31:23.870 --> 00:31:27.580
TTS is text-to-speech,
so it's a synthetic voice.

00:31:33.510 --> 00:31:36.950
So the client is then able
to go through the script

00:31:36.950 --> 00:31:42.030
and double check that they
agree with the language used,

00:31:42.030 --> 00:31:45.210
that they're happy with the
way things are being described;

00:31:45.210 --> 00:31:47.920
and then if they have any
concerns or want anything added

00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:54.360
into the mix or adjusted,
that's where we would do that.

00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:57.980
It makes the most sense
before recording starts to try

00:31:57.980 --> 00:32:00.160
to iron out the script
as much as possible.

00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:04.040
So the quality control, of course,
is ensuring the audience is going

00:32:04.040 --> 00:32:09.810
to get what they need out of the
experience with the description,

00:32:09.810 --> 00:32:13.480
that they'll understand fully what's
going on visually in the video,

00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:15.880
and that nothing will slip by them.

00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:21.490
They'll get all the same information
that anyone who's sighted

00:32:21.490 --> 00:32:23.460
who's viewing the
video is going to get.

00:32:24.780 --> 00:32:31.366
[crosstalk 00:32:25]

00:32:31.367 --> 00:32:31.780
 MARK: All right.

00:32:31.780 --> 00:32:33.900
Sorry to step on you there, Tanja.

00:32:33.900 --> 00:32:37.570
Tanja is very experienced
with the quality control,

00:32:37.570 --> 00:32:41.110
having been a quality control
person for several other

00:32:41.110 --> 00:32:43.210
commercial audio
description companies.

00:32:44.830 --> 00:32:49.960
It is definitely a key part of
it to go through and make sure

00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:53.070
that it does describe what
you intend to describe,

00:32:53.070 --> 00:32:57.800
and everything that's important to
be described is, in fact, described.

00:32:57.800 --> 00:33:02.090
It doesn't have to be a second set
of eyes, metaphorically or literally.

00:33:02.090 --> 00:33:04.970
It can be just you
going through the video

00:33:04.970 --> 00:33:11.180
for a second time after it's done
and looking for what may be needing

00:33:11.180 --> 00:33:11.780
to be clarified.

00:33:13.667 --> 00:33:15.700
 TANJA: Another
important aspect of having

00:33:15.700 --> 00:33:20.190
the script quality-controlled
before recording starts,

00:33:20.190 --> 00:33:25.730
is you will have a good-working
transcript of that script

00:33:25.730 --> 00:33:31.260
with time codes so that you can
then offer a secondary method

00:33:31.260 --> 00:33:36.960
for your audience to
access this description.

00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:40.740
So if someone is deaf-blind and
they're using a Braille display

00:33:40.740 --> 00:33:48.000
which is like a smaller computer
that has a single line at the bottom

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:53.380
of Braille that refreshes
based on what's being displayed

00:33:53.380 --> 00:33:59.770
on that line at the time... It's
like a teleprompter, but it's all

00:33:59.770 --> 00:34:03.300
in Braille and it changes as
they move through the script.

00:34:03.300 --> 00:34:07.240
This allows someone who's deaf-blind
to understand what's being said,

00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:11.960
as well as how the visuals
appear in the video.

00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:16.070
So that goes a little beyond
the traditional transcript

00:34:16.070 --> 00:34:19.070
that you would
imagine has captions.

00:34:19.070 --> 00:34:23.399
This has all of the
speakers identified,

00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:28.460
as well as the description in between
the dialogue; or if it's extended,

00:34:28.460 --> 00:34:30.450
it's got that info there too.

00:34:30.450 --> 00:34:35.140
So you're just making sure that
you're compliant with WCAG standards.

00:34:37.470 --> 00:34:40.240
Is there anything else you want
to add about quality control?

00:34:40.240 --> 00:34:43.410
I guess the last thing to
say about it on my end is,

00:34:43.410 --> 00:34:47.410
once you've recorded the video,
the [Inaudible 00:34:46],

00:34:47.410 --> 00:34:50.790
mixed everything in, you want to make
sure that your audio sounds good,

00:34:50.790 --> 00:34:55.060
there are no glitches, that the
visuals are lined up with the audio.

00:34:56.290 --> 00:34:58.775
Sometimes if that's
even a millisecond off,

00:34:58.776 --> 00:35:00.130
it can be very jarring.

00:35:00.130 --> 00:35:02.670
You also want to check that
your description is lined up

00:35:02.670 --> 00:35:06.580
as close [Inaudible 00:35:03].

00:35:06.580 --> 00:35:12.780
You have to make decisions
sometimes to make sure that... Like,

00:35:12.780 --> 00:35:15.780
you have to move certain
things a second faster

00:35:15.780 --> 00:35:20.280
or slower before something happens,
because there may not be enough time,

00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:22.320
or the music is too
loud, and you don't want

00:35:22.321 --> 00:35:23.680
to lower the volume too much.

00:35:23.680 --> 00:35:27.900
But those are all decisions you make
with practice and kind of decide

00:35:27.900 --> 00:35:28.520
as time goes on.

00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:30.170
Mark, did you want to add anything?

00:35:30.170 --> 00:35:33.490
 MARK: Yes, there's a couple
questions that popped up

00:35:33.490 --> 00:35:35.100
while you were speaking.

00:35:35.100 --> 00:35:36.720
 TANJA: Yes, I know.

00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:39.170
 MARK: I think we could
probably address those now

00:35:39.170 --> 00:35:40.930
since they pertain to
what we're talking about?

00:35:42.533 --> 00:35:43.280
 TANJA: Yes, go for it.

00:35:43.280 --> 00:35:47.690
 MARK: OK, so our workflow,
how long does it take?

00:35:47.690 --> 00:35:50.490
So probably like maybe
a six to one ratio.

00:35:52.350 --> 00:35:57.980
For a 10-minute video, it's about
at least an hour-plus of work.

00:36:00.020 --> 00:36:06.560
So it's definitely time consuming,
and that mostly because we want

00:36:06.560 --> 00:36:14.560
to be very precise and we want to
make sure that the job is done right.

00:36:16.490 --> 00:36:20.520
Like anything in this
world, quality shows.

00:36:20.520 --> 00:36:24.730
So that's from a
workflow standpoint.

00:36:24.730 --> 00:36:27.100
The other thing is describing
YouTube videos is great.

00:36:27.100 --> 00:36:30.560
Yes, please, if you feel you
have the ability to volunteer

00:36:30.560 --> 00:36:32.490
and do that, please, that is great.

00:36:32.490 --> 00:36:36.660
There is a lot of great contents
on YouTube, and unfortunately,

00:36:36.660 --> 00:36:40.390
a lot of it is not described.

00:36:40.390 --> 00:36:43.540
And People jokingly say they
learned it at YouTube University.

00:36:43.540 --> 00:36:44.700
That is so true.

00:36:44.700 --> 00:36:46.810
But if you can't see the video
to learn how to do something,

00:36:46.810 --> 00:36:51.080
well, not very applicable
to someone in our situation.

00:36:51.080 --> 00:36:53.480
So describe everything you
can, please.

00:36:54.300 --> 00:36:57.430
 TANJA: There's a website
called YouDescribe.org,

00:36:57.430 --> 00:37:03.370
which is intended to help
people describe YouTube videos.

00:37:03.370 --> 00:37:08.600
There are requests that come in
there and forums that pertain to it.

00:37:08.600 --> 00:37:11.890
It's completely free
to register and post.

00:37:11.890 --> 00:37:15.960
The UI, I haven't tried
it with a screen reader.

00:37:15.960 --> 00:37:18.360
It’s a little confusing
to me personally.

00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:19.980
I've looked at it a little bit.

00:37:19.980 --> 00:37:24.670
But from what I've been told
by those who have used it

00:37:24.670 --> 00:37:29.120
who are cited, it seems to
be easy and intuitive to use.

00:37:29.120 --> 00:37:35.720
You can record directly on your
computer and pop the description,

00:37:35.720 --> 00:37:38.110
sync it to the videos,
and then make them available.

00:37:38.110 --> 00:37:39.140
It's pretty cool.

00:37:39.140 --> 00:37:43.110
So if you want practice for
something that's low pressure

00:37:43.110 --> 00:37:51.110
and just to get your feet wet, if
you will, that's a nice way to do it.

00:37:51.260 --> 00:37:56.860
I've changed the slide
over to The Command Line.

00:37:56.860 --> 00:37:59.160
Mark, do you want to talk
a little bit about that?

00:38:01.633 --> 00:38:02.940
 MARK: Yes, definitely.

00:38:02.940 --> 00:38:06.040
I don't know the
answer to the question

00:38:06.040 --> 00:38:08.710
that was just asked
regarding WordPress TV.

00:38:08.710 --> 00:38:10.360
Perhaps somebody else
can speak to that.

00:38:12.570 --> 00:38:13.760
Which section are we on, Tanja?

00:38:14.833 --> 00:38:15.670
 TANJA: The command line.

00:38:16.267 --> 00:38:16.980
 MARK: Yes.

00:38:16.980 --> 00:38:19.240
So Dan [phonetic]

00:38:19.240 --> 00:38:24.930
has been working with us on
this project that we created

00:38:24.930 --> 00:38:31.280
in collaboration with GetBraille and
Empire Captioning to create a script

00:38:31.280 --> 00:38:36.060
that automatically replaces
the audio track in a video

00:38:36.060 --> 00:38:41.040
with the audio-described audio
track, and lines it with the video

00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:46.260
so that we as blind people can
do that quickly and efficiently.

00:38:47.460 --> 00:38:51.460
Most video editing software
by its nature is quite visual

00:38:51.460 --> 00:38:56.100
and does not lend itself to being
used by a screen-reader user.

00:38:56.100 --> 00:38:57.890
And it's also pretty
steep learning curve.

00:38:57.890 --> 00:39:00.920
So we're planning
on launching a class

00:39:00.920 --> 00:39:05.910
on teaching audio description
basics sometime in 2024.

00:39:05.910 --> 00:39:09.900
And this command line script
that we're currently using is

00:39:09.900 --> 00:39:16.010
being further developed by Dan
into a graphical user interface.

00:39:17.050 --> 00:39:18.440
That will be like a wizard.

00:39:18.440 --> 00:39:20.829
So you'll be able to
put your video file

00:39:20.830 --> 00:39:22.810
that you want described in there.

00:39:22.810 --> 00:39:28.750
You'll be able to put the timestamps
for the audio description,

00:39:28.750 --> 00:39:31.610
either the audio
description files themselves

00:39:31.610 --> 00:39:35.460
or the audio description text,
and a text-to-speech engine

00:39:35.460 --> 00:39:38.160
will generate those
audio descriptions.

00:39:38.160 --> 00:39:40.030
And then it will
automatically render the video

00:39:40.030 --> 00:39:42.220
in the audio-described format.

00:39:42.220 --> 00:39:47.440
That's coming sometime in 2024,
and we'll keep you guys posted

00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:48.970
as that progresses.

00:39:49.900 --> 00:39:55.040
 TANJA: The command line current
process that we have is very,

00:39:55.040 --> 00:39:56.040
very cool.

00:39:57.210 --> 00:40:01.700
Essentially, what it is,
we would provide the beginning

00:40:01.700 --> 00:40:06.290
and end timestamps for
however long the clip is going

00:40:06.290 --> 00:40:07.680
to be that gets inserted.

00:40:09.140 --> 00:40:14.690
In a nutshell, the file, when we're
creating the audio description,

00:40:14.690 --> 00:40:17.760
we have to get a sense
of how long we have.

00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:23.460
So when we're scripting the
beginning and the end time codes.

00:40:23.460 --> 00:40:28.950
Also, in my process of working
with other vendors in narrating,

00:40:28.950 --> 00:40:33.000
they always provide beginning
and ending time codes for a file.

00:40:34.100 --> 00:40:40.700
They give you a sentence like, Mary
sits in the airport looking glume,

00:40:40.700 --> 00:40:43.520
and you have two seconds to say it.

00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:46.300
So you have to make sure
that, timing-wise, it fits,

00:40:46.300 --> 00:40:49.010
and it saves you a lot
of time in that process.

00:40:49.010 --> 00:40:52.850
You can also estimate, while you're
writing, if that's going to fit

00:40:52.850 --> 00:40:53.130
or not.

00:40:53.130 --> 00:40:54.450
So those time codes are imperative.

00:40:55.680 --> 00:41:01.810
The way that this works is we specify
the beginning and ending time code.

00:41:01.810 --> 00:41:06.650
And then we also tell the script,
the local Python Script that we run,

00:41:06.650 --> 00:41:11.020
basically, is this going to be an
extended audio description track,

00:41:11.020 --> 00:41:12.340
or a standard?

00:41:12.340 --> 00:41:16.830
And if it's extended,
it will pause the video and allow

00:41:16.830 --> 00:41:20.540
for the audio-narration
clip, whether that's human

00:41:20.540 --> 00:41:28.540
or synthetic to fit in and speak
that line while the video is frozen

00:41:29.730 --> 00:41:30.920
on screen.

00:41:30.920 --> 00:41:34.390
So that allows it to kind
of be a smoother process

00:41:34.390 --> 00:41:36.310
for someone viewing the video.

00:41:36.310 --> 00:41:39.940
And we also try to be mindful
of not freezing the video

00:41:39.940 --> 00:41:44.400
at a strange point, [chuckles],
again, for that smooth factor.

00:41:45.760 --> 00:41:49.740
A nice way to get timestamps
real quick, just to mention

00:41:51.900 --> 00:41:55.740
for anyone that's wondering,
How do I get a timestamp

00:41:55.740 --> 00:42:00.980
in a video? If you have VLC
media player, for example...

00:42:00.980 --> 00:42:03.010
That’s open-source
just like Audacity.

00:42:03.010 --> 00:42:06.910
You can download that on
Linux, Windows, Mac, et cetera.

00:42:06.910 --> 00:42:08.610
And it's a media player.

00:42:08.610 --> 00:42:12.060
It will play all sorts of
media files, which is handy.

00:42:12.060 --> 00:42:14.670
For example,
you can open an MP4 file

00:42:14.670 --> 00:42:19.960
and you can press the keyboard
shortcut list on Windows,

00:42:19.960 --> 00:42:24.960
Ctrl T, and it will
give you the go-to time.

00:42:26.880 --> 00:42:30.250
Yes, I think it's Ctrl
T, but I can verify that.

00:42:31.350 --> 00:42:34.110
It’s a keyboard shortcut that
will just give you an option

00:42:34.110 --> 00:42:37.260
to go anytime in the
video that you'd like to.

00:42:37.260 --> 00:42:42.700
But the default value is wherever
you happen to be in the video.

00:42:42.700 --> 00:42:46.570
So it will give you your current
timestamp, and that's very useful

00:42:46.570 --> 00:42:48.740
to write that into your script.

00:42:50.430 --> 00:42:54.960
We're looking into other options
as well, things like Subtitle Edit,

00:42:54.960 --> 00:43:00.650
which is a captioning tool that
allows you to add in time codes

00:43:00.650 --> 00:43:03.020
when you're preparing captions.

00:43:03.020 --> 00:43:06.180
And that would be kind of
nice to find a way to pair

00:43:06.180 --> 00:43:08.460
with the eventual GUI.

00:43:08.460 --> 00:43:11.570
So more on that later,
but there are many different ways

00:43:11.570 --> 00:43:12.740
to get time codes.

00:43:12.740 --> 00:43:18.260
You can do it with Windows Media
Player and other native, like,

00:43:18.260 --> 00:43:21.060
[Inaudible 00:43:18]

00:43:21.060 --> 00:43:24.260
on Windows, Mac, et cetera.

00:43:24.260 --> 00:43:29.710
And that's generally how you would
be able to track what your time is

00:43:29.710 --> 00:43:30.833
and how long you have.

00:43:38.990 --> 00:43:40.440
Mark, do you have anything to add?

00:43:40.440 --> 00:43:42.670
That was kind of it for me.

00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:44.780
 MARK: Yes,
we're almost out of time too.

00:43:44.780 --> 00:43:47.860
So that's a pretty good wrap up.

00:43:47.860 --> 00:43:50.950
So we are happy to help
anybody with any questions

00:43:50.950 --> 00:43:53.370
