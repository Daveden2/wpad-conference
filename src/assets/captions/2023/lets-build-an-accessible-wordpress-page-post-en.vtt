<v Amber Hinds> WordPress
Accessibility Day 2023.

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.310
Let's Build an Accessible WordPress
Page and Post with Speaker,

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:12.410
Peter Ingersoll, WordPress
Builder, Maintainer, and Trainer,

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:14.490
Ingersoll Interactive.

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.000
This presentation was
recorded September 27th, 2023.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.660
<v Laura Adamonis> Welcome back to
WordPress Accessibility Day 2023.

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:28.060
My name is Laura Adamonis and I'm a
Website Designer with my own agency.

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.850
I volunteer as a content
creator for the training team

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:33.390
at learn.wordpress.org.

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:39.890
I live in North Carolina and
I'm originally from Chicago.

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:43.220
I have a passion for
UX/UI and accessibility.

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.890
Today, thank you for
joining us for Let's Build

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.890
an Accessible WordPress Page
and Post with Peter Ingersoll.

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.330
Peter has been working on
the web since the beginning,

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:59.170
where he was lucky enough
to be part of a small group

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.560
to develop online access to
Connecticut's major newspapers.

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.710
While working in marketing
and communications,

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.190
he developed technical skills to
connect and share information pulled

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:12.840
from various data sources.

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.470
That led to a career creating
websites for other companies.

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.300
While initially working in cold
fusion to build his own CMS,

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.050
Peter discovered
WordPress at version 3.0.

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.050
Wow, and hasn't looked back.

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.740
Peter currently builds and maintains
sites for a variety of clients

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.030
with a focus on nonprofits.

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.750
He is the co-organizer and presenter
for the WordPress Hartford,

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.170
Connecticut Meetup Group,
which is an awesome group.

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.980
Peter considers himself an advocate
for DIY WordPress site admins,

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:46.700
and non-coders.

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.722
In recent years,
website accessibility has become

00:01:49.723 --> 00:01:53.910
an important part of Peter's
always developing skills.

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:57.620
You can often find Peter in
various WordPress Meetup Groups,

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:02.560
online discussions, and lurking
in several make WordPress teams.

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.510
With being from New England,
Peter's favorite food is steamers

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:10.550
and lobster with lots – and he
emphasized lots – of butter.

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.600
He is also a Big 80s music fan.

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.140
Any Tears for Fears or
Cars fans out there?

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.180
Welcome, Peter.

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.540
Oh, please feel free to add
your questions in the Zoom Q&A,

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.290
which you'll find at the bottom of
your toolbar and we'll answer them

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:28.860
at the end of the session.

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.910
Use the chat to connect
with other attendees.

00:02:33.367 --> 00:02:37.520
 PETER INGERSOLL: It's nice
having Laura introduce me

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:42.390
as we spend time in a variety
of meetups, online meetups

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:43.630
and groups and things like that.

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:47.190
So when Laura told me that
she was going to introduce me,

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.040
I was like, oh, a friendly face
and someone who will have my back

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.730
and make sure I'm keeping
time here and all.

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:56.100
So we're off to a good start.

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:01.400
I'm going to jump right into things
because we've got a lot to cover.

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:08.550
Like always, I bite off a big chunk
of this, but I thought it's very,

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:13.950
very important that there is a
practical approach to all this stuff.

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:15.936
I know there's a lot
of great presentations,

00:03:15.937 --> 00:03:17.040
fantastic presentations,

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.790
a lot of great demos,
but I always want to make sure

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:23.980
that people who are building
and managing their own sites,

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.940
aren't overwhelmed by things and
can figure out by just starting

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:33.450
at a certain level and pace and
want to pay attention to that.

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.480
Building an accessible
website doesn't have

00:03:36.481 --> 00:03:38.270
to be a big, scary thing.

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.950
It isn't.

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:42.470
It's really just a matter of
developing the right habits

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:44.610
when you know what
to pay attention to.

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:47.580
So that's what we're
going to do right now.

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:51.100
I'm going to be building
an accessible post.

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:57.150
I've prepared the content,
which is unusual for myself,

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.840
because a lot of times
I do things on the fly.

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.650
This time I try to do
things a little bit more

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.120
because the clock is a ticking.

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:09.840
But as we go,
I'll spend time on certain aspects

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.000
and then kind of bring
things in a done way

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.970
as we cover a few
different aspects of this.

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:19.680
So the first thing we're going
to do is I'm going to go right

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:24.710
into building an accessible
post demonstration.

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:28.150
Right now,
this is just a blank post.

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:29.150
I'm going to edit it.

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:38.130
And more also, you can tell me
if zooming into the screen helps,

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:39.960
I will have to probably
zoom in and out.

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:44.000
So I'm going to start
bringing in content right away

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:52.000
from my demo site here and I'm
going to bring it in such a way

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:59.640
that it's already formatted
and I'll walk through kind of

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:07.640
some of the things that are
already formatted and done.

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.110
I was going to do this as we go,
but I thought it would be better

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:12.480
just to kind of bring
these things in.

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:16.180
My slideshow is actually the
post that we're building.

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:22.380
So I thought, as we're building
this post, we could have content

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:26.400
that's specific to this particular
presentation and I'm going

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:30.450
to show you a few of the things
to pay attention to about this

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:32.150
and as we get into
some of the details.

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:36.180
So we went kind of an
introduction about creating a post

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:37.980
in a very short amount of time.

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:42.540
Laura did a great job of kind of
covering a little bit about me.

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:44.770
We are in the WordPress editor.

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:47.510
Right now I'm using
the block editor.

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:52.590
For this post,
I'm using only core blocks.

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:56.370
And when we get to the page,
I'm going to introduce some blocks

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:58.050
that are not core
from a block package.

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:00.700
We'll talk about
that in a little bit.

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:03.070
But one of the first things to
start noticing, and we'll get

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:08.520
into the detail about this,
is in the organizing of content,

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:12.780
a great thing to use is
looking at the outline mode.

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:16.950
It's great, but quite honestly,
there's some development I think

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:19.800
could be done to it because
it looks at headings only

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:20.840
from a core block thing.

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:24.320
So I'm going to point
out some of these blocks.

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:29.950
My introduction is an H2 heading
and it helps organize the content

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:34.210
so you can see the title of
this document of this post is,

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:36.310
Build an Accessible
Post Demonstration.

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:39.920
That's the title that I preset up
and I just brought in this content

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:43.440
where I have a heading set to H2.

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:47.420
So you see the H2 paragraph,
a little bit about me.

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:53.090
I mean introducing it and then a
subheading under the introduction,

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:53.990
a little bit about me.

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:55.980
So that's set to a heading of H3.

00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:59.290
So now we're starting to organize
right off the bat the content

00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:02.530
that goes into a blog post.

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:04.850
I've got links to content.

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:09.960
And one of the main things to look
at when you're putting links in,

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:17.960
is to avoid having links that
open into a new page or a new tab,

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:19.960
or a new window.

00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:22.770
People like to do that.

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:26.490
They want to make sure that readers
are always coming back to their site.

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:33.520
But for somebody who's using
assisted technology keyboards,

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:43.867
can't see the screen when they get
put into a different window or a tab.

00:07:43.867 --> 00:07:44.700
It's disruptive.

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:47.080
It's disruptive,
the process that they use.

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:52.350
And quite honestly, I like many,
I use the back key or I use...

00:07:52.350 --> 00:07:55.690
if I want to post something,
if I want to go to a link,

00:07:55.690 --> 00:07:57.730
I'll right click it and
say open in a new tab.

00:07:57.730 --> 00:07:58.790
I want control of it.

00:07:58.790 --> 00:08:03.940
I don’t necessarily want the
person who's defined the web page

00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:06.320
to define that.

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:10.030
We're going to get into some of
the details about what I'll cover.

00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:11.830
I'm going to bring that
content in right now.

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:17.790
Let me cover that.

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:25.590
Copying and pasting between different
documents is pretty straightforward.

00:08:25.590 --> 00:08:30.570
The easiest thing is to use
the list view, which shows...

00:08:30.570 --> 00:08:33.940
This list view has become
great for managing content.

00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:36.980
You can see the layout of
your paragraphs and image.

00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:41.360
I'm looking very forward
to, in 6.4.

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:45.120
I'm expecting to be able to
set groups and set the name

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:46.690
of the group right
here in those views

00:08:46.690 --> 00:08:50.000
so that you can really do a
great job of organizing content.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.220
I'm going to go to the
bottom of what I entered,

00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:57.000
and I'm just pasting in...
well, see I didn't copy it right,

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:57.890
so I'm going to undo that.

00:08:57.890 --> 00:08:59.930
I was facing the same content.

00:08:59.930 --> 00:09:01.050
Let me copy.

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:08.840
One of the tricks in copying
is not to do a Control V,

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:11.780
or a Control C,
but rather click the Copy button.

00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:12.570
I'll show you that.

00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:18.540
So what we will cover to
here, just to reveal,

00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:21.860
this is the content
I'm copying from.

00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:23.470
So you can see,
I've highlighted that.

00:09:23.470 --> 00:09:29.830
I'm going to copy this
content, copy the blocks.

00:09:29.830 --> 00:09:34.320
Then when I go back over to this
page, now I can paste those in.

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:36.390
So now I have more content.

00:09:36.390 --> 00:09:38.470
So what we'll cover is to
quickly create WordPress Post

00:09:38.470 --> 00:09:40.990
and Page Review and
accessibility topics.

00:09:40.990 --> 00:09:44.450
We'll get into detail... And by
the way, this site, as I post it,

00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:45.070
will be live.

00:09:45.070 --> 00:09:50.410
It's under accessiblewp.org and the
homepage will link to the content

00:09:50.410 --> 00:09:51.410
that we're editing.

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:57.470
Obviously, we can't get into
a huge amount of detail here

00:09:57.470 --> 00:09:59.520
with this presentation,
but there's a lot

00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:03.950
of great accessibility day
presentations that apply directly

00:10:03.950 --> 00:10:05.600
to some of the things
we're talking about.

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:08.320
And I highlighted
some of those here.

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:11.650
Each one of these being a link
that will open up on this page.

00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:14.580
You can see my link colors.

00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:16.160
My links are underlined.

00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:20.130
They're a different
color for the link.

00:10:20.130 --> 00:10:21.170
They're bright.

00:10:21.170 --> 00:10:23.270
I do have a hover color.

00:10:25.370 --> 00:10:27.984
These are reading
contrast requirements,

00:10:27.985 --> 00:10:30.800
which is something you want
to pay a lot of attention to.

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:32.400
We'll get a little
bit more into that.

00:10:34.130 --> 00:10:38.250
So let me go back and grab
a little bit more content.

00:10:38.250 --> 00:10:41.050
As we do this, I'm going to
move this out of the way,

00:10:44.130 --> 00:10:52.130
and now I'm going to
grab a next section here.

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:58.900
Sometimes it's easier
just to go to a section

00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:04.010
and even just add a
paragraph, for example.

00:11:04.010 --> 00:11:06.140
But in that paragraph,
then you can paste it.

00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:08.810
Little tricks that you use
sometimes when you get stuck

00:11:08.810 --> 00:11:13.230
in the block editor,
sometimes you just get muscle memory

00:11:13.230 --> 00:11:15.910
of doing things like entering
a paragraph and then posting it

00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:18.860
or hitting your slash to enter
a block, that type of thing.

00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:20.610
The assumptions, this is important.

00:11:20.610 --> 00:11:22.140
We are using accessible theme.

00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:23.930
I'm using the cadence theme.

00:11:23.930 --> 00:11:26.240
People who know me know that
I do like the cadence theme

00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:27.200
for a whole lot of reasons.

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:30.730
But in this particular case,
I selected the cadence theme

00:11:30.730 --> 00:11:38.560
because the cadence team, Ben Rittner
specifically as the head developer,

00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:43.670
they've been really paying
attention to accessibility.

00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:47.620
I've seen, and I've actually
put in some feature requests

00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:49.630
that I saw applied to the theme.

00:11:49.630 --> 00:11:51.680
So that's really,
really important to me,

00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:57.520
the fact that a theme developer is
paying attention to accessibility.

00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:00.090
So in the repository in
wordpress.org/themes,

00:12:01.150 --> 00:12:04.380
you can filter by accessibility.

00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:06.580
There is filtering
accessibility tags.

00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:09.980
But keep in mind that many
excellent accessible themes

00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:12.210
do not have this tag
for various reasons.

00:12:12.210 --> 00:12:16.970
One is they may have developed it
before the accessibility tag became

00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:21.080
as prevalent as it is now.

00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:25.800
And there's a process to go through
that not everybody has gone through,

00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:30.120
but it doesn't mean that the
themes are not accessible.

00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:32.240
It's a great starting
point, that filter.

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:37.960
But themes like cadence,
like generate press,

00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:41.290
Astra for the most part,
last I checked, block C.

00:12:41.290 --> 00:12:45.040
These are classic
themes, not block themes

00:12:45.041 --> 00:12:47.830
that they use the customizer...

00:12:47.830 --> 00:12:52.067
But they are very
friendly to accessibility,

00:12:52.067 --> 00:12:53.180
which is really important.

00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:56.740
But the main thing is like anything,
be sure to test your theme.

00:12:58.100 --> 00:13:01.480
We've already pre -selected
colors that work together,

00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:04.820
color contrast meets
accessibility guidelines.

00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:07.730
I believe there's a presentation
on that, but in any case,

00:13:07.730 --> 00:13:11.700
paying attention to the web
in contrast checker and a tool

00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:14.990
that I like, the color contrast
grid, maybe at the end,

00:13:14.990 --> 00:13:17.580
I can show some of the details
of this where you can look

00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:21.690
at the way colors work
together and what is compliant.

00:13:21.690 --> 00:13:25.500
I've only got a few active
plug-ins, even not all of them

00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:28.310
being used right now, like generate
blocks is active on this site

00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:31.540
because I'm using it for a
different page, for presentation.

00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:37.570
But the accessibility checker,
new windows warning, cadence blocks,

00:13:37.570 --> 00:13:41.500
all free versions, screen reader
text format, and WS form light are

00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:42.580
being used in this.

00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:46.510
So these are the types
of things that are here.

00:13:46.510 --> 00:13:49.500
Now, one of the things to pay
attention to is I've got images here.

00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:51.630
So let's talk about alt text.

00:13:51.630 --> 00:13:53.920
We'll talk about it in
a little bit detail now,

00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:57.380
but we've got some
pictures, some images here.

00:13:57.380 --> 00:14:01.350
So if I highlight the picture of
me, the caption

00:14:01.350 --> 00:14:09.080
and the alt text give
context to the image,

00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:11.560
but the alt text is meant to be...
to somebody

00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:14.490
who can't see the image, what is
the image of, describe the image,

00:14:14.490 --> 00:14:19.070
how do we make it the same experience
for that person as for anybody else?

00:14:19.070 --> 00:14:22.220
So a headshot of a 60 year
old white male with salt

00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:25.160
and pepper beard, and dark
hair, smiling at camera.

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:28.910
Well, that's me, but then my
name is the caption below.

00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:34.870
You'll see it in another section
of this, but this is not about SEO,

00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:38.410
Keyword stuffing or any
of that kind of stuff.

00:14:38.410 --> 00:14:44.250
It's all about making the
experience equal for everybody

00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:47.600
and includes somebody that can't
see the image but they want an idea

00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:49.950
of the fact that there's
a photo on the screen.

00:14:49.950 --> 00:14:55.140
Very, very important to pay
attention to those types of things.

00:14:55.140 --> 00:15:00.360
I'm going to add my
next group of blocks.

00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:12.220
Let me grab from here to...
This is where I do wish

00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:21.533
that sometimes the editor had
a little bit more description.

00:15:21.533 --> 00:15:24.370
When I said the
editor, the list view,

00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:29.190
because as I look over I'm bringing
over right now probably more

00:15:29.190 --> 00:15:33.700
than I want but that's OK,
we're just going to work right

00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:34.700
through the content.

00:15:35.590 --> 00:15:39.980
OK, so let's get into some of the
key considerations for accessibility.

00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:42.340
Many of these things we
can't go over in great detail

00:15:42.340 --> 00:15:44.600
but I'm posting this
kind of content...

00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:50.930
This is content that is brought
over in an ordered list.

00:15:50.930 --> 00:15:54.580
That's where we have the
numbers, so lists are again,

00:15:54.580 --> 00:15:57.370
they work really well in
WordPress for accessibility

00:15:57.370 --> 00:16:00.290
as far as any feedback that
I've gotten, when used properly

00:16:00.290 --> 00:16:03.520
and so in this case it's
just kind of a numbered list.

00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:09.030
A list is read out in screen
readers, it's organizing content

00:16:09.030 --> 00:16:12.510
so it's easy to scan,
very important to look at.

00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:17.340
We have different ways
of taking in content

00:16:17.340 --> 00:16:24.880
and different cognitive abilities,
neural divergence, all those...

00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:29.720
all the issues that can make
content easier or harder to take in.

00:16:31.630 --> 00:16:35.540
We can help with the
way we organize content.

00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:39.970
So these key topics of keyboard
navigation, content structure,

00:16:39.970 --> 00:16:43.870
alternative text for images,
the color contrast we talked briefly

00:16:43.870 --> 00:16:45.960
about is tied to the theme.

00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:48.790
Start with a good theme,
you're good to go for the most part,

00:16:48.790 --> 00:16:50.090
pay attention to the
colors as you go.

00:16:50.090 --> 00:16:53.220
Responsiveness, making sure
something works in mobile.

00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:59.730
Most people use a mobile device in
the world more than the desktop PC.

00:16:59.730 --> 00:17:04.250
So making sure that if your site's
going to work for everybody,

00:17:04.250 --> 00:17:06.830
then having it work on
mobile is so very important.

00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:10.370
Testing, always checking the site.

00:17:10.370 --> 00:17:12.670
These are all very
important kinds of things,

00:17:12.670 --> 00:17:16.100
there are people covering
topics of like automated testing

00:17:16.100 --> 00:17:17.510
versus paying attention to.

00:17:18.910 --> 00:17:22.840
So one of the key things
to really pay attention to

00:17:22.840 --> 00:17:25.940
and one of the first kind of
easiest things is, use your keyboard

00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:26.900
when looking at your site.

00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:28.520
So the importance of
keyboard navigation.

00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:30.500
Why is it so important?

00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:32.680
It's a mobility issue,
It's a screen reader.

00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:37.830
It's being able to help people work
through your content by tabbing

00:17:37.830 --> 00:17:44.080
through your content and you know
having your site work properly

00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:49.080
because you've organized it, because
you're using headings the right way

00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:51.040
and links the right way.

00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:54.510
You have a theme that isn't hiding
where the focus is of something.

00:17:54.510 --> 00:17:56.460
We'll take a look
at that in a second.

00:17:56.460 --> 00:17:57.610
I'll update it.

00:17:57.610 --> 00:17:59.390
We'll take a peek
at this page so far.

00:18:01.290 --> 00:18:03.650
I mentioned, though,
that heading outline

00:18:03.650 --> 00:18:06.050
as we're building this I'm using...
all of these again

00:18:06.050 --> 00:18:08.620
our core heading blocks, H3's.

00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:12.940
My topic of key consideration
for accessibility.

00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:14.030
It's an H2.

00:18:14.030 --> 00:18:18.320
You can see the outline on
the left building as we go,

00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:23.990
and that is the proper
nested use of headings.

00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:28.720
So your title H2 is treated
under H2’s, a new section.

00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:32.780
I always liken this to freshman
high school essay writing,

00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:34.980
and developing an outline
and things like that.

00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:37.660
There's a logic and an order
if you were to write an outline

00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:38.850
before the document.

00:18:38.850 --> 00:18:44.260
That's what you're looking at and
the proper way to use the heading.

00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:47.740
So really looking at those
and kind of keeping those

00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:52.020
in order are important because
it's all about making something...

00:18:52.020 --> 00:18:59.300
When you're using a site,
is everything reacting or working

00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:01.800
in an expected way?

00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:05.960
There's a logic to what you're
doing because when you have people

00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:08.200
who have different ways of
using your site the more

00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:11.380
you can apply a structure to
it, the more it makes sense

00:19:11.380 --> 00:19:15.390
and people know where they are
and what to expect as they go.

00:19:15.390 --> 00:19:18.340
So that proper ordering
is so important.

00:19:19.550 --> 00:19:23.550
The image in the alt text,
I'm going to grab the next couple

00:19:23.550 --> 00:19:25.970
of links here.

00:19:25.970 --> 00:19:30.900
I'm going to copy this
block from my source.

00:19:33.660 --> 00:19:35.520
Let me paste that.

00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:37.820
We kind of talked about that,
but this is something that kind

00:19:37.820 --> 00:19:42.250
of trips up people too,
is when I showed my picture,

00:19:42.250 --> 00:19:46.080
I had it, but the differences
between images and alt text.

00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:49.180
Alt text is used to describe
what image looks like.

00:19:49.180 --> 00:19:52.720
There's better, longer ways of
doing it, but the alt text describes

00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:54.870
what the image looks like,

00:19:54.871 --> 00:19:58.840
whereas the caption might
give you the context

00:19:58.840 --> 00:19:59.960
for what something is.

00:20:01.750 --> 00:20:04.990
Some key things to
pay attention to is,

00:20:04.990 --> 00:20:10.460
as someone's using a screen reader,
a lot of this content is coming

00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:11.340
at them.

00:20:11.340 --> 00:20:16.720
So being efficient and not
verbose is kind of important

00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:20.080
and also not giving
description or alt text

00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:22.180
for things like decorative text.

00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:25.330
That's important because again,
now if you've got lots of icons

00:20:25.330 --> 00:20:28.840
and its describing what each icon
is, as opposed to

00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:32.830
maybe what that icon links
to, that's different content.

00:20:32.830 --> 00:20:37.880
But, in the demonstrations
that I see, and many done

00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:41.870
by our good friend Alex Stein
when he goes through things

00:20:41.870 --> 00:20:46.580
and when he sees icons, he goes,
don't put alt text on icons

00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:50.150
because it slows down the process
of going through the content.

00:20:50.150 --> 00:20:54.390
So in this image, my alt
text, I've got a description,

00:20:54.390 --> 00:20:57.300
which is the caption,
but the blind woman

00:20:57.300 --> 00:21:00.420
at the computer using assistive
technology, might be good...

00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:03.310
we can get a little bit more
verbose, but not too much.

00:21:05.630 --> 00:21:09.230
I can get descriptions,
I might be wearing a green sweater

00:21:09.230 --> 00:21:12.333
and sitting at a desk...
a green colored desk,

00:21:12.334 --> 00:21:14.050
something to that effect.

00:21:14.050 --> 00:21:20.410
The icon here, I've got no alt text
and WordPress is done in my testing.

00:21:20.410 --> 00:21:27.790
It does a good job of giving the null
value for when there is no alt text.

00:21:27.790 --> 00:21:31.650
So basically in a screen
reader, that skipped over,

00:21:31.650 --> 00:21:37.610
which is different than
having no alt text in there.

00:21:37.610 --> 00:21:40.960
You need that alt tag,
WordPress puts it in for us,

00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:46.440
but specifically for decorative,
we don't need the alt text.

00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:49.500
And then things like when you
have a graphic that has words

00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:52.600
in it,
you want to include those words

00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:55.740
in your alt text
because, we're looking

00:21:55.740 --> 00:21:59.080
at it, we're reading the words
in an image, so reading the words

00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:02.610
in the alt text, if you can't see
the image is very, very important.

00:22:02.610 --> 00:22:05.260
So far, let's take a
look at what we've got.

00:22:05.260 --> 00:22:11.540
I'm going to view this post,
and here's what we built so far.

00:22:11.540 --> 00:22:14.100
And yes, I shortcut a lot of
the process because I have to

00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:15.580
in the amount of time given.

00:22:15.580 --> 00:22:18.840
But one of the first things is
I'm going to hit my Tab key.

00:22:19.940 --> 00:22:25.090
And when I look at the Tab key...
Well, the one problem is

00:22:26.530 --> 00:22:31.150
when you're in the admin, and a
trick is I often open the sites

00:22:31.150 --> 00:22:34.870
in a new Incognito window.

00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:38.820
Open that here.

00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:43.680
And now when I tab through,
you can see my first link is a skip

00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:45.840
to content if I already
know the navigation.

00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:47.410
Then my focus is clear to me.

00:22:47.410 --> 00:22:50.140
It's outlined going
through each link.

00:22:50.140 --> 00:22:51.470
It's outlining it.

00:22:51.470 --> 00:22:53.940
A lot of times you might
work with somebody who says,

00:22:53.940 --> 00:22:55.230
I don't like the way that looks.

00:22:55.230 --> 00:22:58.880
Well, the focus is not for
you to like the way it looks,

00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:01.630
it's to help everybody
be able to use the site.

00:23:01.630 --> 00:23:04.670
And for people who are using a
keyboard to know where they are,

00:23:04.670 --> 00:23:06.120
it's very, very important.

00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:11.760
The Drop-down is a good example
of what cadence has done,

00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:14.970
where they've made the
drop-down work nicely,

00:23:14.970 --> 00:23:18.530
where you can specifically
go through the drop-down,

00:23:18.530 --> 00:23:20.920
escape out of it,
not all themes do that.

00:23:21.950 --> 00:23:23.250
Continue from there.

00:23:23.250 --> 00:23:28.050
Now when I get into the content,
you can see where the focus is,

00:23:28.050 --> 00:23:30.260
my links as I'm highlighting.

00:23:31.820 --> 00:23:36.990
So this is reacting with a
keyboard the way we want it to.

00:23:36.990 --> 00:23:42.030
I also do a quick test,
for example, in using Wave,

00:23:42.030 --> 00:23:44.470
which is telling me right
now we've got zero errors,

00:23:44.470 --> 00:23:49.920
zero contrast errors, some
alerts to pay attention to, Wave,

00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:52.710
you can go to the
website itself for Wave.

00:23:52.710 --> 00:23:56.470
I'm using a Chrome extension
and get some details

00:23:56.470 --> 00:24:00.990
on what some of these alerts are
and what to pay attention to.

00:24:02.870 --> 00:24:04.970
These make sense without
going into the details of it,

00:24:04.970 --> 00:24:08.460
but the possible heading it's
looking at, my heading information

00:24:08.460 --> 00:24:10.060
and the title of the site and
going, wait a minute,

00:24:10.060 --> 00:24:13.420
is that the heading of the
site as opposed to the heading

00:24:13.420 --> 00:24:16.670
of the content, versus the main H1?

00:24:16.670 --> 00:24:18.660
You can see my links here.

00:24:18.660 --> 00:24:22.730
I mean,
my headings clearly organized.

00:24:22.730 --> 00:24:27.060
You can look at the structure
here and have that make sense.

00:24:27.060 --> 00:24:30.600
So all of these things as you're
building the page and checking

00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:32.850
on it and going, OK, are things
in the right order, are things

00:24:32.850 --> 00:24:33.850
as expected?

00:24:35.210 --> 00:24:41.650
Another thing that's kind of nice
about another Chrome extension

00:24:41.650 --> 00:24:43.360
called Tably.

00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:48.450
And when you click on that, what it
does is it goes through your site

00:24:48.450 --> 00:24:54.430
and it's going to tell you
where, as you're tabbing through.

00:24:54.430 --> 00:24:55.290
So you get an idea.

00:24:55.290 --> 00:24:57.640
Now, if this is going in a
logical order, you can see it.

00:24:57.640 --> 00:24:58.950
We just tab through.

00:24:58.950 --> 00:25:01.360
I mean, one of the best
things is just do it yourself.

00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:03.400
But tools like this do
help you kind of see

00:25:04.780 --> 00:25:09.000
how your site is logically organized,
which is very, very important

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:10.000
for accessibility.

00:25:11.020 --> 00:25:14.180
Coming back to the
content, I've got little...

00:25:16.570 --> 00:25:19.990
I do have another active plug-in
that kind of hides that admin bar.

00:25:19.990 --> 00:25:24.030
So when I'm doing demonstrations,
it just kind of gets out of the way.

00:25:24.030 --> 00:25:30.930
I'm going to bring in my
last bit here of content.

00:25:38.140 --> 00:25:40.750
I don't think you can hear, but my
cat is outside the door screaming.

00:25:45.890 --> 00:25:51.360
So, the one thing, and we'll come
back to this, but if you start

00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:52.842
with a good foundation
for accessibility,

00:25:52.843 --> 00:25:53.760
including themes, colors,

00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:57.780
and fonts, creating system accessible
content is not too difficult,

00:25:57.780 --> 00:25:59.500
it just becomes a new habit.

00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:02.210
So now let's take
it one step further.

00:26:02.210 --> 00:26:05.200
So I'm going to go here,
I'm going to view this post.

00:26:06.830 --> 00:26:10.490
And while I'm calling this up,
have there been any questions

00:26:10.490 --> 00:26:13.800
that we can handle so
far, I'm just kind of...

00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:17.940
I'll show you two more things while
I do this that I forgot to do,

00:26:17.940 --> 00:26:22.030
which is going back to the post.

00:26:22.030 --> 00:26:29.650
I'm going to make sure that
the categories here make sense,

00:26:29.650 --> 00:26:32.920
which is accessibility
and presentation.

00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:35.710
And I am going to
set a featured image.

00:26:35.710 --> 00:26:43.480
I think we'll go with this one
and we do have alt text preset.

00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:46.045
You could do that when
you're uploading images

00:26:46.046 --> 00:26:47.300
to your image library.

00:26:47.300 --> 00:26:48.650
You could always change them.

00:26:50.130 --> 00:26:53.070
And once I have that,
we'll update this.

00:26:54.500 --> 00:27:00.570
Now we've added it, defined by the
theme how that image is coming in,

00:27:00.570 --> 00:27:04.730
I think how these additional links
and what details that they go to.

00:27:04.730 --> 00:27:09.720
So let's go here and now I'm going
to go to keep an eye on the time.

00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:11.970
OK, we're going to do this
pretty quickly, obviously.

00:27:13.690 --> 00:27:15.630
I'm going to build a page.

00:27:15.630 --> 00:27:19.140
Now you think that'd be bigger,
but to we're going to show elements

00:27:19.140 --> 00:27:26.260
and now I'm going to start
introducing some custom blocks.

00:27:26.260 --> 00:27:30.650
Not custome blocks, some block
packages, specifically in this case,

00:27:30.650 --> 00:27:31.790
cadence blocks.

00:27:31.790 --> 00:27:33.440
These are the free ones.

00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:38.510
Again, there's so many good block
packages, but the real trick would be

00:27:38.510 --> 00:27:41.030
how do they handle accessibility?

00:27:41.030 --> 00:27:44.404
I like cadence because it
gives me additional controls

00:27:44.405 --> 00:27:45.570
for accessibility.

00:27:45.570 --> 00:27:50.290
It gives me the ability to do
proper titling and use aria text

00:27:50.290 --> 00:27:50.970
and things like that.

00:27:50.970 --> 00:27:53.950
Things we're not going
to get into right now.

00:27:53.950 --> 00:27:58.250
And one other thing, I'm going to
go back here, because I did want

00:27:58.250 --> 00:28:04.930
to make sure that we're highlighting
on the posts, what I just did.

00:28:06.990 --> 00:28:09.730
Because I didn't show this
yet but as we were going,

00:28:09.730 --> 00:28:16.300
I do have the accessibility checker
plug-in loaded, which is great,

00:28:16.300 --> 00:28:20.130
a high-rise digital with Amber,
this is their team's tool.

00:28:20.130 --> 00:28:23.120
And it really is an excellent
tool that's showing me

00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:26.600
as I go the kind of content
that we're dealing with.

00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:28.070
One of the things when
I first – and I think

00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:34.390
this is an important note – put this
together is the reading level...

00:28:34.390 --> 00:28:37.190
because a lot of the
content in my first pass

00:28:37.190 --> 00:28:41.060
at this was ChatGPT
written and I didn't tell

00:28:41.060 --> 00:28:43.060
what reading level it came in.

00:28:43.060 --> 00:28:45.670
It came in above a 12th
grade reading level,

00:28:45.670 --> 00:28:52.300
which also required a summary level
and something to make it simpler.

00:28:52.300 --> 00:28:52.830
That's not good.

00:28:52.830 --> 00:28:54.610
Again, it's not good for anybody.

00:28:55.860 --> 00:28:59.320
The great thing about accessibility
is, it's good for everybody

00:28:59.320 --> 00:29:00.920
when you're really
paying attention to it.

00:29:00.920 --> 00:29:03.560
So being reminded as you're
going through, you know,

00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:05.350
do I have any contrast errors?

00:29:05.350 --> 00:29:09.080
Do I have any other specific
errors as we're going through?

00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:12.080
This is actually showing the same
errors that the Wave tool showed.

00:29:13.570 --> 00:29:19.123
And then, am I staying on
track on the reading level?

00:29:19.124 --> 00:29:21.180
All fantastic tools.

00:29:21.180 --> 00:29:23.640
Then if I were to look
at this on the front-end,

00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:29.050
I love this new ability to turn
on the accessibility checker

00:29:29.050 --> 00:29:33.480
on the front-end, and then look
to see some of those aspects

00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:39.530
when you get into the specific
issues to pay attention to.

00:29:39.530 --> 00:29:41.520
It walks you through the
things to really look at.

00:29:43.220 --> 00:29:46.010
So again, you have to look at
yourself, even though you go

00:29:46.010 --> 00:29:46.550
through the tool.

00:29:46.550 --> 00:29:49.790
So I just want to make sure
we cover that really quickly.

00:29:49.790 --> 00:29:52.430
All right, so building the
page, the first thing I'm going

00:29:52.430 --> 00:29:59.890
to do is I'm going to
bring over a hero element.

00:29:59.890 --> 00:30:04.420
Now, this hero element is made
up of... and you'll see a lot

00:30:04.420 --> 00:30:11.960
of these things are cadence
blocks, including cadence headings.

00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:18.080
I wanted to demonstrate this because
while the Outliner works great,

00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:24.150
what it doesn't do, is it
doesn't see headings from blocks

00:30:24.150 --> 00:30:28.940
that are not core heading blocks,
even though they use the H2, H3,

00:30:28.940 --> 00:30:36.940
H4 heading... just describes the CSS
element that says this is a heading.

00:30:40.430 --> 00:30:43.890
I hope that that happens because
the problem is when you look at it,

00:30:43.890 --> 00:30:48.590
even though this is set as an
H2, this is set not as a heading.

00:30:48.590 --> 00:30:52.500
This is again, one of the
reasons why I like in cadence,

00:30:52.500 --> 00:31:00.220
you have something called the
text advance, which allows you

00:31:00.220 --> 00:31:04.200
to set up the heading if you want
to do things in the right order.

00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:07.740
But it also allows you to use all
the features, but you're going

00:31:07.740 --> 00:31:10.730
to set this as a div,
and then you're going to control all

00:31:10.730 --> 00:31:12.590
of the colors and things like
that, which makes

00:31:12.590 --> 00:31:16.760
some of these more advanced
block packages work.

00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:20.430
Without saying, I want it to
look like a certain... I want it

00:31:20.430 --> 00:31:22.650
to be larger here, so I'm
going to make it a heading two,

00:31:22.650 --> 00:31:25.270
even though that doesn't make sense
in the order, and that is a trap

00:31:25.270 --> 00:31:27.190
that many people fall into.

00:31:27.190 --> 00:31:30.170
You drop in something,
I want this bigger so I'm going

00:31:30.170 --> 00:31:32.450
to increase the heading size.

00:31:32.450 --> 00:31:40.629
The heading numbers, H2, H3,
H4, are not for just formatting.

00:31:40.630 --> 00:31:42.686
Obviously,
there's a formatting element,

00:31:42.687 --> 00:31:44.190
but to say I want large text,

00:31:44.190 --> 00:31:48.870
so I'm going to use an H2 in an
area where an H2 shouldn't be used,

00:31:48.870 --> 00:31:50.350
you kind of need to
pay attention to that.

00:31:51.670 --> 00:31:55.698
So right now,
my outline on the front-end anyway,

00:31:55.699 --> 00:31:57.950
and on the back-end,
isn't showing.

00:31:57.950 --> 00:32:00.870
I'm going to go to the front-end,
we'll clearly be able to see

00:32:02.550 --> 00:32:04.190
how those headings are.

00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:09.500
They have what's called a
button, but there's a whole...

00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:13.470
pay attention to what is a
button versus what is a link.

00:32:13.470 --> 00:32:17.170
And a button is something that
is meant to make an action

00:32:17.170 --> 00:32:20.810
on the page, submitting a
form and we'll have that

00:32:20.810 --> 00:32:23.660
in a little bit,
versus linking to something else.

00:32:23.660 --> 00:32:29.050
You can make a link look like a
button, but it isn't marked up

00:32:29.050 --> 00:32:34.350
in HTML as a button because
that has a certain implication

00:32:34.350 --> 00:32:37.520
through things like screen readers
that we don't want to have happen.

00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:40.880
In this particular case,
this is really just a link.

00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:45.860
I can show what the link is,
even though it's formatted a button.

00:32:45.860 --> 00:32:48.270
Another option is
what I very often use;

00:32:49.740 --> 00:32:56.010
the headline... sorry the
advanced text, which kind of falls

00:32:56.010 --> 00:32:59.280
into the headline category, but
using a div and then formatting it

00:32:59.280 --> 00:33:02.070
to maybe look like a button
if that's what I want.

00:33:02.070 --> 00:33:10.070
On the back of this, is a row,
and the row has a background image,

00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:18.760
but it also has a white overlay set
to a certain percentage of opacity.

00:33:20.730 --> 00:33:24.010
This is 100% opaque, this is lower.

00:33:24.010 --> 00:33:29.220
You want to pay attention to
these based on, does it make sense

00:33:29.220 --> 00:33:32.590
to the images there and are we
still having enough contrast

00:33:32.590 --> 00:33:38.030
between the lettering that we have
here, and the image behind it?

00:33:38.030 --> 00:33:42.760
And then in fact, you could even put
background color behind certain texts

00:33:42.760 --> 00:33:44.550
to even further call that out.

00:33:44.550 --> 00:33:51.060
So if you have a dark
background with lighter text,

00:33:51.060 --> 00:33:52.570
but maybe there's
some lighter areas,

00:33:52.570 --> 00:33:55.310
maybe putting a shadow behind
the text, there's different ways

00:33:55.310 --> 00:33:58.470
to increase that contrast,
but just making sure

00:33:58.470 --> 00:34:02.060
that you are paying attention to
that color contrast and another,

00:34:02.060 --> 00:34:04.930
a little tip is to make sure
that the background color,

00:34:04.930 --> 00:34:06.610
because while you have
a background image,

00:34:06.610 --> 00:34:08.850
you can also have background
color that you're setting

00:34:08.850 --> 00:34:12.610
is also the same light
color if you have dark text

00:34:12.610 --> 00:34:18.700
or vice versa, because often the
tools are reading not the image,

00:34:18.700 --> 00:34:20.690
but the background color.

00:34:20.690 --> 00:34:23.470
And that's important because
somebody may even not even

00:34:23.470 --> 00:34:25.180
be showing the images.

00:34:25.180 --> 00:34:27.710
And you want to know what that
background color looks like,

00:34:27.710 --> 00:34:32.140
even though you have
a background image.

00:34:32.140 --> 00:34:40.140
Going back to my content here,
I'm going to bring out a few more.

00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:55.340
So I've attempted to hit Control
C and it doesn't always work

00:34:55.340 --> 00:34:56.890
for what we want it to.

00:34:58.370 --> 00:35:01.260
Copy the blocks,
I'm going to bring to here.

00:35:02.480 --> 00:35:03.260
Let me bring the checker.

00:35:03.260 --> 00:35:06.150
The checker so far is telling
me that I'm in good shape.

00:35:08.130 --> 00:35:10.160
Paste the additional
blocks that we've got here.

00:35:11.350 --> 00:35:16.000
Here is a heading text set to H2.

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:17.780
Now I'm organizing it.

00:35:17.780 --> 00:35:23.590
Again, this is using the cadence
blocks just to show again,

00:35:23.590 --> 00:35:28.500
it doesn't necessarily
show up in the outline.

00:35:28.500 --> 00:35:34.010
However, you can see that this
the next area down areas of focus,

00:35:34.010 --> 00:35:38.770
I did set that as a core heading
and now we can see it shows up here.

00:35:38.770 --> 00:35:41.013
That's just something to
pay attention to of what is,

00:35:41.014 --> 00:35:41.760
or isn't there.

00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:43.330
So don't rely on that completely.

00:35:44.850 --> 00:35:48.070
One thing to think about too
in terms of accessibility is

00:35:48.070 --> 00:35:51.250
when you center something
versus left, justify something,

00:35:51.250 --> 00:35:54.690
think about reading skills
levels, the width that you have.

00:35:54.690 --> 00:35:57.414
Try to keep things a little
bit thinner, larger text

00:35:57.415 --> 00:35:58.390
in a smaller area.

00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:05.680
For folks who have a little bit
trouble with reading, scanning,

00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:09.040
dyslexia, there's a lot of ways
you can help people with that

00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:11.650
by the way you organize this.

00:36:11.650 --> 00:36:14.620
But again, the benefit is you're
making your content easier

00:36:14.621 --> 00:36:15.610
for everybody.

00:36:15.610 --> 00:36:17.890
Easier to scan, easier to
read, easier to go through.

00:36:19.340 --> 00:36:21.887
Here's a classic area
where the people have kind

00:36:21.888 --> 00:36:24.804
of the three sections
and images and links to

00:36:24.805 --> 00:36:27.720
and often this is where
you might find a link

00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:28.640
being a button.

00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:29.510
These are not buttons.

00:36:29.510 --> 00:36:30.780
These are text links.

00:36:32.490 --> 00:36:38.450
They can have, and right now this
does use a cadence, the heading

00:36:38.450 --> 00:36:43.420
that same heading so I can have
the advanced text actually is.

00:36:43.420 --> 00:36:44.780
I can put an icon with it.

00:36:44.780 --> 00:36:50.780
It's built into this particular
block, in this block package.

00:36:50.780 --> 00:36:54.840
I am keeping the text left justified
just because again it's easier.

00:36:54.840 --> 00:36:59.310
Some cases the wall center you can
see at the top I centered that area.

00:36:59.310 --> 00:37:03.820
But as I build this content out,
I've got things that make sense

00:37:03.820 --> 00:37:04.850
where they are.

00:37:04.850 --> 00:37:07.950
I have alt text for
these images here.

00:37:07.950 --> 00:37:11.240
In this particular case,
I am only linking at the bottom.

00:37:11.240 --> 00:37:16.250
In some cases, you can link
from the title and so on.

00:37:16.250 --> 00:37:18.190
But also keep in mind,
if you're a screen reader,

00:37:18.190 --> 00:37:20.500
and you make everything a
link, link, link.

00:37:20.500 --> 00:37:23.400
It's going to read all of
them, read out the same ones.

00:37:23.400 --> 00:37:25.590
In a lot of cases,
what you're trying to say is,

00:37:26.650 --> 00:37:29.420
let me present you a section and
then if you want to go to it,

00:37:29.420 --> 00:37:31.550
let me present you and go to it.

00:37:31.550 --> 00:37:35.750
So you're not inundating
users with links.

00:37:37.100 --> 00:37:43.170
So again, something to be aware
of, and I'd rather have you make

00:37:43.170 --> 00:37:46.010
a conscious decision that you
do or don't do something than

00:37:46.010 --> 00:37:48.680
to just say, well,
we always do it that way.

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:53.350
So let me get out of that.

00:37:53.350 --> 00:37:54.650
I'm going to update this.

00:37:56.020 --> 00:37:57.420
Let's take a look at our score.

00:38:02.030 --> 00:38:06.950
And look, we're doing great,
I've got seven warnings here.

00:38:06.950 --> 00:38:11.400
I'm at a 12th grade reading level,
I'm not sure why that's the case.

00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:14.810
We'll have to take a look
at what I've got in here

00:38:14.810 --> 00:38:16.260
that might look at that.

00:38:17.590 --> 00:38:20.660
I didn't think in my demo I had
that, but that's OK.

00:38:20.660 --> 00:38:22.650
We're working through this.

00:38:22.650 --> 00:38:23.360
Let's continue.

00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:28.820
So let me bring over the rest
of the content so I can walk

00:38:28.820 --> 00:38:31.100
through these sections.

00:38:35.890 --> 00:38:39.520
Another trick too, if you're
not exactly sure the best way

00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:41.820
and you want to say, OK,
I'm on this row and now I want

00:38:41.820 --> 00:38:45.650
to add after,
the add before add after another way

00:38:45.650 --> 00:38:49.430
that you can kind of quickly
put content where you want.

00:38:49.430 --> 00:38:52.260
Let me paste everything
that we've got here.

00:38:52.260 --> 00:38:54.710
Did I paste the same content?

00:38:54.710 --> 00:38:55.710
I did.

00:38:56.730 --> 00:38:59.500
Because I hit Control C again.

00:39:00.600 --> 00:39:03.050
Copy box, there we go.

00:39:04.940 --> 00:39:10.850
OK, so again, if you're building
out a page, in this case,

00:39:10.850 --> 00:39:12.150
I've got more text.

00:39:12.150 --> 00:39:14.610
I'm making it narrow,
making it easier.

00:39:16.080 --> 00:39:20.650
Here's where I've got a... that's
my reminder to wrap it up here.

00:39:20.650 --> 00:39:25.190
Here's where I've got another
section with some decorative images.

00:39:25.190 --> 00:39:29.160
These images, I don't have any
alt text, because I don't want

00:39:29.160 --> 00:39:33.840
to describe swirly breaking
orange and blue image.

00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:37.710
It adds no value to
somebody, but this is an H2

00:39:37.710 --> 00:39:39.430
because it's a section I've got.

00:39:39.430 --> 00:39:42.840
This is a form that I've created
using, in this particular case,

00:39:42.840 --> 00:39:45.730
the WS form light, form plug-in.

00:39:45.730 --> 00:39:49.100
There are a lot of great
form plug-ins, gravity forms,

00:39:49.100 --> 00:39:53.560
fluent forms I use that have paid a
lot of attention to accessibility.

00:39:53.560 --> 00:39:55.700
They give you clues
as you're building.

00:39:55.700 --> 00:39:59.510
WordPress is giving you clues as
you're building, this color on top

00:39:59.510 --> 00:40:01.600
of that color,
that probably doesn't work.

00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:06.060
So having those clues come
through fantastic, excellent tool.

00:40:06.060 --> 00:40:08.360
So again, starting with
some of the right things.

00:40:08.360 --> 00:40:14.030
In this case, the WS form
plug-in using the light version

00:40:14.030 --> 00:40:16.410
out of the repository that's free.

00:40:16.410 --> 00:40:18.926
It's worth going for
the paid version,

00:40:18.927 --> 00:40:20.990
but we're going all free today.

00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:25.204
And in the form, making sure

00:40:25.205 --> 00:40:28.890
that you've got your
labels properly posted.

00:40:28.890 --> 00:40:31.240
You're not just relying
on a placeholder.

00:40:32.700 --> 00:40:35.470
You can focus on
each piece of content

00:40:35.470 --> 00:40:40.770
and clearly help somebody
know that I'm on a form,

00:40:40.770 --> 00:40:43.530
here's a field to fill
out the field is named.

00:40:43.530 --> 00:40:47.610
A lot of times when you are testing
a site and you go through one

00:40:47.610 --> 00:40:52.130
of the testing tools,
you’ll find that forms are notorious

00:40:52.130 --> 00:40:55.600
for throwing errors, but it's because
when folks are designing them,

00:40:55.600 --> 00:40:57.280
they're designing them
for a certain aesthetic

00:40:57.280 --> 00:41:01.410
without necessarily designing
them for functionality.

00:41:01.410 --> 00:41:03.190
And that's kind of a key
thing that we're looking at

00:41:03.190 --> 00:41:06.460
when we're talking about building
something with an accessibility.

00:41:06.460 --> 00:41:10.120
I'm also moving a
little bit further down.

00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:14.480
I'm using the social icon
block, core block.

00:41:14.480 --> 00:41:17.730
I put the icon blocks in here.

00:41:20.360 --> 00:41:24.680
One thing I do want to show you
is, if I have a block

00:41:24.680 --> 00:41:29.160
of text here, and at one
point I had a number of texts,

00:41:29.160 --> 00:41:34.190
but I just want to show you this
text here, there's a great plug-in,

00:41:34.190 --> 00:41:37.470
which I shared in the other post.

00:41:37.470 --> 00:41:40.980
I have to remember the exact
title, but basically it allows you

00:41:40.980 --> 00:41:42.820
to hide text from a screen reader.

00:41:42.820 --> 00:41:47.300
Let me go up here, like say,
I didn't want to show this piece

00:41:47.300 --> 00:41:50.578
of information to
somebody who's reading it,

00:41:50.579 --> 00:41:52.690
but it might make more sense

00:41:52.690 --> 00:41:54.890
in a screen reader,
maybe a little bit of extra detail.

00:41:54.890 --> 00:41:58.540
For example, I might say, hey,
there's a lot of links here

00:41:58.540 --> 00:41:59.730
just to be aware.

00:41:59.730 --> 00:42:01.810
Somebody who could see it could
see there's a lot of links,

00:42:01.810 --> 00:42:03.510
but maybe you want to share that.

00:42:03.510 --> 00:42:06.690
There is that when you
install this plug-in,

00:42:06.690 --> 00:42:08.430
you do get a screen reader only.

00:42:08.430 --> 00:42:11.030
It's like formatting it just like
you would go through any of these,

00:42:11.030 --> 00:42:12.730
where you highlight it, whatever.

00:42:12.730 --> 00:42:15.440
But now you're saying,
make this screen reader only,

00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:21.740
and it becomes invisible to people
who are just reading the screen

00:42:21.740 --> 00:42:25.610
as opposed to using a screen
reader, actually visually looking

00:42:25.610 --> 00:42:26.830
at that screen.

00:42:26.830 --> 00:42:28.940
So That's a neat little
plug-in for when you want

00:42:28.940 --> 00:42:31.470
to have more information,
again, to make it helpful

00:42:31.470 --> 00:42:34.150
as somebody is going
through screen reading.

00:42:35.630 --> 00:42:43.630
The thing about the social media text
block is you can show the labels.

00:42:44.610 --> 00:42:52.520
In this particular case, the labels
are a bit much for design-wise.

00:42:52.520 --> 00:42:56.880
Also, we do run into a
little bit of contrast issues

00:42:56.880 --> 00:42:59.880
with these two colors here, the
light blue and white, the light green

00:42:59.880 --> 00:43:00.850
and white.

00:43:00.850 --> 00:43:04.670
But what I'm also showing you
is that that the text associated

00:43:04.670 --> 00:43:06.980
with it does get read
out in a screen reader,

00:43:06.980 --> 00:43:11.370
which makes this again useful,
because now it says, the link is

00:43:11.370 --> 00:43:16.150
to Peter Ingersoll on WordPress.org,
Peter Ingersoll on Facebook.

00:43:16.150 --> 00:43:20.840
So instead of just being a link, it
does read out where you're going to.

00:43:20.840 --> 00:43:24.530
So again, tools that make
everything very, very useful.

00:43:24.530 --> 00:43:27.820
We're doing great on
the accessibility tool.

00:43:29.650 --> 00:43:30.700
Let me view the page.

00:43:32.940 --> 00:43:35.940
This is what we built
or pulled together.

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:39.260
And then again,
if I were to take a look at this

00:43:39.260 --> 00:43:46.370
in an incognito window and
run some wave against it,

00:43:47.400 --> 00:43:51.740
as one of the tools...
I am getting zero errors.

00:43:51.740 --> 00:43:53.250
I'm going to see,
going through this tool,

00:43:53.250 --> 00:43:57.230
that I do have contrast errors
and it's what I expected.

00:43:57.230 --> 00:44:02.740
These are my two links down here.

00:44:02.740 --> 00:44:06.330
It's often easier, by the
way, if you turn off styles,

00:44:06.330 --> 00:44:07.830
which also gives you an idea
of, again,

00:44:07.831 --> 00:44:09.030
what a screen reader is reading

00:44:09.030 --> 00:44:17.030
and this is where it's showing
the very specific contrast errors.

00:44:17.740 --> 00:44:21.300
But that is a lightning round
of putting together two sites

00:44:21.300 --> 00:44:24.750
without going through creating
each and every block as we did.

00:44:26.470 --> 00:44:31.370
And I think we're
set at this point.

00:44:31.370 --> 00:44:32.990
 <v Laura> Thank you, Peter.

00:44:33.700 --> 00:44:34.212
<v Peter> Hey, I came in

00:44:34.213 --> 00:44:35.900
 <v Laura> That was awesome.

00:44:35.900 --> 00:44:41.010
And please, if you have any other
questions, put them in the Q&A.

00:44:41.010 --> 00:44:43.360
We'll start our Q&A segment.

00:44:43.360 --> 00:44:45.070
 <v Peter> Fanatastic.

00:44:47.300 --> 00:44:48.150
 <v Laura> All right.

00:44:48.150 --> 00:44:49.950
I actually had one
at the beginning.

00:44:49.950 --> 00:44:57.950
So I noticed that at the beginning,
when you showed the headings

00:44:58.440 --> 00:45:04.430
and stuff in that view,
there was the title, and then the H2.

00:45:04.430 --> 00:45:06.730
What is the difference
between using a title

00:45:06.730 --> 00:45:09.890
as opposed to putting in an H1?

00:45:09.890 --> 00:45:10.690
 <v Peter> Right.

00:45:10.690 --> 00:45:17.720
So depending on factors, depending
on primarily the theme, right?

00:45:17.720 --> 00:45:22.510
So the theme is where you're kind of
deciding what code gets put there.

00:45:22.510 --> 00:45:28.460
What I found is most of the
themes that I pay attention to,

00:45:28.460 --> 00:45:31.460
there's how many tens
of thousands of themes?

00:45:31.460 --> 00:45:39.460
And I pay attention to just six,
uses the page title as the H1.

00:45:41.970 --> 00:45:46.190
And when you think about it,
it's like everything is bound

00:45:46.190 --> 00:45:48.400
in the book of your website.

00:45:49.720 --> 00:45:55.500
The title of your document is,
again, the title of the document.

00:45:55.500 --> 00:45:58.760
So it makes sense that it
says, this page, this post is

00:45:58.760 --> 00:46:02.050
about build an accessible
post demonstration.

00:46:02.050 --> 00:46:02.910
That is my H1.

00:46:02.910 --> 00:46:05.610
That is defining the document.

00:46:05.610 --> 00:46:08.010
And it's using the H1 as the title.

00:46:08.010 --> 00:46:12.330
So this is the whole...
There should only be one H1 per page.

00:46:12.330 --> 00:46:14.400
I've heard whether
certain exceptions,

00:46:14.401 --> 00:46:16.440
I haven't come across a time
when I need it.

00:46:16.440 --> 00:46:19.080
So did that answer the question?

00:46:19.080 --> 00:46:19.895
 <v Laura> Yes

00:46:19.896 --> 00:46:22.340
 <v Peter> In effect,
the H1 is equivalent.

00:46:22.340 --> 00:46:24.820
If you were to look at this in
the back end, it would be H1.

00:46:24.820 --> 00:46:26.110
<v Laura> Sounds good.

00:46:26.110 --> 00:46:30.280
Yes, that was always like a confusing
thing, especially as a new beginner

00:46:30.280 --> 00:46:35.750
of doing the hierarchy of
the headings and stuff.

00:46:35.750 --> 00:46:37.610
 <v Peter> Yes, go ahead.

00:46:38.467 --> 00:46:40.810
 <v Laura> A couple of people
were asking about the site

00:46:40.810 --> 00:46:41.440
that you were using.

00:46:41.440 --> 00:46:43.770
So we did put that
into the chat again.

00:46:45.320 --> 00:46:48.530
So I wanted to make sure
that people got that.

00:46:48.530 --> 00:46:50.510
<v Peter> The actual site
I'm working on right here?

00:46:50.510 --> 00:46:51.240
<v Laura> Yes.

00:46:51.240 --> 00:46:52.140
<v Peter> Yes.

00:46:52.140 --> 00:46:53.210
I mean, feel free.

00:46:53.210 --> 00:46:54.600
This is live.

00:46:54.600 --> 00:46:56.640
This is my site.

00:46:56.640 --> 00:46:58.070
It is chock full.

00:46:58.070 --> 00:46:59.280
I mean, this is the funny part.

00:46:59.280 --> 00:47:03.640
So the links that I had going to
this page is intentionally blank

00:47:03.640 --> 00:47:06.270
because I'm not building
out the whole site.

00:47:06.270 --> 00:47:08.690
But I hope for encouragement
for people who want to see this

00:47:08.690 --> 00:47:14.030
from a DIY practical approach,
a big part of what I want

00:47:14.030 --> 00:47:15.860
to do are experiments.

00:47:17.550 --> 00:47:20.550
When I go through and test
headings and how they work

00:47:20.550 --> 00:47:23.960
with different blocks and
what's being read and not read

00:47:23.960 --> 00:47:24.940
and things like that.

00:47:24.940 --> 00:47:27.010
So I want to do a lot of that here.

00:47:27.010 --> 00:47:31.210
But right now,
the main reason for this to exist is

00:47:31.210 --> 00:47:34.580
for this presentation, which is
why these are the core links.

00:47:34.580 --> 00:47:37.570
You can now see the demonstration
links are what we created.

00:47:37.570 --> 00:47:40.050
The post-source content is
what I was copying from,

00:47:40.050 --> 00:47:43.040
which should pretty much be
the same thing right now.

00:47:43.040 --> 00:47:46.644
 <v Laura> Alice was
asking about Astra

00:47:46.645 --> 00:47:49.970
and if it's an accessible template.

00:47:49.970 --> 00:47:51.870
Do you have any knowledge of Astra?

00:47:51.870 --> 00:47:58.600
<v Peter> When I used Astra, I'm one of
those who have the lifetime package.

00:48:00.070 --> 00:48:05.382
It was on one of my top
lists of themes to use,

00:48:05.383 --> 00:48:07.200
and accessibility was key.

00:48:07.200 --> 00:48:11.720
I'll be honest, I haven't used it
very recently and I caught wind

00:48:11.720 --> 00:48:14.070
that there's a couple
things to pay attention to.

00:48:14.070 --> 00:48:18.690
I think anything that exists, they'll
work on and they're receptive to.

00:48:18.690 --> 00:48:23.290
So if we want to,
and we're coming up on time,

00:48:23.290 --> 00:48:26.070
but I could even just swap in a theme
and we can see what it looks like.

00:48:27.240 --> 00:48:29.680
 <v Laura> We have several
questions, so let's get through

00:48:29.680 --> 00:48:30.570
the questions first.

00:48:30.570 --> 00:48:31.090
 <v Peter> Yes

00:48:31.090 --> 00:48:34.370
 <v Laura> Anonymous has
asked, I've heard that links

00:48:34.370 --> 00:48:39.510
that take place immediately before
punctuation, like contact us,

00:48:39.510 --> 00:48:43.090
for example, with the words
linking to a contact page

00:48:43.090 --> 00:48:45.720
should include the
punctuation in the link

00:48:45.720 --> 00:48:53.720
so that the screen reader
pairs the information correctly

00:48:54.990 --> 00:48:56.640
and doesn't read the punctuation.

00:48:56.640 --> 00:48:57.600
Is this accurate?

00:48:58.867 --> 00:49:00.730
 <v Peter> I'll be very honest
with you, I do not know.

00:49:00.730 --> 00:49:03.720
I've never included
punctuation in the link.

00:49:03.720 --> 00:49:08.020
<v Laura> If somebody could answer that
in the chat, that would be great.

00:49:08.020 --> 00:49:10.730
 <v Peter> Yes,
I've simply not heard that before.

00:49:13.080 --> 00:49:16.240
But what's beautiful about
this is this is all about,

00:49:17.430 --> 00:49:20.060
you learn by doing, by teaching.

00:49:20.060 --> 00:49:22.047
Laura, you and I are doing that,

00:49:22.048 --> 00:49:24.530
where it's a great
approach to things.

00:49:24.530 --> 00:49:29.150
So a lot of this was
prompted because,

00:49:29.150 --> 00:49:32.150
Amber Hinds herself was
asking a question about tables

00:49:32.150 --> 00:49:33.480
and accessible tables.

00:49:33.480 --> 00:49:36.770
And another presentation I did,
I kind of went through a process

00:49:36.770 --> 00:49:41.340
of how to make the WordPress
core table accessible.

00:49:41.340 --> 00:49:43.950
The only problem was somebody
called me on the fact that, yes,

00:49:43.950 --> 00:49:45.460
but it doesn't work
on a mobile phone.

00:49:45.460 --> 00:49:49.010
In other words, tables don't
look good on a mobile phone,

00:49:49.010 --> 00:49:50.950
and there would be a whole
process to go through for that,

00:49:50.950 --> 00:49:52.210
what you show is visible or not.

00:49:52.210 --> 00:49:53.530
So no time for that.

00:49:53.530 --> 00:49:56.290
That could be its own full
presentation, which I'll probably do

00:49:56.290 --> 00:49:57.740
at some point.

00:49:57.740 --> 00:50:00.310
 <v Laura> Sherry was asking,
and I think you answered this,

00:50:00.310 --> 00:50:05.210
if there is typing an image,
will a screen reader not see it?

00:50:05.210 --> 00:50:09.660
If you had the image of the
WordPress accessibility,

00:50:09.660 --> 00:50:13.830
and you had the words
in the alt text.

00:50:13.830 --> 00:50:14.590
 <v Peter> Correct, yes.

00:50:14.590 --> 00:50:19.150
So you want to make sure that
if in this particular case,

00:50:19.150 --> 00:50:27.150
this has accessibility, advocate
for equal access, and you want

00:50:27.870 --> 00:50:29.760
to include that in your alt text.

00:50:29.760 --> 00:50:32.613
Again,
if I can read it on the screen,

00:50:32.614 --> 00:50:34.880
because it's part of an image,

00:50:34.880 --> 00:50:36.500
then it should be
part of the alt text.

00:50:40.533 --> 00:50:43.120
 <v Laura> Let's see,
this is from anonymous.

00:50:43.120 --> 00:50:46.490
Is the skip to content
part of the cadence theme?

00:50:46.490 --> 00:50:47.880
 <v Peter> Yes.

00:50:47.880 --> 00:50:51.580
<v Laura> How would you add
that if it is not included?

00:50:51.580 --> 00:50:56.350
 <v Peter> Joel Dolson's
plug-in,, WP Accessibility.

00:50:57.870 --> 00:51:00.850
He's got a nice neat plug-in.

00:51:00.850 --> 00:51:03.180
I was going to put out on the
list, I simply didn't need it

00:51:03.180 --> 00:51:04.350
for what we were doing today.

00:51:04.350 --> 00:51:07.720
So I didn't want to throw it
in, but he does.

00:51:07.720 --> 00:51:12.490
Built into that is the
skip to content capability.

00:51:13.433 --> 00:51:15.490
 <v Laura> All right,
well, that is our time.

00:51:15.490 --> 00:51:17.270
Thank you for attending.

00:51:17.270 --> 00:51:18.610
Thank you, Peter.

00:51:18.610 --> 00:51:19.260
 <v Peter> You're welcome.

00:51:20.633 --> 00:51:23.990
 <v Laura> You can continue

00:51:23.990 --> 00:51:31.990
or on social media using

Accessibility and Privacy

00:52:00.700 --> 00:52:03.560

00:52:03.560 --> 00:52:11.030
Coming up with Denata and
Hans, who I actually know too,
