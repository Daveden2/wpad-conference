 AMBER HINDS: WordPress
Accessibility Day 2023:

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.250
Building an Accessible Theme
for Accessible First Sites.

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.030
Gen Herres,
WordPress developer and FIRA LLC.

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:16.640
Presentation recorded
on September 28, 2023.

00:00:19.565 --> 00:00:20.460
JASON FERRERA: All right.

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:21.640
Well, hello everybody.

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.440
To those of you who are
joining for the first time now,

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.830
welcome and for those of
you who are coming back,

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:33.160
welcome back to WordPress
Accessibility Day 2023.

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.970
My name is Jason Ferrera
and in my day job,

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:40.340
I am the Accessibility Lead for
consumer products at Dow Jones.

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.590
But for today, I will be your host.

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:47.950
And thank you everybody for joining
us, for Building an Accessible theme

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:52.010
for Accessible first
sites with Gen Herres.

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:01.180
Gen is the owner at FIRA LLC,
a developer of the easy A11Y guide

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:04.960
and organizes the Baltimore
WordPress meetup group.

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.560
Prior to getting into WordPress
development more than a decade ago,

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.010
Gen was a developer for
Boeing on the B1 bomber

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:14.384
and was a lecturer at
Ohio State University's

00:01:14.385 --> 00:01:15.880
Computer Science department.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.030
Gen has been featured in
podcasts and won the 2022 member

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.610
of the year award in the
number one WordPress community.

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:28.260
She is very active in WordPress
groups, encouraging other developers

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:29.490
and designers.

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.413
She has been incorporating
accessibility

00:01:31.414 --> 00:01:32.680
into websites for a couple

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:35.880
of years and is a strong
advocate of processes

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.070
that either move accessibility
earlier in a project

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:42.970
or make accessibility easier
to understand for novices.

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:45.940
One last bit of
housekeeping for attendees.

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:50.040
Please feel free to add your
questions in the zoom Q&A section,

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.050
and we'll answer them at
the end of this session.

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:55.450
Please use the chat to
connect with other attendees

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.770
and that way it’s a
little bit cleaner

00:01:58.771 --> 00:02:01.580
to find where the questions are.

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:03.320
And with that, that's my bit done.

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:04.910
So I will turn it over to you, Gen.

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:08.240
Without further ado.

00:02:09.823 --> 00:02:10.980
GEN: Thank you, Jason.

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:13.350
Share.

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.050
Hopefully everyone
can see my screen.

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.000
Jason, can you just confirm?

00:02:18.528 --> 00:02:19.370
JASON: I can see your screen.

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.670
GEN: Excellent.

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.960
So today's talk is Building
an Accessible Theme

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.380
for Accessible First Sites.

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.680
So accessibility within your theme,
what we're going to cover today.

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.100
The earlier in the process that
you solve for accessibility,

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.930
the less expensive it is.

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.190
When I've been doing
builds for over a decade,

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:47.210
the earlier we solve a problem,
the less expensive it is.

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:51.520
Spending an extra 20
minutes on something early

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:56.860
in the design stage can end
up saving us dozens of hours

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:58.490
at the end of the build.

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:02.410
So I really try and encourage
things to get done earlier.

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:06.690
And so when possible, if my theme
can handle the accessibility for me,

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:10.790
it is already solved, and I do not
have to worry about it at the end.

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:14.440
So we are going to talk about what
themes can do for accessibility

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.050
and what they can not.

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:21.300
What the accessibility ready tag
covers, what it does not cover.

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:25.750
We are going to do this while
testing two themes side by side

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.640
for accessibility.

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.950
And then I am going to discuss
in some more detail some features

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:35.690
within the Kaya theme and what I
have done with it over the years.

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:42.760
A little quick terminology,
WCAG is the Web Content

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.230
Accessibility Guidelines
and these are maintained

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:49.640
by the World Wide Web
Consortium or W3C.

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:52.970
I will use WCAG many times
in this presentation.

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.620
Accessibility ready.

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:02.190
This is a specific tag used in
the WordPress theme repository.

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:06.240
And it basically means,
meets some guidelines.

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:09.570
And we'll get into exactly which
ones it does, and does not meet.

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:15.550
And then A11Y, which is an
abbreviation for accessibility.

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:18.000
If I remember correctly,
it came out of Twitter

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.740
where they were trying to squeeze
everything into 150 characters.

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:24.560
And so a lot of words
were getting abbreviated.

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:28.490
It removes 11 characters
between A and Y.

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:32.410
And I also love it because it's
frequently pronounced ally or ally,

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:37.000
which means a friend
of or an associate of.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.670
And I like to try and be a friend
to people with various disabilities.

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:47.550
Slides and links are available,
and I will have this link

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:49.780
on like the first
seven or eight slides.

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:56.080
What theme accessibility
is, and is not.

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:01.860
Your theme is basically
your foundation.

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:05.450
And you can either start
out with a good foundation,

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:08.720
or you can end up fighting
yourself and having

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:12.850
all these different barriers
to deal with over time.

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:17.020
And I would prefer to start
with a nice good foundation.

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:22.270
But theme accessibility is
not actually comprehensive.

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:26.270
It can not do absolutely
everything for you.

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:30.460
A lot of accessibility is
in how you add your content,

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:32.630
and of course in
the various plug-ins

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:35.120
and additional functionality
you add to a website.

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:43.790
An important thing to remember
when talking about plug-ins,

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:47.720
and page builders and even
Gutenberg itself, is that many

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:52.940
of these have accessibility issues
and it's important to check into

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:59.310
what you are using before you
actually use it, and of course test.

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:01.950
And we're going to do a ton
of hands-on testing in this,

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:05.160
so it's hopefully going to be
really helpful in getting you going

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:06.320
on testing your own stuff.

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:12.000
We are going to be comparing
two themes side by side.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.610
The first one is the Kaya
theme, which is mine,

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:18.520
and it's been designed
with accessibility in mind.

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:23.440
The second one is the Divi theme.

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:26.190
Now I was specifically
looking for a theme

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:30.690
that I knew had a number of failures,
and so I know that Divi does.

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:35.140
And they also purport to be the
most popular WordPress theme.

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:39.400
And as we all know, just because
something's popular does not mean

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:40.400
it's good.

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:45.340
For this, we will be using
the official test data

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:46.980
from the theme unit test.

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:51.740
So one of the things that I like
about spinning up test sites

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:57.080
when comparing different themes is
that I get a much better comparison

00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:58.680
of apples to apples.

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:02.430
If I try and actually look at
some of their example demos,

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:07.170
things are just so customized and
so different between the demos,

00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:10.400
I can not really get a
good comparison and see

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:14.290
what is being done by the
theme versus what is being done

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:17.520
by the content and the
choices that have been made.

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:24.550
So the Accessibility
Ready Tag; This is the tag

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:30.390
in the WordPress repository,
and it means it covers some content.

00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:34.710
So we are going to go off

00:07:34.711 --> 00:07:38.120
to the actual WordPress
repository information.

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:40.700
And we are going to look
at the required tag,

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:43.250
and we're actually going
to go through and explain

00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:47.590
what this required tag is,
what it means within your theme,

00:07:47.590 --> 00:07:49.450
why some of these
things even exist.

00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:52.740
So the first one is
Keyboard Navigation.

00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:58.780
Can someone who does not use
a mouse navigate your website?

00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:01.290
Well, as I look at my desk,
I do not even have a mouse.

00:08:01.290 --> 00:08:02.470
I do not use one.

00:08:02.470 --> 00:08:04.700
It actually bothers my
hand to use a mouse.

00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:10.080
So I actually sit here with this
pen on a big wake-up tablet.

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:15.080
So I already get some benefits
and I do actually use a little bit

00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:18.660
of screen navigation sometimes.

00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:22.340
One of the first things I'll
actually check before I even get

00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:26.470
into keyboard now is I will
do a quick lighthouse test.

00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:29.080
So here we have the
Kaya demo website,

00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:31.820
and I have imported
the demo content.

00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:36.150
I have configured just
a couple of widgets.

00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:38.550
So I've configured
some footer widgets.

00:08:38.550 --> 00:08:42.380
Just a couple of things are
configured very, very little.

00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:45.710
And I have done the exact
same on the Divi install.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.890
Again, I've configured some
widgets, but otherwise

00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:53.670
I have not configured options.

00:08:56.670 --> 00:09:01.170
So here we can see out of
the box the Divi has a 79.

00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:05.950
Now Lighthouse has a
more limited set of tests

00:09:05.950 --> 00:09:08.980
than some of the other
tools such as AX or WAV.

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:15.520
So the fact that they are
already scoring 79 as a lot

00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:16.910
of things have not passed.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.130
So here we can see
this includes a form.

00:09:21.130 --> 00:09:22.790
This is the search form.

00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:25.040
And we can see that
it's missing labels.

00:09:26.430 --> 00:09:29.930
Links don't have a discernible
name, not a great thing.

00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:34.740
The user scalable has been
set to know, which means

00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:39.990
that there is a limit to how
much this website can be zoomed.

00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:42.930
This is a problem for
people with poor vision

00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:46.370
as some of them do
a ton of zooming.

00:09:46.370 --> 00:09:49.480
I know people who literally
zoomed to over 1000%.

00:09:55.600 --> 00:10:01.640
Now contrast issues are not
typically a huge issue in themes,

00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:06.360
as many themes allow you to actually
set your own color palettes.

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:10.630
But for the accessibility ready
tag, it does require that all

00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:17.020
of the contrast by
default meet the 4.5 to 1.

00:10:20.290 --> 00:10:23.980
And of course, this is an
issue with heading elements are

00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:25.240
in non-sequential order.

00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:30.250
That means that by default this
theme has done specific coding

00:10:30.250 --> 00:10:36.560
to typically make elements such as
the sidebar out of order on headings.

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:40.520
That is really not a great start
because that typically requires

00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:42.500
a lot of code to overwrite that.

00:10:47.530 --> 00:10:49.460
As you can see, I added fine.

00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:51.390
So now we are going
to take it over to AX.

00:10:52.650 --> 00:10:58.920
And in the AX, I am just going to
scan all of my page and it says,

00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:01.000
no automatic issues.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.550
So basically that means that on
their tests, there were no problems.

00:11:06.210 --> 00:11:08.930
Now these tests are
not all encompassing,

00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:10.310
but they are a pretty
good foundation.

00:11:11.410 --> 00:11:13.260
And we'll run the same here.

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:16.030
We had 30 automatic issues.

00:11:16.030 --> 00:11:20.460
And one of the things I like about
AX is that it does categorize issues.

00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:22.740
Critical, serious,
moderate, and minor.

00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:25.770
Well, critical is not great.

00:11:28.070 --> 00:11:31.200
Form elements are missing
labels again,here.

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:36.230
This is an intentional decision
by Divi to explicitly hide

00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:38.820
from everyone the label
on the search field.

00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:43.010
Zooming and scaling
are not to be disabled.

00:11:43.010 --> 00:11:46.980
Again, they intentionally
disabled the ability

00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:48.610
to zoom beyond a certain threshold.

00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:53.410
The color contrast,
I am not too worried about.

00:11:53.410 --> 00:11:54.820
The links are an issue.

00:11:56.860 --> 00:12:00.610
The ID value is not
always an issue.

00:12:00.610 --> 00:12:02.900
That's why it's categorized
here in Axis minor.

00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:09.910
So we will now get on
to the keyboard test.

00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:15.610
Put your cursor in the URL bar,
and then on your keyboard, hit Tab.

00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:20.540
And absolutely nothing happened.

00:12:22.170 --> 00:12:24.090
This is not a good start.

00:12:24.090 --> 00:12:32.090
I'm repeatedly hitting Tab and
absolutely nothing is happening.

00:12:35.470 --> 00:12:41.700
So basically someone using a keyboard
cannot navigate this site whatsoever

00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:44.190
because I can not see anything.

00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:46.900
So that is not good.

00:12:48.770 --> 00:12:51.760
Here I immediately get
a skip to content link.

00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:52.450
That is great.

00:12:52.450 --> 00:12:55.530
That means that if I want
to skip over the menu bar

00:12:55.530 --> 00:12:57.440
and go straight into the
content, I can.

00:13:00.140 --> 00:13:04.310
But I am going to go through...
Here we have a double outline

00:13:04.310 --> 00:13:10.190
on the focus state, which means
that we have a dark gray background,

00:13:10.190 --> 00:13:14.340
and it has both a blue
and a white outline.

00:13:14.340 --> 00:13:16.440
So we can clearly see
that white outline.

00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:25.930
The search is highlighted
with a blue border.

00:13:25.930 --> 00:13:28.880
The button gets a blue
and white outline.

00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:34.040
As we move through the menu,
these are clearly getting focused.

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:38.280
We can make it through
all of the menus.

00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:42.500
Now, would it be slightly more
ideal if we could use arrow keys

00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:47.280
to manage some of those menus and get
out of some of those deeper menus?

00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:48.300
Yes.

00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:52.550
I generally recommend using
the Max Mega Menu plug-in,

00:13:52.550 --> 00:13:56.890
as that has done pretty
good job of improving menus.

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:01.230
So let's take a look
at the next item.

00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:04.620
Controls.

00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:07.250
So basically this means that
elements that are a button

00:14:07.250 --> 00:14:09.921
and elements that are
input and elements

00:14:09.922 --> 00:14:12.940
that are an anchor must behave
as they are supposed to.

00:14:14.590 --> 00:14:18.220
Essentially this means Divs
and spans are not buttons

00:14:19.690 --> 00:14:23.270
and they should not be
used by the theme as them.

00:14:23.270 --> 00:14:27.920
Most themes do not actually
create too many issues.

00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:32.130
The biggest one would be
typically menu toggles.

00:14:32.130 --> 00:14:35.817
Now as we have seen
this Divi theme is

00:14:35.818 --> 00:14:39.220
already creating a lot of problems.

00:14:39.220 --> 00:14:42.420
So it is going to be
very hard to even test

00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:46.640
whether or not it has any
issues with the keyboard.

00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:52.690
Next we have Skip Links.

00:14:56.070 --> 00:14:58.850
And who do the skip links benefit?

00:14:58.850 --> 00:15:01.920
The skip link is that very first
link that I showed you here

00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:04.420
at the top,
and it says skip to content.

00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:09.350
This allows people using a keyboard
to skip your entire header area

00:15:09.350 --> 00:15:12.900
and main menu and go straight
to your main content.

00:15:12.900 --> 00:15:16.260
This is a really handy thing
for people who use keyboards.

00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:21.060
Obviously the Divi
theme did not have that.

00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:27.460
Forms; for these form guidelines,
it basically is looking

00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:30.650
for a label element
must be visible.

00:15:30.650 --> 00:15:37.010
Here we can see that on the Divi
theme, there is a label element

00:15:37.010 --> 00:15:40.150
that is included by WordPress core.

00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:44.990
However, they have chosen to put a
display none, which hides this label

00:15:44.990 --> 00:15:45.990
from everyone.

00:15:50.030 --> 00:15:53.790
Here you can see on the Kaya theme,
that the label is right there.

00:15:57.030 --> 00:15:59.930
Headings; using
correct heading order.

00:16:01.170 --> 00:16:06.190
So in this case, we will take a
look at these headings down here

00:16:06.190 --> 00:16:07.200
in the footer.

00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:10.640
And what you will see is
that this heading is an H3,

00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:14.170
and there is a screen reader
heading that is an H2.

00:16:14.170 --> 00:16:19.870
So we have here on the page your H1,
then we have the screen reader level

00:16:19.870 --> 00:16:21.150
for a footer.

00:16:21.150 --> 00:16:22.840
What a lot of people with
screen readers do is,

00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:25.610
they can actually navigate
the website by getting a list

00:16:25.610 --> 00:16:27.040
of all the headings.

00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:31.280
So putting this footer heading
here, as a screen reader

00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:34.590
heading allows them to immediately
jump straight to footer.

00:16:36.340 --> 00:16:40.780
And then within the footer,
you want things labeled as an H3

00:16:40.780 --> 00:16:41.780
and appropriate.

00:16:45.370 --> 00:16:51.550
Here on Divi, you can take a
look, and it has labeled.

00:16:52.630 --> 00:16:56.020
We have these H3s,
but there's no H2s.

00:16:57.910 --> 00:17:04.650
Now, these headings are sometimes
setable, depending on what type

00:17:04.650 --> 00:17:05.650
of heading they are.

00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:13.300
So for example, here, the short Nav
menu, this would be actually coded

00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:16.793
by the theme,
so it's jumping straight to an H4,

00:17:16.794 --> 00:17:18.290
so that is not good.

00:17:22.330 --> 00:17:24.400
So, we have seen the headings.

00:17:25.690 --> 00:17:27.130
Aria landmark roles.

00:17:28.340 --> 00:17:32.430
Basically, it means use the
appropriate types of elements

00:17:32.430 --> 00:17:34.210
for the appropriate stuff.

00:17:34.210 --> 00:17:35.990
So role equals search form.

00:17:37.290 --> 00:17:40.080
This content is actually
added by WordPress core.

00:17:44.670 --> 00:17:52.550
And this is not
actually adding a role.

00:17:52.550 --> 00:17:54.770
But again,
that is part of WordPress core

00:17:54.770 --> 00:17:57.390
and that is not really the
responsibility of the theme.

00:17:57.390 --> 00:18:00.450
Most themes do not actually
add their own forms.

00:18:02.860 --> 00:18:05.380
Navigation menu
should have a Nav tag.

00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:11.050
So we will take a look here, we have
a URL and it does include a Nav tag.

00:18:11.050 --> 00:18:13.070
It is showing header tags.

00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:17.270
The main body will
typically use a main tag,

00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:26.400
and if it does not use a main tag,
it should use a role equals main.

00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:29.420
And here we can see that Divi
is doing neither of those.

00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:34.590
So here we can take a
look and we have main.

00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:40.720
So that is the main
content, we have the header,

00:18:42.490 --> 00:18:46.640
we have the footer,
so those are showing up well.

00:18:47.670 --> 00:18:51.850
And again, this is specifically for
things that are done by the theme.

00:18:51.850 --> 00:18:56.640
So if it's one of the WordPress
blocks, that's not the theme's fault.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.920
Content links; So links within
the content should be underlined.

00:19:06.830 --> 00:19:09.280
This particular page
does not have any links.

00:19:10.420 --> 00:19:14.250
Here you can see on the sidebar
that we have lots of links

00:19:14.250 --> 00:19:16.240
and those are all underlined.

00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:20.100
That's basically telling us that
things are underlined by default.

00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:22.380
Here we are,
we see our links and our content.

00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:32.300
And sample page is
not showing in this.

00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:33.300
There we go.

00:19:35.090 --> 00:19:38.060
So here we can see that
these are not underlined.

00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:43.400
So that is an automatic
failure of this criteria.

00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:51.980
Repetitive link text; This is
typically done on a blog page.

00:19:51.980 --> 00:19:55.370
So sometimes on blog pages,
you will see the read more

00:19:55.370 --> 00:19:57.710
or read more or continue
reading types of links.

00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:04.960
This page is not using any of
those, so it does not really apply.

00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:08.650
But if you were using
them, then you would need

00:20:08.650 --> 00:20:12.220
to show that the links were unique.

00:20:12.220 --> 00:20:13.680
So here we have Read More.

00:20:18.710 --> 00:20:22.680
And you can see that in the Read
More, we have screen reader text,

00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:25.680
which tells you what article
you are reading more of.

00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:30.430
So that allows for
link differentiation

00:20:30.430 --> 00:20:32.340
and meets the
repetitive link issue.

00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:37.340
And here you can even see in their
example with the repetitive link

00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:38.940
how they use screen reader text.

00:20:41.260 --> 00:20:45.140
Contrast; This basically means
that the default theme colors need

00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:46.930
to pass contrast.

00:20:46.930 --> 00:20:50.860
As we saw from the automated
checker, they passed fine

00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:52.530
and they failed in Divi.

00:20:56.380 --> 00:21:01.810
Images; When the theme is inserting
images, it should allow for alt text.

00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:06.910
So let's take a look at an
image that is typically inserted

00:21:06.910 --> 00:21:13.380
by the theme, and that would be the
hero image or the logo for the site.

00:21:13.380 --> 00:21:17.170
We have an image, and we can see
that it does in fact have alt text.

00:21:17.170 --> 00:21:19.350
We will take a look at Divi.

00:21:21.540 --> 00:21:26.230
And, well, I happened to
put some bad alt text in

00:21:26.230 --> 00:21:30.080
because I had originally started
this with hello elementor,

00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:34.090
and then I rapidly discovered
that the hello elementor theme

00:21:34.090 --> 00:21:39.130
had no widgets, no settings, and
was really not a great test theme.

00:21:42.190 --> 00:21:47.970
So that is on me for not having
corrected the image alt text there.

00:21:53.830 --> 00:21:56.160
Next is Media.

00:21:56.160 --> 00:22:01.150
So media resources that are done
by the theme should not auto start.

00:22:02.340 --> 00:22:05.055
Basically, this is if your
theme includes something special

00:22:05.056 --> 00:22:05.960
like a slider.

00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:12.080
Neither of these themes in the
absolute default configuration

00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:13.080
include that.

00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:18.820
Screen reader text.

00:22:18.820 --> 00:22:20.807
So it is great to include

00:22:20.808 --> 00:22:24.780
the official WordPress
screen reader text class.

00:22:24.780 --> 00:22:27.830
As we have already seen,
the kaya theme includes it.

00:22:27.830 --> 00:22:31.220
I am honestly not sure whether
or not Divi includes it or not.

00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:40.920
Wow, Divi does not even mark this
up into a paragraph or even a Div.

00:22:42.420 --> 00:22:45.550
This has no content.

00:22:45.550 --> 00:22:45.690
OK.

00:22:45.690 --> 00:22:49.900
Well, I am just going to
make this a paragraph.

00:22:54.130 --> 00:22:59.080
And then at the end, I am going
to add some screen reader text

00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:00.950
and see if it actually does.

00:23:13.230 --> 00:23:15.690
So again, I just modified
this text underneath.

00:23:15.690 --> 00:23:19.740
Hello World, and we are
seeing that it does, in fact,

00:23:19.740 --> 00:23:22.020
hide the screen reader and
does support that class.

00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:23.020
So that's nice.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:29.500
Finally, under the required are
things that are not permitted.

00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:32.230
And this is typically you
need to do using a code search

00:23:32.230 --> 00:23:33.460
in the actual theme code.

00:23:33.460 --> 00:23:37.390
And that is a positive
tab index attribute,

00:23:38.980 --> 00:23:43.810
inclusion of the access key
attribute, and checking the content

00:23:43.810 --> 00:23:46.440
for underscore blank.

00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:50.490
Now, I have not actually
done that in the code hunt,

00:23:50.490 --> 00:23:56.250
but one thing I can normally
check is the social media icons.

00:23:57.360 --> 00:24:01.410
This is the most common place
for this to occur in a theme.

00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:08.210
And here I can see that the
link is not using target blank.

00:24:08.210 --> 00:24:11.520
So it's not spawning
anything on its own.

00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:14.410
So most likely it is doing OK.

00:24:15.430 --> 00:24:18.520
The other place to check
is the designer links,

00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:21.390
and those are also not
using target blank.

00:24:21.390 --> 00:24:22.390
So that's fine.

00:24:24.540 --> 00:24:26.990
Here I can do the exact same tests.

00:24:28.570 --> 00:24:31.680
And again, we can see that
there's no target blank.

00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:33.880
So we are set.

00:24:35.270 --> 00:24:38.300
So that handles the
accessibility ready tag.

00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:42.890
Now let's talk about things
that this tag does not cover.

00:24:45.110 --> 00:24:47.350
First of all,
it does not cover anything outside

00:24:47.350 --> 00:24:49.680
the official WordPress repository.

00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:53.210
And there are lots of themes
that are not in the repository

00:24:53.210 --> 00:24:55.130
for many different reasons.

00:24:55.130 --> 00:24:59.860
Some of them are paid themes and paid
themes can not be in the repository.

00:24:59.860 --> 00:25:03.240
Some are just the theme
author did not feel like going

00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:07.850
through all the effort and rigmarole
to get it into the repository.

00:25:07.850 --> 00:25:11.000
And other times,
the theme authors disagree

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:15.450
with some of the specific
requirements of the repository.

00:25:15.450 --> 00:25:19.211
For example, short codes are
not allowed in any themes

00:25:19.212 --> 00:25:20.510
in the repository.

00:25:20.510 --> 00:25:23.530
This is not become short codes
are evil, this is a choice

00:25:23.530 --> 00:25:26.180
that the repository team has made.

00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:32.640
The actual theme review process
can easily take over a month

00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:35.340
for themes trying to
get into the repository.

00:25:35.340 --> 00:25:39.660
And there is a very small group of
people who are actually qualified

00:25:39.660 --> 00:25:43.170
to test the
accessibility ready tag.

00:25:43.170 --> 00:25:48.190
So having that tag on a theme can
mean it takes significantly longer,

00:25:48.190 --> 00:25:52.630
possibly even six months or
more to get that theme reviewed.

00:25:52.630 --> 00:25:55.810
So for this reason,
many themes have not chosen

00:25:55.810 --> 00:25:58.650
to go after the
accessibility ready tag,

00:25:58.650 --> 00:26:02.150
even though they have plenty
of accessibility in them.

00:26:03.260 --> 00:26:07.400
So just because something does
not have the tag, or it is not

00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:11.210
in the repository should not
disqualify you from using it.

00:26:18.970 --> 00:26:21.040
Here we are going to talk
about some of the things

00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:23.920
that the accessibility
ready tag does not cover,

00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:27.660
but could be of an
issue in a theme.

00:26:27.660 --> 00:26:29.500
First one is use of color.

00:26:30.910 --> 00:26:36.750
Now, it's not super common, but I
have seen some themes that include

00:26:36.750 --> 00:26:44.300
as a theme element,
a pricing table with yes and no.

00:26:44.300 --> 00:26:48.590
So in that pricing table if
you were to have a green square

00:26:48.590 --> 00:26:52.440
for yes, and a red square for
no, that would be a failure

00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:57.380
if you were to use a green checkbox
for yes, and a red X for no.

00:26:57.380 --> 00:27:00.660
That would pass because
it's not only color.

00:27:02.420 --> 00:27:05.500
Page titles are not
checked by this.

00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:08.830
Basically,
pages should have useful titles.

00:27:08.830 --> 00:27:14.740
This is typically just the name
of the page here in the title bar.

00:27:14.740 --> 00:27:20.020
And as you can see, both of these
themes do have page titles included.

00:27:21.980 --> 00:27:25.290
Language of page; Language of
page does need to be included

00:27:25.290 --> 00:27:31.090
and that is absolutely a theme item
that comes here in the HTML tag,

00:27:31.090 --> 00:27:32.110
E-N-U-S.

00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:39.510
And again here, E-N-U-S..
So those are showing that both

00:27:39.510 --> 00:27:40.840
of those have the language.

00:27:42.370 --> 00:27:46.500
Focus no change; when
something received focus,

00:27:46.500 --> 00:27:49.550
it should not create
a change of context.

00:27:49.550 --> 00:27:53.750
Now this I have seen on
a couple of sites where

00:27:53.750 --> 00:27:57.770
when I focus on something
on the left, something over

00:27:57.770 --> 00:28:00.320
on the right changes.

00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:06.640
For example, a vertical carousel
of options where it highlights

00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:12.320
that this theme is responsive,
this theme has color choices.

00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:17.310
And then on the right side,
it changes a whole bunch of content.

00:28:17.310 --> 00:28:22.330
Well, that is not good because
that content may not be visible

00:28:22.330 --> 00:28:25.370
to the user, especially someone
using a screen magnifier.

00:28:25.370 --> 00:28:28.650
They have no idea that a whole
bunch of other content is changing

00:28:28.650 --> 00:28:31.260
just because they switched
what item was in focus.

00:28:34.590 --> 00:28:38.960
On inputs, things should not
suddenly do more changes.

00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:46.090
Resizing of text; Resizing of text
is a really easy one to check.

00:28:48.590 --> 00:28:52.130
So, I am actually going to do
this in a separate browser window

00:28:52.130 --> 00:28:59.230
just because that's where my browser
is going to open my settings.

00:28:59.230 --> 00:29:06.270
So in your browser, you go to
font size and in the font size,

00:29:06.270 --> 00:29:07.680
it currently says medium.

00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:13.900
And if I switch to very large,
the website should change.

00:29:13.900 --> 00:29:16.590
It should respect my font sizes.

00:29:16.590 --> 00:29:21.060
There are a lot of other tools which
allow you to change the font size,

00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:25.150
but this is one of the easiest
ways to quickly test it.

00:29:26.790 --> 00:29:29.880
So here we are on the Divi site
and I'm going to do the same thing.

00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:34.830
I'm switching to very large and
absolutely nothing happened.

00:29:36.410 --> 00:29:40.550
And I have switched back to medium
and still nothing has happened.

00:29:40.550 --> 00:29:44.870
So that's showing that this does not
respect people's font preferences.

00:29:47.510 --> 00:29:48.330
Responsive.

00:29:48.330 --> 00:29:49.720
Website needs to be responsive.

00:29:51.180 --> 00:29:53.720
Sadly, in this day and age,
we still have to say this.

00:29:55.480 --> 00:30:00.720
So all we do to check that is
we just use the options here.

00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:02.390
I'm just testing on an iPhone.

00:30:02.390 --> 00:30:03.910
It works fine.

00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:07.120
Going to test it here.

00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:09.010
Again, it's fine.

00:30:09.010 --> 00:30:10.010
Both of those passed.

00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:13.493
Non-text contrast;

00:30:13.494 --> 00:30:16.300
Clearly identifying user
interface components.

00:30:17.610 --> 00:30:20.200
Here's an example of a
user interface component.

00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:22.510
This is the search area.

00:30:22.510 --> 00:30:26.150
And on this theme,
it has a very light border

00:30:26.150 --> 00:30:30.280
that can be almost impossible for
people with certain vision issues

00:30:30.280 --> 00:30:31.280
to even see.

00:30:32.540 --> 00:30:36.070
Over here, on Kaya,
we have the same search bar.

00:30:36.070 --> 00:30:39.690
And it has a nice dark
border, which is clear

00:30:39.690 --> 00:30:42.150
and meets the contrast
requirements of WCAG.

00:30:44.470 --> 00:30:48.430
Text spacing; Text
spacing can be overridden

00:30:48.430 --> 00:30:50.150
to improve reading experience.

00:30:51.430 --> 00:30:56.190
This one's a little trickier to test
in the browser, but not too hard.

00:30:57.940 --> 00:31:05.940
I can come here and put in
some letter spacing, a 0.2 EM,

00:31:06.620 --> 00:31:07.620
and that worked fine.

00:31:09.330 --> 00:31:15.000
And I can also update my line
height to 1.5, and that worked fine.

00:31:19.050 --> 00:31:20.700
I'll do the same thing over here.

00:31:21.980 --> 00:31:25.790
I will just pop in letter spacing.

00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:31.180
And line height.

00:31:31.180 --> 00:31:33.820
I happen to know that the
line height is already 1.5,

00:31:33.820 --> 00:31:36.110
so I'm just going
to change it to 1.7

00:31:36.110 --> 00:31:39.060
so that you can actually
see the visual difference.

00:31:39.060 --> 00:31:40.480
Worked fine for both of those.

00:31:44.220 --> 00:31:46.450
Next is headings.

00:31:46.450 --> 00:31:49.720
Headings and labels should
describe topic or purpose.

00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:55.890
This is not huge on themes,
but it does come up,

00:31:55.890 --> 00:31:59.930
especially if the theme
has included any widgets.

00:31:59.930 --> 00:32:03.590
So some themes do actually
include Gutenberg blocks,

00:32:03.590 --> 00:32:08.500
they include widgets, those widgets
should have a useful heading.

00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:12.790
So for example,
the Kaya theme includes this widget.

00:32:12.790 --> 00:32:14.700
And it says follow us.

00:32:14.700 --> 00:32:19.230
And then here in the information,
if I inspect it, it says visit us

00:32:19.230 --> 00:32:20.230
on Facebook.

00:32:21.050 --> 00:32:24.350
So that says follow us
visit us on Facebook,

00:32:24.350 --> 00:32:27.980
that's clearly indicating that
we're talking about social media.

00:32:27.980 --> 00:32:30.610
And this is a very common
heading used for social media.

00:32:32.650 --> 00:32:35.350
Consistent use of
buttons and icons.

00:32:35.350 --> 00:32:38.520
This basically means if
something does the same thing

00:32:38.520 --> 00:32:41.560
as something else,
it should have a matching label.

00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:44.740
If two things do radically
different things,

00:32:44.740 --> 00:32:45.990
they should have different labels.

00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:52.970
So for example,
if you had multiple menu areas.

00:32:52.970 --> 00:32:54.870
So here we have a blog page.

00:32:55.890 --> 00:32:59.980
And up top we have a blog page,
and those are consistently labeled

00:32:59.980 --> 00:33:02.120
because they go to
the same locations.

00:33:07.110 --> 00:33:13.790
So, WCAG 2.2 level double
A, is coming out very soon.

00:33:13.790 --> 00:33:16.920
It is expected to be out
before the end of 2023

00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:19.460
and it is basically finalized.

00:33:19.460 --> 00:33:24.950
They may make some very minor notes
about it, but it's pretty much final.

00:33:26.230 --> 00:33:29.160
So one of these is that
focus is not obscured.

00:33:30.550 --> 00:33:34.630
What that means is when someone
is focusing on something,

00:33:34.630 --> 00:33:37.150
that focus is not obscured.

00:33:37.150 --> 00:33:41.700
If a theme had a floating
icon, for example,

00:33:41.700 --> 00:33:45.720
and that floating icon
completely covered something up,

00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:49.940
then that would obscure the element
and it would fail this criteria.

00:33:49.940 --> 00:33:54.970
The element can be partially
obscured in level double A,

00:33:54.970 --> 00:33:57.220
it can not be obscured in triple A.

00:33:59.170 --> 00:34:03.780
The minimum size for clickable
elements is now 24 by 24.

00:34:03.780 --> 00:34:05.200
Now this is a great size.

00:34:06.510 --> 00:34:11.660
One of the things is if you look
at a typical paragraph element,

00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:17.700
I will default my element to ..
I'm actually going

00:34:17.700 --> 00:34:19.660
to grab a smaller element.

00:34:19.660 --> 00:34:20.660
Here we are.

00:34:21.170 --> 00:34:23.700
So here is my element.

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:26.520
It is a link.

00:34:28.510 --> 00:34:35.940
And we can see that the line height
is 1.5 times the font size 16,

00:34:35.940 --> 00:34:38.090
which is 24 pixels.

00:34:38.090 --> 00:34:40.350
So that means that the
height of my element

00:34:40.350 --> 00:34:44.460
is basically automatically
hitting at 24 pixels.

00:34:44.460 --> 00:34:48.230
And as long as I have more
than one character in it,

00:34:48.230 --> 00:34:51.600
and links should have more
than one character in them

00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:55.540
to be a useful link, then it's
going to meet that automatically.

00:34:56.680 --> 00:35:03.390
If we take a look over here at the
Divi theme, we will take a look

00:35:03.390 --> 00:35:07.720
at the font size,
which is set to only 14 pixels,

00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:12.810
but the line height is
at a little smaller,

00:35:12.810 --> 00:35:15.553
and you will see that the
actual rendered element

00:35:15.554 --> 00:35:16.870
is only 19 pixels tall.

00:35:16.870 --> 00:35:19.840
So it is going to be
failing that new criteria.

00:35:22.690 --> 00:35:26.350
If the theme provides inputs
or overrides existing inputs,

00:35:26.350 --> 00:35:28.240
allow copy and paste.

00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:30.580
So this is actually
on authentication,

00:35:30.580 --> 00:35:36.250
and some themes will override
the login page for WordPress,

00:35:36.250 --> 00:35:42.180
or some themes may include
something like a membership system,

00:35:42.180 --> 00:35:46.080
in which case those themes need
to allow for copy and paste

00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:48.030
into the input fields.

00:35:48.030 --> 00:35:52.430
So that people do not have to attempt
to type long complex passwords

00:35:52.430 --> 00:35:53.440
because that's not fun.

00:35:59.950 --> 00:36:03.720
The more things that are kind of
outside of the WCAG requirements

00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:07.320
that are missed, check the
JavaScript console for errors.

00:36:09.510 --> 00:36:13.130
Here we just go to the console and
we see if there are any errors,

00:36:13.130 --> 00:36:14.780
which there are not.

00:36:14.780 --> 00:36:15.780
Great.

00:36:16.450 --> 00:36:18.210
We'll come over here to Divi.

00:36:18.210 --> 00:36:20.050
This is just a notification.

00:36:20.050 --> 00:36:21.250
This is not an error.

00:36:21.250 --> 00:36:25.930
Errors are displayed with
an error symbol and in red

00:36:25.930 --> 00:36:27.190
on the JavaScript console.

00:36:29.380 --> 00:36:32.770
Now, depending on what
browser you are using,

00:36:32.770 --> 00:36:38.530
you may be encountering
some additional errors.

00:36:38.530 --> 00:36:42.810
If your browser is blocking certain
resources from being loaded,

00:36:42.810 --> 00:36:45.205
those are not counted
against the theme

00:36:45.206 --> 00:36:47.240
that is a choice of your browser.

00:36:47.240 --> 00:36:50.640
I use the Brave browser so
I block a lot of things.

00:36:52.150 --> 00:36:54.100
The next one is easy Trial themes.

00:36:55.420 --> 00:36:59.660
I have yet to meet a client who
does not want to customize something

00:36:59.660 --> 00:37:01.970
and then customize
it a whole lot more.

00:37:01.970 --> 00:37:05.900
So a great way to do
customizations is via Trial themes.

00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:11.570
So it's important that your
theme have easy Trial themes.

00:37:11.570 --> 00:37:16.300
Now, the Divi theme does provide
a trial for you that you just have

00:37:16.300 --> 00:37:17.950
to drop in, and then modify.

00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:24.130
And the Kaya theme is set up to
very easily allow for trial themes.

00:37:24.130 --> 00:37:28.990
Literally, you just put a style.css
in there and you are good to go.

00:37:30.170 --> 00:37:32.190
You do not need to
include anything special

00:37:32.190 --> 00:37:34.300
to get the trial theme
CSS to start running.

00:37:37.970 --> 00:37:42.900
Some additional items ensure
that jump links actually jump.

00:37:42.900 --> 00:37:45.260
So I grabbed a different website.

00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:53.880
Here and this has a link which
is called Talk to Us Today,

00:37:53.880 --> 00:37:58.270
and this link uses a smooth scroll
to jump down the page to this form.

00:37:59.410 --> 00:38:04.740
Well, I just clicked a link, so
logically my focus should have jumped

00:38:04.740 --> 00:38:05.740
to this section.

00:38:06.820 --> 00:38:10.630
However, if I go to fill out
the form by using my keyboard

00:38:10.630 --> 00:38:14.240
and I hit Tab,
I jump back up the page

00:38:14.240 --> 00:38:18.520
because it did not move
my focus down the page,

00:38:18.520 --> 00:38:23.070
which is really annoying for
people who use keyboard navigation,

00:38:23.070 --> 00:38:26.670
or who like to use keyboards to fill
out forms, which a lot of people do.

00:38:28.520 --> 00:38:31.200
Checking for inverted colors.

00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:35.750
I have had a few situations
where working with a website

00:38:35.750 --> 00:38:39.780
and inverted colors,
suddenly buttons went from readable

00:38:39.780 --> 00:38:42.170
to completely unreadable.

00:38:42.170 --> 00:38:45.360
There ended up being some
strange CSS going on,

00:38:45.360 --> 00:38:49.290
and the website just did
not work in inverted colors.

00:38:50.690 --> 00:38:55.530
Now, I do not honestly know
if changing my computer

00:38:55.530 --> 00:39:03.530
to inverted colors will
actually show for you or not.

00:39:05.370 --> 00:39:13.370
In my computer's system
preferences under accessibility,

00:39:14.190 --> 00:39:18.130
there is a display section,
and it allows me to invert colors.

00:39:18.130 --> 00:39:19.130
I use a Mac.

00:39:20.210 --> 00:39:24.410
There are also color invert
possibilities for PCs.

00:39:24.410 --> 00:39:26.660
Please check with Microsoft
for directions on that.

00:39:28.040 --> 00:39:30.750
I am going to set invert
colors on my computer.

00:39:33.700 --> 00:39:38.080
I do not honestly know if that is
going to display over zoom or not.

00:39:38.080 --> 00:39:43.470
If Joe or Jason could let me
know whether that is displaying

00:39:43.470 --> 00:39:45.510
or not, as invert.

00:39:48.730 --> 00:39:50.430
JASON: It is not.

00:39:51.680 --> 00:39:53.050
GEN: OK, I did not think
it would over zoom.

00:39:56.390 --> 00:39:59.470
Anyway, check your computer
settings to invert your colors

00:39:59.470 --> 00:40:00.470
and test with those.

00:40:02.630 --> 00:40:05.780
Also, make sure that no
all caps is keyed in.

00:40:07.350 --> 00:40:11.520
So I do not see any of that
on either of these themes,

00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:16.960
which is the content that is
specifically keyed in by the theme.

00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:18.230
I have seen it happen.

00:40:18.230 --> 00:40:24.340
I have seen sometimes where the
theme actually had some demo content,

00:40:24.340 --> 00:40:30.870
had some default widgets where
it was all caps as the heading.

00:40:30.870 --> 00:40:34.840
And that was not desirable because
all caps should only be used

00:40:34.840 --> 00:40:35.840
for acronyms.

00:40:39.110 --> 00:40:41.230
The next one is misuse of Aria.

00:40:42.540 --> 00:40:47.310
So Aria can be kind of
confusing and kind of complex.

00:40:47.310 --> 00:40:49.660
So the best thing to
do if you do not know

00:40:49.660 --> 00:40:51.870
whether or not to use Aria, do not.

00:40:53.430 --> 00:40:56.880
No Aria is better
than poorly done Aria

00:40:56.880 --> 00:40:59.940
because that can end up creating a
nightmare for screen reader users.

00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:03.260
And most of the time
with theme content,

00:41:03.260 --> 00:41:06.500
you should not be
using Aria except for

00:41:06.500 --> 00:41:09.820
if you are doing some
customization of the Nav menu,

00:41:09.820 --> 00:41:11.650
in which case make sure you
know what you are doing.

00:41:14.950 --> 00:41:18.690
Some red flag items to
watch for in themes.

00:41:18.690 --> 00:41:21.960
Do not disable right click
or browser extensions.

00:41:23.150 --> 00:41:26.990
So as you have noticed,
I have used right click a whole lot,

00:41:26.990 --> 00:41:30.660
and a lot of people actually
use right click to access

00:41:30.660 --> 00:41:33.230
some of their accessibility tools.

00:41:33.230 --> 00:41:36.530
For example, something like speech.

00:41:36.530 --> 00:41:39.630
You can have your browser
speak text to you.

00:41:39.630 --> 00:41:43.210
This can be used by a number
of people with dyslexia

00:41:43.210 --> 00:41:46.610
or Erlen syndrome,
or just to have tired eyes.

00:41:47.700 --> 00:41:52.260
And they can just have the computer
read out paragraphs of text

00:41:52.260 --> 00:41:55.920
to them so they do not
have to actually read them.

00:41:55.920 --> 00:41:58.690
This is also really great
for people who are trying

00:41:58.690 --> 00:42:00.600
to learn a second language.

00:42:00.600 --> 00:42:05.930
They can have the computer read out
the text to them so they hear it

00:42:05.930 --> 00:42:08.710
as well as see it and that helps
with learning pronunciation.

00:42:11.250 --> 00:42:14.370
Leave your scroll bar and
other browser elements alone.

00:42:16.880 --> 00:42:21.370
So the website that
does this the most.

00:42:23.850 --> 00:42:24.900
One of these pages has it.

00:42:24.900 --> 00:42:27.960
Of course I can not
remember which page it was.

00:42:37.730 --> 00:42:38.730
Here it is.

00:42:39.140 --> 00:42:45.662
This page on patch stack
has this super narrow bar

00:42:45.662 --> 00:42:47.040
on the right hand side.

00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:50.630
So one,
it is extremely difficult to see.

00:42:50.630 --> 00:42:53.950
And two, it is impossible to grab.

00:42:53.950 --> 00:42:56.460
You cannot grab this with a mouse.

00:42:56.460 --> 00:43:00.920
And as you have probably
noticed, I do a lot of grabbing.

00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:05.950
So I really happen to hate that.

00:43:07.030 --> 00:43:10.090
So basically leave the
browser elements alone.

00:43:10.090 --> 00:43:13.790
People are used to them,
people like them, they do not like it

00:43:13.790 --> 00:43:17.160
when someone walks over to their desk
and basically rearranges everything

00:43:17.160 --> 00:43:17.930
on them.

00:43:17.930 --> 00:43:21.320
And that's what changing your browser
is essentially doing to people.

00:43:22.570 --> 00:43:24.610
Avoid using any preloaders.

00:43:24.610 --> 00:43:28.550
There's a bunch of themes which come
with those splash display screens

00:43:28.550 --> 00:43:29.550
before they load.

00:43:30.430 --> 00:43:34.340
They are really annoying and can
cause a lot of issues for people

00:43:34.340 --> 00:43:38.060
with vestibular disorders or
people who just have a headache.

00:43:39.210 --> 00:43:41.230
Do not animate things.

00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:46.960
This is an example of a website
that animates something.

00:43:46.960 --> 00:43:50.180
When I hover my mouse,
the link bounces.

00:43:51.880 --> 00:43:55.620
Now, this is not good for
people who have motion issues

00:43:55.620 --> 00:43:57.910
and it's also just not
good for readability.

00:44:01.470 --> 00:44:04.370
At the bottom of the screen,
it does something even worse.

00:44:04.370 --> 00:44:08.370
It literally shakes the link
so you can not read it easily.

00:44:14.270 --> 00:44:17.140
Do not follow the mouse around.

00:44:17.140 --> 00:44:21.430
I have seen a few different
websites where when I drag my mouse

00:44:21.430 --> 00:44:26.260
and I tend to mouse all over
the place, when I drag my mouse,

00:44:26.260 --> 00:44:29.090
they have an effect
of stars following me.

00:44:30.200 --> 00:44:33.450
That is so incredibly annoying.

00:44:33.450 --> 00:44:36.220
Please leave my
computer elements alone.

00:44:37.950 --> 00:44:39.350
Avoid using infinite scroll.

00:44:40.470 --> 00:44:45.100
A lot of people use the footer
to access quick links or things

00:44:45.100 --> 00:44:46.230
within a website.

00:44:46.230 --> 00:44:49.390
When you have infinite scroll,
there is no website footer.

00:44:49.390 --> 00:44:50.390
You cannot reach it.

00:44:51.350 --> 00:44:54.580
Infinite scroll can also be a
problem for a lot of people trying

00:44:54.580 --> 00:44:56.920
to use screen readers
and keyboard navigation.

00:44:58.810 --> 00:45:01.510
Avoid smooth scroll
and hyper scroll.

00:45:01.510 --> 00:45:07.300
As I showed previously
with the focus not moving,

00:45:07.300 --> 00:45:11.320
when you use smooth scroll,
you usually screw up the focus.

00:45:12.580 --> 00:45:15.460
I mean at least nine
times out of ten

00:45:15.460 --> 00:45:19.120
when a JavaScript implementer
does smooth scroll,

00:45:19.121 --> 00:45:20.950
they screw up the focus.

00:45:20.950 --> 00:45:22.560
Also avoid using hyper scroll.

00:45:23.700 --> 00:45:28.150
For example, here I grab my
scroll bar and I scroll down.

00:45:30.250 --> 00:45:32.790
This is the expected behavior.

00:45:32.790 --> 00:45:36.090
When I come over here on the
Divi page, I grab my scroll bar

00:45:36.090 --> 00:45:43.390
and I scroll down and it's actually
moving at a slightly different rate.

00:45:44.530 --> 00:45:48.920
Divi includes a setting to totally
screw up the rate of a scroll bar.

00:45:50.030 --> 00:45:52.850
Drives me nuts and
many other people.

00:45:55.380 --> 00:45:57.510
Now I always get asked
what about theme builders?

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:03.630
In general, theme builders are
not tested for accessibility

00:46:03.630 --> 00:46:09.350
and they are pushed
for fancy features.

00:46:09.350 --> 00:46:13.740
Those features almost always
create accessibility barriers.

00:46:13.740 --> 00:46:19.160
Many of those are unusable menus,
problems with the search options.

00:46:19.160 --> 00:46:22.490
Some of them create completely
inaccessible sections

00:46:22.490 --> 00:46:25.140
where you can not even
get to the content.

00:46:25.140 --> 00:46:28.380
They will frequently create jump
links that do not move their context.

00:46:29.450 --> 00:46:32.920
They frequently get the
heading orders all wrong

00:46:32.920 --> 00:46:36.920
and a lot of them will actually
inject lots of inline styling.

00:46:38.010 --> 00:46:42.640
Inline styling is really not your
friend, especially if you have

00:46:42.640 --> 00:46:44.680
to maintain this
website in the future.

00:46:45.890 --> 00:46:49.410
The online styling is one of
the biggest headaches for trying

00:46:49.410 --> 00:46:51.780
to update a website to a new look.

00:46:54.006 --> 00:46:56.080
JASON: Hey, Gen,
I'm going to pause you right there

00:46:56.080 --> 00:46:59.530
just for just for
considerations of time.

00:46:59.530 --> 00:47:04.280
We have four three minutes left,
so if you could just wrap up

00:47:04.280 --> 00:47:07.090
and then we can finish
up the session on time.

00:47:08.137 --> 00:47:09.267
 GEN: Yes.

00:47:09.280 --> 00:47:09.700
JASON: Thank you.

00:47:11.010 --> 00:47:16.900
GEN: So, quickly about my theme,
then I started building this

00:47:16.900 --> 00:47:20.290
for rapid development from
Photoshop to WordPress.

00:47:20.290 --> 00:47:22.510
And I got tired of
fighting other themes

00:47:22.510 --> 00:47:24.020
so I just developed
my own solution.

00:47:25.890 --> 00:47:28.896
I started adding a
lot of accessibility

00:47:28.897 --> 00:47:31.000
to Kaya in October of 2021.

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:35.760
I did a major push, encouraging
the accessibility statements

00:47:35.760 --> 00:47:38.180
using font sizing and the
REM so that it can easily

00:47:38.180 --> 00:47:42.320
be updated and controlled by the
user, adding in focus states,

00:47:42.320 --> 00:47:46.680
removed redundant Aria and
a number of other options.

00:47:47.760 --> 00:47:51.630
Also added screen reader text,
underlined links in the body,

00:47:52.690 --> 00:47:55.840
and people can get
the slides later.

00:47:57.300 --> 00:48:00.570
Important thing I want to
talk about quickly is classes.

00:48:00.570 --> 00:48:02.873
When you use classes
on your elements,

00:48:02.874 --> 00:48:04.880
it makes it very future-friendly.

00:48:04.880 --> 00:48:09.780
For example, adding screen reader
text, white text, large text,

00:48:09.780 --> 00:48:13.870
this allows you to later
update that large text globally

00:48:13.870 --> 00:48:17.090
by just changing the CSS and
not having to go into each

00:48:17.090 --> 00:48:18.580
and every page and make updates.

00:48:20.840 --> 00:48:25.050
And also adding a lot of things
like margins and paddings

00:48:25.050 --> 00:48:28.340
and having these as quickly
accessible CSS classes

00:48:28.340 --> 00:48:30.434
so that you can make
really easy tweaks

00:48:30.435 --> 00:48:32.110
when you are building up pages.

00:48:33.750 --> 00:48:35.750
And I was going to do a demo,
but really do not have time for that.

00:48:38.220 --> 00:48:39.590
All right, Jason, I have wrapped.

00:48:41.060 --> 00:48:42.690
 JASON: OK,
thank you very much, Gen.

00:48:42.690 --> 00:48:43.980
That was really great.

00:48:45.110 --> 00:48:48.540
For those of you in attendance,
I see a bunch of questions came in.

00:48:48.540 --> 00:48:52.010
I know we are not going to have
time to get to those questions,

00:48:52.010 --> 00:48:55.090
but Gen will be sending
the questions off to you.

00:48:55.090 --> 00:48:57.720
So you will have them,
and you can always reach out

00:48:57.720 --> 00:48:59.750
to the individuals who
ask those questions.

00:49:01.970 --> 00:49:02.310
 GEN: All right.

00:49:02.310 --> 00:49:06.600
JASON: OK, well, thank you all
for attending today's session

00:49:06.600 --> 00:49:08.080
with Gen Herres.

00:49:08.080 --> 00:49:10.700
I think I got that right.

00:49:10.700 --> 00:49:13.410
And you can continue the
conversation in the chat

00:49:13.410 --> 00:49:21.410
or on social media using the
#WPA11YDAY and #WPAD2023.

00:49:22.880 --> 00:49:25.410
We would also
appreciate it if you go

00:49:25.410 --> 00:49:32.780
