AMBER HINDS: WordPress
Accessibility Day 2023.

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:08.440
Creating an Animation
Pause Button in WordPress,

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:10.840
with Speaker Danielle Zarcaro.

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:14.410
Founder,
Overnight Website by Kinetic Iris.

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:18.400
This presentation was
recorded September 28, 2023.

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:21.240
RONAK GANATRA: OK.

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.240
Hello, everyone.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.140
So welcome to the WP
Accessibility Day 2023.

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.870
And [Inaudible 00:00:32]

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:34.760
next session is about Creating an
Animation Pause Button in WordPress.

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.640
This session will be
hosted by Danielle.

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:46.800
Danielle Zarcaro is the Founder of
overnight website by Kinetic Iris.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.780
And they are from
the United States.

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:55.890
Danielle Zarcaro is the non-binary
Founder of Overnight Website

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:56.760
by Kinetic Iris.

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.900
They have been developing and
maintaining custom WordPress website

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.270
for over a decade.

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:05.160
They get excited every time there
is an object to tinker with,

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.280
or a puzzle to put together.

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.640
[Inaudible 00:01:07]

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.720
and there is nothing better than
putting [Inaudible 00:01:13]

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.930
or hot chocolate in their cups
just to put smile on their face.

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:20.589
[Inaudible 00:01:18]

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:21.850
in time for the sunset.

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.359
The stage is yours, Danielle.

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:29.690
Thank you.

00:01:36.507 --> 00:01:37.047
DANIELLE ZARCARO: OK.

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:40.510
So thank you so much.

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:45.350
Before we start, just quickly at the
top of each of my slides are going

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:50.050
to be my handle where you
can find me on most places.

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:55.270
And that's at QueerDevPerson.
And then you'll find the link

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:01.980
to the slides, which is
overnightwebsite.com/WPA11Yday.

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:06.600
And then the hashtag is on the
right, WPA11Yday again.

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.698
So first, a quote from the
illustrious Dr. Ian Malcolm

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:16.300
of Jurassic Park.

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.840
"Your scientists were
so preoccupied with

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.710
whether or not they could, they
didn't stop to think if they should".

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.090
I am not a voice actor.

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:32.240
Otherwise, I would try to give
more of a Dr. Ian Malcolm voice,

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.810
tone, but he is quite unique.

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.360
So whether you consider yourself
on the science side of things,

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.500
or the art side of things,
maybe the admin side of things,

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.530
we should all be asking
ourselves why we do things.

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.829
Digging deeper into
each choice we make

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:52.840
about what we put on our websites.

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.720
And as we ask ourselves these
questions, we also ask ourselves

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.300
if something we're doing
can cause issues for someone

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:03.640
when they want to use the site.

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.650
That's the first step in
answering the, Should we do this

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.020
or why are we doing this question.

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:12.560
For a lot of accessibility issues,
things that create a barrier

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.760
to using our sites, it's a matter
of fixing the issue, right?

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.430
Inaccessible navigation gets fixed.

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:20.510
Alt text gets added to images.

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:21.860
Heading order is addressed.

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.190
Captions added to videos.

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:26.370
Color contrast improved.

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.580
Then there are things that have
a broader range of options,

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:32.970
things that can be seen as annoying,
that you're adding to the page.

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:34.490
Optional things.

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:37.620
So the first thing to consider
when adding something to a site,

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:41.620
and I argue this question is
worth asking for a large amount

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.810
of things that can get added
to a site, Is this necessary?

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:48.155
Can this be done in a
way that doesn't need

00:03:48.156 --> 00:03:50.961
an entirely separate
control or configuration?

00:03:50.962 --> 00:03:54.560
It's making sure there's a reason
for what you're doing.

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.530
In this case, our question is,
are the animations necessary?

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:01.400
Can we use images to
achieve the same thing?

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:06.340
Can someone get the same feeling from
some other method besides motion?

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:10.030
In my case,
I had created my new agency website;

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:13.510
and while I could have kept it
to pretty much almost all text,

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:17.190
I knew I wanted to add
something to break it up.

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:20.210
The options are sort of
limitless in this case, right?

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:24.690
Use a lot of color, and image,
and icon, background image

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:27.760
with a gradient,
something to give the eyes a break,

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:30.780
reinforce the text,
and give a little bit of feeling.

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:34.180
For Kinetic Iris,
we're a development studio.

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.570
A lot of what we do does
not have the type of visuals

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:40.730
that you would put on a page
that's enticing to the audience.

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:42.980
It's just a bunch of code, right?

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:44.780
Maybe some site examples.

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:48.960
I didn't want to crawl through
hundreds of stock photos.

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.360
I didn't want to go completely
in the opposite direction

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.710
of simple icons or SVGs.

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:55.050
I wanted it dynamic.

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:57.970
The company name has
the word Kinetic in it.

00:04:57.970 --> 00:04:59.280
I wanted motion.

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:01.920
And it gives a little bit
more of that interactive field

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:04.360
to reinforce the custom
development side of things.

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:09.860
In regards to the bigger
question of generally,

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:13.650
is this something you just
want to throw on the site

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:14.830
because you think it looks neat?

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:18.360
Is it something that
actually enhances the site?

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:21.350
Is there a different way you
can convey this information

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:26.220
or brand-feel without adding
a perpetually moving image?

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:30.880
If it's a slider, ask if it's
actually doing what you want it to.

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:33.750
Can this information be conveyed
in a more user-friendly way

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:36.610
that's more engaging
without having to also add

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:39.280
all that extra required
interaction to it?

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:44.910
In my case, the answer was,
Yes, proceed with the animation.

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:48.570
So once we've answered the
should I question, that's

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:52.022
when you start to
explore the requirements

00:05:52.023 --> 00:05:54.110
that you have to satisfy,

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:56.010
and the reasons behind
those requirements.

00:05:56.010 --> 00:06:00.400
What are the issues that people
could have with motion and animation,

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:03.500
and what can we do to
help them use our site?

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:06.930
As it says on the slide here,
animations can present a variety

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:09.610
of barriers or issues
for website visitors.

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:12.600
We want to provide a way that
respects their initial settings

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:15.260
and then lets them decide
how they want to proceed.

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:18.720
So this is our mission
statement for our animation.

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:21.290
We'd be respecting the
reduced-motion options

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:24.820
and then giving them the option
to then completely stop animations

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:26.420
and movement altogether.

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:29.520
This falls under four success
criterion outlined here,

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:32.250
depending on the type of
animation that you're adding.

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:35.870
You have 2.2.2,
which is pause, stop, hide.

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:38.180
That's A level requirement.

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:42.340
It's about information that's on the
page for longer than five seconds,

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:46.560
so that when it gets paused,
any sliders won't auto play.

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:50.550
You can implement a more
subtle transition than a slide,

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:52.260
like a fade, for instance.

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:57.330
Switch out those fancy new marquees
that have been popping up now

00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:59.450
as the latest trend.

00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:02.530
Create a non-moving
text banner instead.

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:05.890
Pause the circle that's
going around constantly.

00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:08.590
This is for people who
can't read quickly.

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:12.170
For automatically moving text,
which can provide problems

00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:17.200
for screen readers, it provides
severe distraction, which interferes

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:20.430
with the ability to concentrate
on other parts of the page.

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:23.521
It can cause nausea,
dizziness, headaches

00:07:23.522 --> 00:07:25.950
if scrolling page elements move.

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:28.970
It can trigger the vestibular
or inner ear disorders.

00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:32.760
Flashing or blinking can cause
seizures due to photosensitivity.

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:34.990
There's a lot of things here that
people could have problems with

00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:37.800
when it comes to
motion and animation.

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:39.230
There's also three other ones.

00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:41.370
There's 2.3.1.

00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:45.520
Three flashes are below
threshold, and that's A level.

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:48.600
Then there's the AAA level,
which is just three flashes.

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:50.750
That's 2.3.2.

00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:57.140
Then you have the .31, which is
the animation from interaction,

00:07:57.140 --> 00:07:58.700
which is also AAA.

00:07:59.730 --> 00:08:03.260
So just as a quick differentiation,
pause, stop, hide is

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:07.280
when the page loads and
initiates the animation.

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:10.480
So content loading, page
loading, anything like that.

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:13.680
Animation from interaction is the
user initiating the interaction

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:15.350
like hover or scrolling.

00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:19.820
And how you handle the A level
is pretty much how you handle

00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:23.540
and address the AAA level,
which is all for a way to pause

00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:25.460
and respect user preferences.

00:08:27.090 --> 00:08:30.510
Some of our options to
address these would be

00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:34.030
to just remove page
load, scroll features,

00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:37.190
stick a pause button
under each animation.

00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:40.900
But we want to make
this as easy as possible

00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:43.840
while still giving a fun
experience, right?

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:46.880
We don't want them to have to
pause every single animation

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:50.600
by having a toggle button
at the top of the page.

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:53.090
We give someone the ability
to control that animation

00:08:53.090 --> 00:08:56.930
before they get there, rather
than having to be exposed to it

00:08:56.930 --> 00:08:57.930
and then pause it.

00:08:59.830 --> 00:09:02.840
There’s a media query that
I'll refer to as we go,

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:05.460
prefers-reduced-motion,
that we're going look at.

00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:07.360
But that means reduced
motion, right?

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:10.050
You don't have to just
remove all animation totally.

00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:15.090
You provide a pared-down
experience in terms of movement.

00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:19.350
So we can use that and respect
it, and then give people a way

00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:23.130
to control the animation that
maybe don't want to set it

00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:24.450
on their computers.

00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:26.670
Maybe they want to
temporarily pause it.

00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:28.510
So we're offering options here.

00:09:28.510 --> 00:09:30.450
I also kind of like the
idea of giving someone

00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:35.900
who turned on reduced motion to
allow the website to show the motion

00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:36.700
if they wanted.

00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:39.630
I sometimes turn it on and
off based on my own needs

00:09:39.630 --> 00:09:44.610
regarding overstimulation, eye
strain, depending on what the type

00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:46.800
of animation is,
it'll make me a little bit dizzy.

00:09:48.430 --> 00:09:50.860
How great would it be if
I had an option on a site

00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:53.600
that let me decide what I
wanted to do in that moment?

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:57.330
I think this is kind of where
those accessibility overlays,

00:09:57.330 --> 00:10:01.280
their intention hopefully came
from, which is to allow users

00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:03.980
to control things on a site
without having to set it

00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:07.130
on their computer settings,
but they haven't done it in a way

00:10:07.130 --> 00:10:11.240
that's accessible, and they create
more problems than they solve.

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:14.250
So what we're doing is targeting
a very specific situation

00:10:14.250 --> 00:10:17.740
that directly applies to our
website, and ensuring that it works

00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:18.870
for our site.

00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:20.908
We're not providing
100 different options

00:10:20.909 --> 00:10:22.510
that somebody has to go through.

00:10:22.510 --> 00:10:23.960
We're providing this
one thing that's going

00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:26.550
to enhance the user's experience.

00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:29.240
A big part of this is
making the right decisions.

00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:31.810
If an animation is going to blink,
it's going to be distracting,

00:10:31.810 --> 00:10:34.090
if it's going to be
a problem for someone

00:10:34.090 --> 00:10:37.770
before they can even find the
pause button, don't do it.

00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:40.770
Just because you can add a button to
a site doesn't give you permission

00:10:40.770 --> 00:10:42.530
to now do whatever you want.

00:10:42.530 --> 00:10:45.790
We're just thinking of a
better user experience here.

00:10:45.790 --> 00:10:48.210
So with that, here's what
we're going to be building.

00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:55.450
It's a button that controls an
animation play or pause state.

00:10:55.450 --> 00:11:00.210
It should default to the user's
preferences and save the state

00:11:00.210 --> 00:11:02.080
of the button across pages.

00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:05.290
It should be accessible to
people using a mouse, a keyboard,

00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:06.200
or a screen reader.

00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:09.160
So that's our project summary here.

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:10.280
We had our mission statement.

00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:12.840
Now we've got a summary
of what we're doing.

00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:15.820
I'm going to have a
link show up here.

00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:23.080
It's
github.com/queeredevperson/animation-toggle.

00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:26.850
That's going to get you the code
that we're going to go over.

00:11:26.850 --> 00:11:30.710
It's also again on the slide
link that I have at the top,

00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:35.770
overnightwebsite.com/WPA11yday.
That link is going to be

00:11:35.770 --> 00:11:37.030
on that webpage as well.

00:11:39.430 --> 00:11:43.520
So we exit out of
this really quickly.

00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:46.800
The read me on the GitHub
just gives you an overview

00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:48.420
of the different
files that are there.

00:11:50.170 --> 00:11:58.170
And then if we take a quick look
at, for instance, functions,

00:11:58.340 --> 00:12:03.600
toggle, style, there's different
files here with the idea

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:05.870
that you would add this to a theme.

00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:11.560
I'll go over some future plans for
this at the end of the presentation.

00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:16.480
But basically, this is kind of to
give you an idea of what to do,

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:20.020
just so that we had our
eyes on it for a minute.

00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:25.150
There's always multiple
ways to do things.

00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:29.460
So back in the slideshow here,
we want to research our options,

00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:31.420
pick the best one.

00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:34.700
Luckily for us, a lot of smart
people have tested out our options.

00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:36.970
We can go through that
and gather that research,

00:12:36.970 --> 00:12:38.590
and give ourselves a
really nice starting point.

00:12:38.590 --> 00:12:40.250
You don't need to
start from scratch.

00:12:40.250 --> 00:12:43.570
I looked around at examples
of accessible toggle buttons.

00:12:43.570 --> 00:12:46.440
Read why people created
things in certain ways.

00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:49.710
What would most closely resemble
what I was trying to do.

00:12:49.710 --> 00:12:53.250
I definitely wanted it to look
like the toggle button you'd find

00:12:53.250 --> 00:12:54.850
on an iPhone.

00:12:54.850 --> 00:12:57.620
That seems to be the most
common pattern you find.

00:12:58.835 --> 00:13:01.240
I have a few examples
up on the slide.

00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:04.550
We have some Google Calendar
settings examples in the top left.

00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:07.460
It's got two options,
one's on and one's off.

00:13:07.460 --> 00:13:09.630
They give you different options
to show the week number,

00:13:09.630 --> 00:13:10.960
show decline events.

00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:13.690
So it's like a group of options
with these toggle buttons over

00:13:13.690 --> 00:13:14.660
on the right.

00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:18.460
And the circle in direction
on the left or right

00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:23.090
in the background color both
indicate whether it's on or off.

00:13:23.090 --> 00:13:26.560
Below that, we have the Apple
iPhone settings, different color,

00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:27.990
but same principle.

00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:31.410
They handle their labels a
little differently in terms of

00:13:32.430 --> 00:13:34.190
how to word these things.

00:13:34.190 --> 00:13:37.660
So that's another
barrier to get through.

00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:40.435
The example on the
right is a screenshot

00:13:40.436 --> 00:13:42.330
of three different options.

00:13:42.330 --> 00:13:46.430
You have a similar pattern,
but with the words on and off

00:13:46.430 --> 00:13:50.440
to sort of additionally indicate
which one is actually on

00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:53.160
or off so that you
don't have to guess.

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:56.350
You have an option below that where
it's sort of like a button shape

00:13:56.350 --> 00:13:59.090
that's split in half,
and the background color indicates

00:13:59.090 --> 00:14:00.430
whether it's on or off.

00:14:00.430 --> 00:14:04.180
I personally really hate this
option because I can never decide

00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:05.380
which ones right or wrong.

00:14:05.380 --> 00:14:08.920
And honestly, I kind of click it
three or four times just to be sure

00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:10.960
that I put it in the right place.

00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:13.650
So that one I knew I
wanted to stay away from.

00:14:13.650 --> 00:14:15.780
The one on the bottom is
probably how you would go

00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:19.450
about doing a background color
indicator, where you sort

00:14:19.450 --> 00:14:23.820
of have this background color,
then you have a background color

00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:28.100
that's different on your options,
then you have a background color

00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:30.930
on the selected option, and they
all have padding around them.

00:14:30.930 --> 00:14:33.270
It's a little bit clearer,
and this is really good

00:14:33.270 --> 00:14:34.650
for more than two options.

00:14:34.650 --> 00:14:37.750
So I kind of knew I wanted
to stick with the toggle.

00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:42.170
So what we're going to
be doing in terms of...

00:14:42.170 --> 00:14:44.730
I'll give one more slide here.

00:14:44.730 --> 00:14:45.730
Sorry.

00:14:47.870 --> 00:14:50.840
So when we look at our code,
starting with the HTML,

00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:53.990
because where else do you start
but the bones of your site,

00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:56.140
we know that we're going
to add a body class.

00:14:56.140 --> 00:15:00.460
And we do this because
targeting that class in our CSS

00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:05.110
and in our JavaScript is
going to be really helpful.

00:15:05.110 --> 00:15:10.000
And it's just good to know, overall,
are we animating or are we not.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:14.880
So it's sort of this point of truth
almost at the top of the document.

00:15:17.130 --> 00:15:20.570
As far as the HTML element to
use, technically,

00:15:20.570 --> 00:15:24.270
there are multiple elements that
we could use to create the action

00:15:24.270 --> 00:15:25.790
of toggling.

00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:29.240
It's pretty much a button or
checkbox, are really the ones

00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:30.620
that it comes down to.

00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:34.050
The checkbox isn't going to give us
all of the features we're looking for

00:15:34.050 --> 00:15:38.270
when it comes to styling,
accessibility, semantics.

00:15:38.270 --> 00:15:43.150
At the end of the slide show,
the second to last slide has links.

00:15:43.150 --> 00:15:45.570
So it's got, I think,
four links in it.

00:15:45.570 --> 00:15:48.740
So the first link is going to
go into a good breakdown of

00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:50.490
why to use a button.

00:15:50.490 --> 00:15:52.730
It's the Adrian Roselli link.

00:15:52.730 --> 00:15:55.820
And that was actually where I was
able to get a good starting point

00:15:55.820 --> 00:15:58.160
for my toggle button styles, too.

00:15:58.160 --> 00:15:59.820
In our case, it's a button.

00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:01.850
Buttons do something
when they're pushed.

00:16:01.850 --> 00:16:03.780
That's what we're going for.

00:16:03.780 --> 00:16:06.670
We have one thing that
we're turning on and off,

00:16:06.670 --> 00:16:10.040
and our one button is going to have
two states that we're working with.

00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:13.020
So technically, you could have
two buttons, but in our case,

00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:15.140
it adds unnecessary complexity.

00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:17.640
We're never going to
have more than on or off,

00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:21.760
so there's no need to account for
a possible future third option.

00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:25.130
We're going to be indicating these
two states that we're working with

00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:31.570
through our JavaScripts, and then
through a screen reader attribute

00:16:31.570 --> 00:16:33.890
using ARIA-pressed.

00:16:33.890 --> 00:16:37.590
It's going to default to false,
because if JavaScript isn't loaded,

00:16:37.590 --> 00:16:39.490
the animations aren't running.

00:16:39.490 --> 00:16:43.300
So we want it to be off, and then
use our JavaScript to turn it on

00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:44.910
if somebody interacts with it.

00:16:44.910 --> 00:16:46.720
We're using this
through ARIA-pressed.

00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:48.910
Technically, again,
There are two options here.

00:16:48.910 --> 00:16:51.300
There's ARIA-checked
and ARIA-pressed.

00:16:51.300 --> 00:16:54.670
I went into a pretty deep dive
into this to try to figure out

00:16:54.670 --> 00:16:56.480
what the differences were.

00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:59.910
ARIA-checked basically turns
the button into a checkbox,

00:16:59.910 --> 00:17:03.210
which isn't quite the intended
behavior that we want.

00:17:03.210 --> 00:17:07.840
It's not reliably read out
across all screen readers.

00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:09.940
It can often end up with
unpredictable behavior.

00:17:09.940 --> 00:17:13.960
So ARIA pressed it is,
and that's what we're going to use

00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:17.670
to target again in our
CSS and JavaScript.

00:17:17.670 --> 00:17:19.760
We have to think about what
the button text should be,

00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:23.940
much like those examples that I
showed that have Google using,

00:17:23.940 --> 00:17:26.720
like, show this option,
and then you say, yes or no.

00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:29.280
And then Apple sort of goes a
little bit more general sometimes

00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:32.810
and says, like, Here's this
option; do you want it or not?

00:17:32.810 --> 00:17:35.120
So do we say play animations?

00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:36.560
Do we say animations?

00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:44.560
How do we have you label that?

00:17:44.990 --> 00:17:48.110
We have the option to
add icons in there,

00:17:48.110 --> 00:17:50.040
kind of like that
on and off example.

00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:53.590
So these status indicators,
whether it's words, icons,

00:17:53.590 --> 00:17:55.560
we use ARIA-hidden to hide those.

00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:57.505
When I tested it using
my screen reader,

00:17:57.506 --> 00:17:59.070
it actually didn't read them out

00:17:59.070 --> 00:18:00.790
when I didn't have
ARIA-hidden on there.

00:18:00.790 --> 00:18:03.650
But you can't be sure that that's
always going to be the case,

00:18:03.650 --> 00:18:07.160
and so to be safe,
you hide those definitely.

00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:08.830
So ARIA hidden equals true.

00:18:09.850 --> 00:18:13.540
In terms of the animations
themselves, there were a few things

00:18:13.540 --> 00:18:15.300
on my list that I wanted to try.

00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:18.420
I could always use more
practice with CSS animations.

00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:20.680
I want to dive deeper
into animating SVGs,

00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:22.850
but I had heard
about Lottie images.

00:18:22.850 --> 00:18:27.570
And even though... So my first
instinct was to go the other route

00:18:27.570 --> 00:18:30.040
because I hate loading extra
stuff when I don't have to,

00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:34.060
but this could be a really good
way to streamline the process.

00:18:34.060 --> 00:18:36.070
And so this gave me the
opportunity to look into that,

00:18:36.070 --> 00:18:37.390
so that's what we're using today.

00:18:37.390 --> 00:18:42.280
There is a Lottie WordPress
plugin, that's L-O-T-T-I-E.

00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:45.070
It lets you embed things right
on the page, give you the options

00:18:45.070 --> 00:18:48.600
for playing and pausing, but it
doesn’t give you full control.

00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:51.650
And because we're adding more
than one to a page, and I want

00:18:51.650 --> 00:18:56.040
to do some very specific things,
it's easiest to manually add each

00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:57.140
of these things to the page.

00:18:58.870 --> 00:19:02.450
So if we go out of this
slideshow again and head over

00:19:02.450 --> 00:19:05.440
to our code,
we're going to look really quickly

00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:07.740
through this functions.php file.

00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:11.170
Basically, what we're doing
in here are two things.

00:19:11.170 --> 00:19:13.730
First is loading in our
scripts and our styles.

00:19:13.730 --> 00:19:15.780
We have a general style sheet.

00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:18.910
You can stick these things
in a dedicated style sheet.

00:19:18.910 --> 00:19:22.070
However you handle your styles,
we got to get them in here.

00:19:22.070 --> 00:19:24.870
Then we have two Lottie scripts.

00:19:24.870 --> 00:19:27.660
So we have the first one,
which is the general player.

00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:31.620
There we have one...
I have two ways that the things are

00:19:31.620 --> 00:19:33.350
being animated through
Lottie scripts.

00:19:33.350 --> 00:19:36.550
Now, I've toggled over
to my Kinetic Iris site.

00:19:36.550 --> 00:19:41.050
I have the animations turned
on, and we have one that sort

00:19:41.050 --> 00:19:42.940
of plays perpetually.

00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:47.920
It's a couple of floating computer,
and mug, and something's happening

00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:49.180
on the computer screen.

00:19:49.180 --> 00:19:55.270
Now we have two that are
like wireframe type mockups.

00:19:55.270 --> 00:19:58.830
One is of like a hero area,
and one is of a whole site,

00:19:58.830 --> 00:20:01.720
and they animate on scroll.

00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:04.620
In order to do that
animate-on-scroll stuff, we load

00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:07.400
in this Lottie interactive script.

00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:11.300
Then finally,
we add in our JavaScript file.

00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:14.240
Again, however you handle your
assets, it could be in its own file,

00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:17.890
it could be in a main script
file, however you want to do it,

00:20:17.890 --> 00:20:19.690
add those into the site.

00:20:19.690 --> 00:20:21.030
Then the second thing
that we're doing

00:20:21.030 --> 00:20:23.900
in our functions file is
adding that body class.

00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:29.200
Again, we're starting with
no animation happening.

00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:33.290
So all we're going to do is
add in the no animation class

00:20:33.290 --> 00:20:38.290
onto the body and then toggling
that through our JavaScript.

00:20:38.290 --> 00:20:40.590
So that's all that's happening
in this functions file.

00:20:40.590 --> 00:20:44.430
If we head over to our HTML
file, I've included the body tag

00:20:44.430 --> 00:20:48.670
just for a complete view of
what this would look like.

00:20:48.670 --> 00:20:52.300
This would theoretically be
included either dynamically

00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:57.580
through a full site editing theme,
or manually through a header file

00:20:57.580 --> 00:20:59.190
in a classic theme.

00:20:59.190 --> 00:21:01.950
And then it would,
through our functions file,

00:21:01.950 --> 00:21:03.270
add in that no animation class.

00:21:03.270 --> 00:21:06.760
But I'm adding it here just for
a complete view of the HTML.

00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:09.850
Now, the way that I'm adding
this to my theme right now is

00:21:09.850 --> 00:21:11.750
through just custom HTML blocks.

00:21:11.750 --> 00:21:16.360
And what that allows me
to do is handle everything

00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:19.300
through the traditional
full site editing,

00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:23.040
through the traditional page
templates with the block editor.

00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:25.410
And I can just stick
in what I need.

00:21:25.410 --> 00:21:28.430
Now, again, I'll go over a better
way that I plan on doing this

00:21:28.430 --> 00:21:28.890
in the future.

00:21:28.890 --> 00:21:33.060
But for now, it's really nice because
at some point, I can swap this in

00:21:33.060 --> 00:21:35.620
for a custom block,
I can do whatever I need to,

00:21:35.620 --> 00:21:39.330
I don't have to create some
kind of custom header template,

00:21:39.330 --> 00:21:40.410
I don't have to do anything.

00:21:40.410 --> 00:21:44.740
Everything is still within this
sort of bigger WordPress ecosystem.

00:21:44.740 --> 00:21:48.260
And then in this tiny area,
I'm sticking my custom HTML.

00:21:48.260 --> 00:21:52.340
So I've basically extracted that and
stuck that in this HTML file for you.

00:21:52.340 --> 00:21:57.520
We're wrapping our toggle
button in a toggles wrapper div.

00:21:57.520 --> 00:22:03.000
And then we have our actual toggle
button element, again, with an ID.

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:04.940
We've called it animation
controls, and we're going

00:22:04.940 --> 00:22:07.040
to use our JavaScript
to target that.

00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:10.790
And then we're using ARIA-pressed
equals false, again, to default,

00:22:10.790 --> 00:22:12.200
to no animation.

00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:15.640
And then here,
I just have two icons.

00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:18.250
It's a span with
ARIA-hidden equals true.

00:22:18.250 --> 00:22:20.490
And then I just pasted
the SVG code in there.

00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:25.940
At the bottom of the HTML
file, I have the examples

00:22:25.940 --> 00:22:30.090
of the three animations
that I have on my homepage.

00:22:30.090 --> 00:22:33.730
And it's basically sort of the
same pattern with different values.

00:22:33.730 --> 00:22:39.160
I've added a div
class, Lottie wrapper,

00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:41.730
to contain my Lottie element.

00:22:42.890 --> 00:22:47.610
I've added the Lottie player element
with a different ID depending

00:22:47.610 --> 00:22:52.500
on the one that we're using; the
source file, which is basically

00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:56.720
just when you come over to
the Lottiefiles.com website,

00:22:59.230 --> 00:23:02.390
I have two examples here
of the two of the ones

00:23:02.390 --> 00:23:03.430
that I have on scroll.

00:23:03.430 --> 00:23:06.590
And basically,
you go here to this download button,

00:23:06.590 --> 00:23:09.380
you click on it and download
the Lottie JSON file,

00:23:09.380 --> 00:23:11.420
and then I just upload
that directly in.

00:23:11.420 --> 00:23:15.000
Again, you're going to want
to lock that down based on

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:18.760
who's using the site so
only trusted admins can use

00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:20.560
the JSON upload feature.

00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:26.510
But you ideally would enable a
JSON upload, or some other method,

00:23:26.510 --> 00:23:28.750
maybe it's on a Google
Drive somewhere.

00:23:28.750 --> 00:23:33.710
However, you want to add this
file, and then adding the width

00:23:33.710 --> 00:23:34.710
and the height.

00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:40.990
What I've done is I’ve basically
taken an SVG of one of the frames

00:23:40.990 --> 00:23:43.730
of the animation and added
that in a no-script tag.

00:23:43.730 --> 00:23:48.420
Because, again, when the JavaScript
is disabled, nothing loads at all.

00:23:48.420 --> 00:23:52.820
So if there's no scripts, I add
the SVG element with the alt text

00:23:52.820 --> 00:23:54.800
and the height and width.

00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:58.440
So that's basically the
overview of the HTML.

00:24:00.450 --> 00:24:02.640
We come back to our slideshow.

00:24:04.420 --> 00:24:06.760
We're going to go
over the CSS code.

00:24:07.790 --> 00:24:09.300
I'm calling out just a few things.

00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:13.390
We have two states, animations
playing, animations paused,

00:24:13.390 --> 00:24:14.680
so that's on and off.

00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:20.070
And then we have a focus and a hover
to test for both of those states.

00:24:20.070 --> 00:24:26.020
And then we're using the
ARIA-pressed attribute to target.

00:24:26.020 --> 00:24:30.590
And then I've added some
prefers-reduced-motion examples.

00:24:31.690 --> 00:24:34.990
So if we go back to our code
and we go to the style.css file

00:24:34.990 --> 00:24:40.180
that I've added... As I mentioned,
I have that Lottie player,

00:24:40.180 --> 00:24:43.210
I have the Lottie wrapper,
so I added some of those styles

00:24:43.210 --> 00:24:45.910
just to give it a
general conformity.

00:24:45.910 --> 00:24:48.460
Next, we go into our
main toggle styles.

00:24:48.460 --> 00:24:50.380
I'm not going to go
through each of these.

00:24:50.380 --> 00:24:53.240
You can read through
these if you want.

00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:58.320
But we're using the ARIA-pressed
attribute rather than some kind of ID

00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:02.190
or class because it helps us,
if we scroll down a little bit,

00:25:02.190 --> 00:25:06.150
to be able to use then the
ARIA-pressed true and false.

00:25:06.150 --> 00:25:09.780
And this way, we're sort of keeping
the specificity at a minimum,

00:25:10.810 --> 00:25:14.300
just for best practices’ sake.

00:25:14.300 --> 00:25:18.330
And then this way we, can sort
of visualize what we're doing

00:25:18.330 --> 00:25:22.650
by having ARIA-pressed with no
value, is just in general.

00:25:22.650 --> 00:25:25.040
And then ARIA-pressed with a
true value and a false value.

00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:27.860
So it's easier for us to visualize
what's going on in our CSS code.

00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:34.800
So then we're targeting
the play and pause icons.

00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:38.460
We have the background and the
circle that toggles back and forth.

00:25:40.430 --> 00:25:46.670
When the animations are on, that
means that ARIA-pressed equals true.

00:25:46.670 --> 00:25:49.290
So we're adding the
different colors to that.

00:25:49.290 --> 00:25:50.880
The animations are off.

00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:54.210
So we've adjusted the colors
for that, different opacities

00:25:54.210 --> 00:25:57.940
for different things, and then the
hover and focus states for those.

00:25:57.940 --> 00:26:00.800
So this is kind of a
straightforward style document

00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:03.030
in terms of what's going on.

00:26:03.030 --> 00:26:05.970
A couple of screen-size
adjustments for when it gets small.

00:26:05.970 --> 00:26:07.930
You don't want to go too
small, but just so that it fits

00:26:07.930 --> 00:26:08.930
in the header nicely.

00:26:10.740 --> 00:26:14.180
So my site doesn't have a ton of
animation beyond these Lottie files,

00:26:14.180 --> 00:26:18.630
but by setting up this thing at
the bottom, I have the only thing

00:26:18.630 --> 00:26:22.360
that plays no matter
what is the toggle.

00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:26.410
So if we click on this toggle
on the Kinetic Iris site,

00:26:26.410 --> 00:26:30.970
we can see this very subtle sort of
sliding action of back and forth.

00:26:30.970 --> 00:26:33.250
That's very minimal.

00:26:33.250 --> 00:26:38.230
And if you turn that animation on
and off based on their selection,

00:26:38.230 --> 00:26:45.750
it ends up in this stutter-y
experience where it animates on,

00:26:45.750 --> 00:26:49.480
but then slaps over to
off, so It's not ideal.

00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:53.670
So I felt that this was fine
to keep on at all times.

00:26:53.670 --> 00:26:57.030
Then everything else,
it's your preference, right?

00:26:57.030 --> 00:27:02.220
So you can code all of
your styles to align with

00:27:02.220 --> 00:27:06.580
when animations are off,
and then use the media queries

00:27:06.580 --> 00:27:10.800
and the animation class that we've
added to then add that transition

00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:17.480
into things, to add the different
motion to all the different elements.

00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:21.300
Or you can animate it and
code it and do whatever,

00:27:21.300 --> 00:27:25.840
and then use that media query
and class to turn that off.

00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:29.790
I really like to
default to nothing.

00:27:29.790 --> 00:27:33.020
And then when somebody's not
made the choice to reduce,

00:27:33.020 --> 00:27:37.740
or when somebody is explicitly
permitting you to have animations,

00:27:37.740 --> 00:27:39.540
that's when I turn them on.

00:27:39.540 --> 00:27:44.400
Because then we're ensuring good,
solid experience for everybody,

00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:48.740
and then giving that extra
umph for people who want it.

00:27:48.740 --> 00:27:52.180
That's my preference,
but I have the examples down here

00:27:52.180 --> 00:27:57.220
that you can use and play around
with, and then use that animation

00:27:57.220 --> 00:28:00.040
or no animation class accordingly.

00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:01.890
So If you wanted to
target no animation,

00:28:01.890 --> 00:28:05.590
you would just do no animation
instead of animation.

00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:10.470
So that's our style sheet.

00:28:10.470 --> 00:28:12.750
Again, pretty straightforward.

00:28:12.750 --> 00:28:15.910
The JavaScript is really where we're
going to get a little bit more fun

00:28:15.910 --> 00:28:16.910
with it.

00:28:18.450 --> 00:28:24.000
As an overview over on our slideshow,
we have the options to set,

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:28.340
get, and update our animation
status when we load the page

00:28:28.340 --> 00:28:29.670
and when they interact
with the button.

00:28:31.100 --> 00:28:34.093
We're going to use the
prefers-reduced-motion

00:28:34.094 --> 00:28:37.210
and a previous interaction
with the toggle button.

00:28:37.210 --> 00:28:40.790
And then we play or pause the
animations on load and interaction.

00:28:40.790 --> 00:28:44.300
So that's kind of the summary of
what our JavaScript file is going

00:28:44.300 --> 00:28:45.480
to be doing.

00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:50.510
So if we head over to our JavaScript
file... I've tried to comment

00:28:50.510 --> 00:28:52.210
as much as possible in these files.

00:28:52.210 --> 00:28:56.150
So it's going to be a lot
of comments, not too many.

00:28:56.150 --> 00:28:59.200
I tried to be diplomatic with it,
but give you enough information

00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:01.550
so you could at least
see what's going on.

00:29:01.550 --> 00:29:04.047
So basically,
once our page is loaded,

00:29:04.048 --> 00:29:06.160
we're going to get a few things.

00:29:07.180 --> 00:29:11.540
We're going to get the person's
reduced motion preference

00:29:11.540 --> 00:29:12.750
from their system settings.

00:29:13.850 --> 00:29:16.940
Then we're going to get the
status of the toggle button

00:29:16.940 --> 00:29:18.440
that's on the site.

00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:25.210
And again, if we had put our
HTML to the other side here,

00:29:25.210 --> 00:29:28.030
that's going to be
this toggle button.

00:29:28.030 --> 00:29:30.560
The button ID with
animation controls,

00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:32.710
that’s what we're going to get,
that status of that button.

00:29:34.530 --> 00:29:39.140
And then we are also going
to get the element itself

00:29:39.140 --> 00:29:41.240
so that we can interact with it.

00:29:41.240 --> 00:29:44.410
And then we're going to get the
different Lottie player elements

00:29:44.410 --> 00:29:45.600
that we have on the page.

00:29:47.110 --> 00:29:50.560
So those are the things that
we're getting in order to use

00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:52.550
to do these two things.

00:29:53.910 --> 00:29:59.360
First, we set an initial status
based on our user preferences

00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:01.860
if they haven't yet
come to the site.

00:30:01.860 --> 00:30:06.150
So if there's no
toggle element setting,

00:30:06.150 --> 00:30:09.710
that's because they haven't been here
before or interacted with the page.

00:30:09.710 --> 00:30:14.460
And so what we're going to do
is grab the person's preference

00:30:14.460 --> 00:30:16.150
and act accordingly.

00:30:16.150 --> 00:30:20.160
So if they don't have reduced
on, we're going to go ahead

00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:23.370
and set our local
storage that's going

00:30:23.370 --> 00:30:28.440
to help us track the user's
preference through our pages.

00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:31.010
We're going to set that to be play.

00:30:31.010 --> 00:30:33.040
And then we're going to call
our play animations function

00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:34.130
and go ahead and play everything.

00:30:35.290 --> 00:30:37.560
Otherwise, we're going to
have everything be paused.

00:30:37.560 --> 00:30:40.230
So we're going to set our
local storage item to pause

00:30:40.230 --> 00:30:41.700
and we're going to
pause animations.

00:30:43.180 --> 00:30:47.630
If they have come to the site before
and we do have an animation status,

00:30:47.630 --> 00:30:50.970
which is our status of the
toggle button on the site,

00:30:52.350 --> 00:30:55.390
we’re going to just
either play or pause.

00:30:55.390 --> 00:31:00.920
All of this logic that I've just
gone over is for on-page load.

00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:06.150
So when the page loads, we have to
figure out whether to play or pause.

00:31:06.150 --> 00:31:10.050
And then so what we do is, we see
if there's an animation status.

00:31:10.050 --> 00:31:13.200
If not, we play or pause
according to settings.

00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:15.370
If there is,
then we go ahead and play and pause

00:31:15.370 --> 00:31:17.440
according to their toggle options.

00:31:18.570 --> 00:31:22.160
Now, we have to do something when
they click the toggle button.

00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:25.950
So when they click it, we're
going to get that animation status

00:31:25.950 --> 00:31:31.390
that we've set from the page load
and we're going to hold on to that.

00:31:31.390 --> 00:31:35.590
We're going to check against that
if that equals play, we’re going

00:31:35.590 --> 00:31:37.340
to then do the opposite.

00:31:37.340 --> 00:31:39.820
Because what's going to happen?

00:31:39.820 --> 00:31:44.720
They're going to an element; say
that it's an element that's playing,

00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:45.160
right?

00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:50.170
If we go back to our website here,
our animations are toggled to on.

00:31:50.170 --> 00:31:54.560
Now, when I click this,
it currently equals play,

00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:57.360
and so now I have
to pause everything.

00:31:57.360 --> 00:32:01.300
So if it equals play,
we have to pause everything.

00:32:01.300 --> 00:32:03.290
If it equals pause,
we play everything.

00:32:03.290 --> 00:32:07.080
It's a little bit of Wait a minute,
but that's what we're doing.

00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:08.950
We're doing the opposite
of what they want

00:32:08.950 --> 00:32:11.270
because the current value
needs to be toggled.

00:32:12.610 --> 00:32:13.100
That's it.

00:32:13.100 --> 00:32:14.050
That's our logic.

00:32:14.050 --> 00:32:17.680
Now, we have two functions here,
the playing and the pausing.

00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:22.160
They're going to pretty much
mirror each other in terms of

00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:25.080
what they're doing, and then
just setting things opposite.

00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:29.820
So we set our value in
our local storage to play.

00:32:31.030 --> 00:32:33.350
This is the play
animations function.

00:32:33.350 --> 00:32:37.620
Then we set our new ARIA value
role to ARIA-pressed equals true.

00:32:37.620 --> 00:32:42.520
And so if I show my console
here, and if I click this,

00:32:42.520 --> 00:32:46.225
you can see that the button
ARIA-pressed equals true,

00:32:46.226 --> 00:32:49.280
equals false,
and that's what we're changing.

00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:52.990
And then you can also see the body
class changing as well appear.

00:32:54.140 --> 00:32:55.670
And that's what we do next.

00:32:55.670 --> 00:33:00.420
We add on animation and then
we remove the no animation.

00:33:00.420 --> 00:33:03.760
We then play the animations.

00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:07.260
Like I said, there's two
types of animations happening.

00:33:07.260 --> 00:33:09.480
There's the continuous
player, which is that computer

00:33:09.480 --> 00:33:11.650
that's sort of lightly bouncing.

00:33:11.650 --> 00:33:12.860
That one's pretty straightforward.

00:33:12.860 --> 00:33:17.280
That's the computer player element
that we have, just dot play.

00:33:17.280 --> 00:33:19.070
The other two are based on scroll.

00:33:19.070 --> 00:33:24.660
So that's where the Lottie Player
interactivity guide comes into play.

00:33:24.660 --> 00:33:28.030
It's Lottiefiles.com/interactivity.

00:33:28.030 --> 00:33:30.770
They go through a ton of
examples of different ways

00:33:30.770 --> 00:33:34.930
that you can use JavaScript to
interact with their elements.

00:33:34.930 --> 00:33:38.170
Basically, for me,
it's kind of straightforward.

00:33:38.170 --> 00:33:41.500
You use their Lottie
interactivity class,

00:33:41.500 --> 00:33:45.440
which is what we call that second
script for in our functions.

00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:49.300
And then we create a new element.

00:33:49.300 --> 00:33:54.080
The player is the ID of the
element, the mode is scroll,

00:33:54.080 --> 00:33:55.730
and then a few actions.

00:33:55.730 --> 00:33:59.730
So we have visibility going from zero
to one because we're turning it on.

00:33:59.730 --> 00:34:02.020
So it's going from not
showing it to showing it.

00:34:02.020 --> 00:34:03.640
The type is seek.

00:34:03.640 --> 00:34:07.120
Then the frames,
that's really the only other thing.

00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:10.780
You have the player ID
and then the frames.

00:34:10.780 --> 00:34:14.410
Those are the two things that
really change on each of these.

00:34:14.410 --> 00:34:20.000
And the way to find out the number
of frames is you find what you like.

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:22.770
And I think you have
to create an account.

00:34:22.770 --> 00:34:24.540
I'm currently logged in.

00:34:24.540 --> 00:34:27.190
And so what you do is you
find the one you like,

00:34:27.190 --> 00:34:33.710
and underneath the animation,
there's a little cog settings.

00:34:33.710 --> 00:34:37.740
You click that, then there's
animation details that shows up.

00:34:37.740 --> 00:34:41.260
And then there's an item here
under the info that says, frames,

00:34:41.260 --> 00:34:44.150
and so that's going to give
you the number of frames.

00:34:44.150 --> 00:34:47.850
So you can see that one
was 152; this one's 119.

00:34:47.850 --> 00:34:50.160
And so you can use any numbers.

00:34:50.160 --> 00:34:52.520
This is basically the start
frame and the end frame.

00:34:52.520 --> 00:34:56.240
And so you can basically use
any numbers to start or end.

00:34:56.240 --> 00:34:58.928
I just like the whole
thing so I start at zero

00:34:58.929 --> 00:35:00.530
and end at the final frame.

00:35:00.530 --> 00:35:03.580
But it's up to you how you
want to animate that throughout

00:35:03.580 --> 00:35:04.620
whatever your frames are.

00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:11.480
The only thing that really I need
to go over in the pause function:

00:35:11.480 --> 00:35:14.550
Again, we're setting our
local storage to pause.

00:35:14.550 --> 00:35:16.650
We're changing our
ARIA-pressed to false.

00:35:16.650 --> 00:35:18.970
We're switching out our body class.

00:35:18.970 --> 00:35:22.030
The computer player that we
have, the one that's continuous,

00:35:22.030 --> 00:35:24.450
that one just is .pause.

00:35:24.450 --> 00:35:28.040
The other ones... you'll see
this Lottieinteractivity.create

00:35:29.470 --> 00:35:32.310
looks almost exactly the
same, except the only thing

00:35:32.310 --> 00:35:35.530
that changes is under frames;
instead of it being from zero

00:35:35.530 --> 00:35:39.340
to whatever,
it's now just a single frame.

00:35:39.340 --> 00:35:41.290
That can be any of the ones.

00:35:41.290 --> 00:35:43.900
If there's a specific place
you want to pause it at,

00:35:43.900 --> 00:35:45.460
you have to play a
little bit with it.

00:35:45.460 --> 00:35:48.470
I hadn't quite figured out
how to find the exact frame,

00:35:48.470 --> 00:35:50.430
but I just went to the end.

00:35:50.430 --> 00:35:53.380
And you can see that this
one that I'm on here,

00:35:53.380 --> 00:35:59.220
which is the whole browser window
scrolling as you scroll the page,

00:35:59.220 --> 00:36:02.380
the last frame sort of whites out.

00:36:02.380 --> 00:36:05.270
What I did is I went a
couple of frames before that

00:36:05.270 --> 00:36:08.480
in terms of the final frame.

00:36:08.480 --> 00:36:12.930
So the only change is the frames.

00:36:14.990 --> 00:36:19.450
If we come back to our
slideshow, that's it.

00:36:19.450 --> 00:36:21.710
In hindsight, this is very simple.

00:36:21.710 --> 00:36:24.140
It's a journey for
all of these things.

00:36:24.140 --> 00:36:29.080
If we go back, testing, you just
iterate on all your options.

00:36:30.290 --> 00:36:32.890
I might have a couple
of minutes here.

00:36:32.890 --> 00:36:35.580
These are screen recordings
that don't have any sound.

00:36:35.580 --> 00:36:39.380
I'm going to just tell you what
is happening in each of them.

00:36:39.380 --> 00:36:43.110
It's just to give you an
example of the thought process,

00:36:43.110 --> 00:36:44.950
and how I got to where I was.

00:36:44.950 --> 00:36:48.640
Because I got things working
once I figured out how to work

00:36:48.640 --> 00:36:49.580
with Lottie files.

00:36:49.580 --> 00:36:52.000
That was kind of the first
hurdle I had to jump through

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:54.490
because I wasn't familiar with it.

00:36:54.490 --> 00:36:57.230
It's just new,
and so you work with it, right?

00:36:57.230 --> 00:37:03.370
And so once I figured that out,
everything really fell into place

00:37:03.370 --> 00:37:04.320
with the rest of the code.

00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:08.080
And then we just kind of ended
up with these micro decisions.

00:37:08.080 --> 00:37:14.330
So this first one, as an example,
is in the bottom-left of...

00:37:14.330 --> 00:37:17.460
Each of these animations
that I'm playing shows you

00:37:17.460 --> 00:37:18.950
what the screen
reader would read out.

00:37:18.950 --> 00:37:23.240
But it basically says play
animation, selected toggle button,

00:37:23.240 --> 00:37:26.480
then play animations,
toggle button, then selected,

00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:28.030
play animations, toggle button.

00:37:28.030 --> 00:37:30.280
So that's what the
screen reader reads out.

00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:32.070
I felt like that was
a good place to start.

00:37:32.070 --> 00:37:35.520
The screen reader is nice
because it's saying, you know,

00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:37.780
play animations, selected.

00:37:37.780 --> 00:37:38.470
Yes.

00:37:38.470 --> 00:37:41.410
But visually to me,
I didn't necessarily like that

00:37:41.410 --> 00:37:46.910
because the circle indicator
is in the opposite direction

00:37:46.910 --> 00:37:50.100
of where my label
is, my button text.

00:37:50.100 --> 00:37:53.980
And because we don't have
a group of options together

00:37:53.980 --> 00:37:57.340
to sort of give us context,
it felt a little weird.

00:37:57.340 --> 00:38:03.190
So what I did was I then went to
animations and I tested that one.

00:38:04.300 --> 00:38:07.280
But what I did was I had
added also on and off text

00:38:07.280 --> 00:38:10.210
into a pseudo element,
and it's a little hard to catch.

00:38:10.210 --> 00:38:17.310
So watch that bottom screen-reader
box on the bottom-left.

00:38:17.310 --> 00:38:21.330
You can sort of see it flash
this text that comes on.

00:38:21.330 --> 00:38:26.120
It starts out the same as
the other one: animations on,

00:38:26.120 --> 00:38:29.580
selected toggle button,
but then it reads animations off

00:38:29.580 --> 00:38:30.860
and then animations on.

00:38:30.860 --> 00:38:34.100
So it sort of skips over
that toggle thing, because

00:38:34.100 --> 00:38:38.250
when we dynamically add
content to a button, it messes

00:38:38.250 --> 00:38:39.040
with the screen reader.

00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:42.050
So that obviously
wasn't the right choice.

00:38:43.700 --> 00:38:47.680
Then what I did was try that switch
option just to see what it was like.

00:38:47.680 --> 00:38:49.570
Voiceover seemed to
handle it pretty well.

00:38:49.570 --> 00:38:53.590
I kind of liked it, but since
it didn't have full support,

00:38:53.590 --> 00:38:54.590
I didn't want to use it.

00:38:55.910 --> 00:39:03.090
It basically says animations
on, switch off animation switch.

00:39:03.090 --> 00:39:06.330
So it's kind of nice and concise,
but it's not fully supported.

00:39:06.330 --> 00:39:09.150
So that's where we
ended up to this sort

00:39:09.150 --> 00:39:12.350
of final iteration before we
got to the one with the icons.

00:39:12.350 --> 00:39:16.130
It's basically the same as the first
one, just with the word animations.

00:39:16.130 --> 00:39:20.510
So I felt like it was a good
compromise between the screen reader

00:39:20.510 --> 00:39:21.890
and the visual usability.

00:39:23.900 --> 00:39:26.370
I did consider going
back to play animations,

00:39:26.370 --> 00:39:29.040
but I opted to keep
the shorter label.

00:39:29.040 --> 00:39:32.680
The icons might not be necessary.

00:39:32.680 --> 00:39:36.440
So we have this final version
that's currently on the website

00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:39.570
with the play and the pause.
It might not be necessary,

00:39:39.570 --> 00:39:42.780
but I don't like ambiguity.

00:39:42.780 --> 00:39:47.050
Part of my neurodivergence and
part of what's helping me navigate

00:39:47.050 --> 00:39:49.820
the web easier is just
removing all ambiguity.

00:39:49.820 --> 00:39:54.000
It doesn't hurt anything to add these
icons, and it helps people like me,

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:56.980
so I said add them.
It also makes it more consistent

00:39:56.980 --> 00:40:01.050
with the things like light
and dark mode, and they have,

00:40:01.050 --> 00:40:03.450
like, the sun and the moon icon.

00:40:03.450 --> 00:40:07.540
So it kind of felt right; free
from ambiguity, nice and concise,

00:40:07.540 --> 00:40:09.360
Here’s what the options are.

00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:14.810
So in terms of some final steps
here, future plans would be,

00:40:14.810 --> 00:40:19.290
I kind of hinted at this
earlier, make it dynamic, put it

00:40:19.290 --> 00:40:21.360
in a plugin as a custom block.

00:40:21.360 --> 00:40:22.990
And let's exit out of this again.

00:40:22.990 --> 00:40:25.610
So we have, just to
review, a few places

00:40:25.610 --> 00:40:27.800
where we're hard coding
things, right?

00:40:27.800 --> 00:40:35.030
In our HTML, we have our lobby
player ID, the source, the height,

00:40:35.030 --> 00:40:39.990
the width, the no-script image,
the alt text, and then we have

00:40:39.990 --> 00:40:46.510
whether it's a continuous animation
or an on-scroll animation.

00:40:46.510 --> 00:40:49.590
And all those could just
be variables that we plug

00:40:49.590 --> 00:40:55.720
into this basic script and text.

00:40:55.720 --> 00:40:59.250
And then being able to make
this dynamic by not having

00:40:59.250 --> 00:41:03.980
to hard-code these lobby elements
in here, and being able to iterate,

00:41:03.980 --> 00:41:07.270
you know, among things that have a
certain class, or things like that.

00:41:07.270 --> 00:41:09.970
So this is sort of, you
know, proof of concept, it's,

00:41:09.970 --> 00:41:11.330
Get everything working.

00:41:11.330 --> 00:41:13.680
And then like I said,
the good news is I can go in here

00:41:13.680 --> 00:41:18.500
and just swap out this custom
HTML for a plugin, right?

00:41:18.500 --> 00:41:21.860
So if I made it dynamic, stuck it
in a plugin, activate the plugin,

00:41:21.860 --> 00:41:25.440
now I can use that
on any site at all,

00:41:25.440 --> 00:41:28.670
and then I'm adding in the
elements from the custom block.

00:41:28.670 --> 00:41:30.550
So that's sort of the next
phase of this, which would be

00:41:30.550 --> 00:41:35.040
to make this a truly reusable
thing that now I don't have

00:41:35.040 --> 00:41:36.280
to do anything to my theme.

00:41:36.280 --> 00:41:38.060
I don't have to mess with anything.

00:41:38.060 --> 00:41:42.850
All I have to do is swap out
this custom HTML for a new block.

00:41:44.540 --> 00:41:47.820
There's not one way to do it,
and there's obviously improvements

00:41:47.820 --> 00:41:48.820
that can be made.

00:41:50.110 --> 00:41:54.240
In terms of some final thoughts
on this, this can, like I said,

00:41:54.240 --> 00:41:56.960
be used for any type of setting
that needs to be toggled,

00:41:56.960 --> 00:41:58.360
but use the right method, right?

00:41:58.360 --> 00:42:00.850
If you have something that
has more than two options,

00:42:00.850 --> 00:42:02.120
you're going to want
multiple buttons.

00:42:03.300 --> 00:42:06.640
Then don't add a bunch of
toggles to your website.

00:42:06.640 --> 00:42:08.950
We aren't trying to
rebuild some kind

00:42:08.950 --> 00:42:11.910
of custom accessibility
overlay situation.

00:42:11.910 --> 00:42:14.963
We don't need to give everybody
a hundred different things

00:42:14.964 --> 00:42:15.980
to customize.

00:42:15.980 --> 00:42:19.900
If it's a web app that
somebody's on for hours in a day,

00:42:19.900 --> 00:42:24.800
they have a settings page: turn
on dark mode, turn on animations,

00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:27.720
minimize this, do that.
That's great.

00:42:27.720 --> 00:42:33.700
However, for a website, the most
useful thing, stick it at the top.

00:42:33.700 --> 00:42:38.330
The rest can be used as according
to their system preferences, right?

00:42:38.330 --> 00:42:41.730
So we sort of pick what would
be the most impactful; one,

00:42:41.730 --> 00:42:45.010
maybe two, I've seen a few
websites do an animation one

00:42:45.010 --> 00:42:47.060
and a color mode one.

00:42:47.060 --> 00:42:49.880
Those seem like the most useful,
and those can be at the top.

00:42:49.880 --> 00:42:53.640
But we don't want to have somebody
tabbing through a million options.

00:42:53.640 --> 00:42:55.250
It's just not necessary.

00:42:55.250 --> 00:42:59.110
You use this as a base idea
and get the most important,

00:42:59.110 --> 00:43:01.760
relevant thing for your
users, put it at the top.

00:43:01.760 --> 00:43:04.450
Pick what makes the most
sense and focus on those.

00:43:05.580 --> 00:43:06.760
So that's it for me.

00:43:06.760 --> 00:43:14.700
I have four links here that are
on my Overnight Website page

00:43:14.700 --> 00:43:18.240
for this session, and then you
can also download these slides

00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:19.800
and click on them from here.

00:43:19.800 --> 00:43:22.920
And that gives you some background
information on where I got

00:43:22.920 --> 00:43:27.260
some of my information on
the Lottie files, and so on.

00:43:27.260 --> 00:43:30.960
The great thing is you can take this
and sort of use it for Custom CSS.

00:43:30.960 --> 00:43:33.770
You can use it for animating
SVGs, all that stuff.

00:43:34.991 --> 00:43:39.281
And if you want to learn more,
there is Overnightwebsite.com/links.

00:43:39.290 --> 00:43:39.910
And that's it for me.

00:43:46.161 --> 00:43:50.100
I think I will leave this
up, see if anybody needs me.

00:43:53.966 --> 00:43:56.153
RONAK: Thank you, Danielle,
for the wonderful session.

00:43:58.900 --> 00:44:05.360
We do not have much
questions in the Q&A box.

00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:10.890
So if anyone has questions,
you can still post the questions

00:44:12.180 --> 00:44:14.680
in the box so we can have it.

00:44:33.040 --> 00:44:37.910
Meanwhile, I am sharing this
session link here in the chat box.

00:44:37.910 --> 00:44:42.240
So if anyone want to grab the
slides, they can grab from here.

00:44:42.240 --> 00:44:42.666
DANIELLE: Yeah.

00:44:47.490 --> 00:44:53.050
And then what I'll do is, I'll put
the direct link to this as well.

00:44:58.520 --> 00:45:05.150
So this here is
Overnightwebsite.com/WPA11yday.

00:45:05.150 --> 00:45:07.750
And that's the link that was at
the top of my slides as well.

00:45:09.260 --> 00:45:09.590
RONAK: Good.

00:45:12.500 --> 00:45:14.160
DANIELLE: And I'm always
around for questions, too.

00:45:14.160 --> 00:45:17.810
So like I said, at QueerDevPerson,
if you're watching this later

00:45:17.810 --> 00:45:22.050
and you come up with a
question, or a feature request,

00:45:22.050 --> 00:45:24.413
or a suggestion,
or anything like that,

00:45:24.414 --> 00:45:26.480
I'm always down for conversations.

00:45:27.468 --> 00:45:28.448
RONAK: Yes, correct.

00:45:32.380 --> 00:45:36.080
OK, let me wait one minute.

00:45:37.210 --> 00:45:41.350
Yes, there is a one question,
Daniel, from the Luna:

00:45:41.350 --> 00:45:45.790
Do you have any advice for
pushing A11Y at your workplace

00:45:45.790 --> 00:45:47.450
or beginning your own business?

00:45:49.059 --> 00:45:49.631
DANIELLE: Sure.

00:45:50.330 --> 00:45:56.630
Yeah, I mean, it's basically kind of
how I approached this one element,

00:45:56.630 --> 00:45:58.200
just on a bigger scale.

00:45:58.200 --> 00:46:03.890
So much like I walked through
the individual things of,

00:46:03.890 --> 00:46:05.530
why am I adding this?

00:46:05.530 --> 00:46:08.470
Is it going to cause any problems?

00:46:08.470 --> 00:46:11.420
Basically everything I
ran through in my journey

00:46:11.420 --> 00:46:15.140
of adding an accessibility,
single toggle is kind

00:46:15.140 --> 00:46:16.920
of how you approach
everything else.

00:46:16.920 --> 00:46:21.650
It's all about a process and
finding a couple of good resources.

00:46:21.650 --> 00:46:23.760
There's the WordPress
Accessibility Meetup.

00:46:23.760 --> 00:46:26.150
There's all kinds of blogs.

00:46:27.270 --> 00:46:31.070
Anything that you can find to
give you some starting points.

00:46:31.070 --> 00:46:33.520
And then once you learn one
thing, add on another.

00:46:34.850 --> 00:46:37.290
It's really just about starting.

00:46:37.290 --> 00:46:40.990
And once you start thinking about
things in terms of accessibility,

00:46:40.990 --> 00:46:43.960
that's kind of how you tend to
look at everything when it comes

00:46:43.960 --> 00:46:47.950
to websites, and you're always
looking through things in that lens.

00:46:47.950 --> 00:46:51.270
And it's really just about asking
questions, and being curious,

00:46:51.270 --> 00:46:54.700
and doing some research to try
to find the best way to do it.

00:46:54.700 --> 00:46:58.250
I would say look into
accessibility statements.

00:46:58.250 --> 00:47:02.920
I think a lot of times, if we give
people a great place to find us

00:47:02.920 --> 00:47:05.730
and report issues that they
have, and make it easy to find,

00:47:05.730 --> 00:47:09.410
stick it in the footer, and give
a very clear way to contact you,

00:47:09.410 --> 00:47:11.670
that's a good way to know what
problems people are having,

00:47:11.670 --> 00:47:12.920
and that's a good place to start.

00:47:14.510 --> 00:47:18.980
So I would just find ways
to start with things.

00:47:18.980 --> 00:47:20.460
Do the easy stuff.

00:47:20.460 --> 00:47:23.120
Like I had sort of rattled off
in the beginning, you have,

00:47:23.120 --> 00:47:26.910
like, heading order
and image alt text.

00:47:26.910 --> 00:47:31.840
An accessible navigation is really
hard to do as a beginner thing.

00:47:31.840 --> 00:47:34.950
So pick something and sort
of just dive right into it,

00:47:34.950 --> 00:47:36.390
and see where it takes you.

00:47:36.390 --> 00:47:38.160
Just kind of be in it
for the journey, I think.

00:47:42.057 --> 00:47:45.270
RONAK: One more question
from the same person:

00:47:45.270 --> 00:47:50.940
What are your thoughts on
Threejs.org and it’s accessibility?

00:47:52.340 --> 00:47:54.390
DANIELLE: I have no idea.

00:47:55.550 --> 00:47:56.530
I just clicked on it.

00:47:56.530 --> 00:47:56.920
Let's see.

00:47:56.920 --> 00:47:57.920
Threejs.

00:47:59.080 --> 00:48:01.770
I would be interested in
learning about what it is.

00:48:01.770 --> 00:48:04.100
If you want to reach out to
me, tell me about it,

00:48:04.100 --> 00:48:08.500
and I can sort of be a little more
informed about how to approach it.

00:48:08.500 --> 00:48:09.920
I don't really know much about it.

00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:11.970
Is it an animation library?

00:48:11.970 --> 00:48:12.970
Is that what it is?

00:48:14.580 --> 00:48:15.580
RONAK: OK.

00:48:16.540 --> 00:48:17.820
Thank you, Danielle.

00:48:19.180 --> 00:48:19.680
DANIELLE: Yes.

00:48:19.680 --> 00:48:21.450
So if that's what it
is, I don't know.

00:48:22.620 --> 00:48:24.810
My first instinct would be
to answer is it’s probably

00:48:24.810 --> 00:48:27.190
as accessible as somebody makes it.

00:48:27.190 --> 00:48:30.950
So if it's an animation library,
it's going to be something

00:48:30.950 --> 00:48:33.500
that somebody's going
to use and put together.

00:48:33.500 --> 00:48:33.800
Let's see.

00:48:33.800 --> 00:48:36.840
Threejs allows you to use
3d models and web design

00:48:36.840 --> 00:48:42.220
and then the motion sensitivity.
Again, my first instinct is

00:48:42.220 --> 00:48:48.310
to say have it be a conditional
thing, like, only showing on people

00:48:48.310 --> 00:48:52.650
who explicitly allow it,
and then user test it.

00:48:52.650 --> 00:48:55.600
I would say it probably depends
on how much motion you're adding,

00:48:55.600 --> 00:48:59.000
how much blinking there is.

00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:03.590
It's going to really depend on what
you're doing within that 3D element.

00:49:03.590 --> 00:49:05.600
And then I would say that kind
of stuff, you probably have

00:49:05.600 --> 00:49:08.860
to user test and get some feedback
on whether it causes issues

00:49:08.860 --> 00:49:09.860
for people.

00:49:14.900 --> 00:49:18.990
RONAK: OK, no anymore questions.

00:49:18.990 --> 00:49:21.460
So let's go towards the conclusion.

00:49:23.430 --> 00:49:26.440
Thank you for attending
the session with Danielle.

00:49:26.440 --> 00:49:29.090
