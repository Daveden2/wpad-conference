 AMBER HINDS: WordPress
Accessibility Day 2023:

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:05.720
Lightning Talk -

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:10.170
Making a Visual Tool Accessible
to Screen readers, with Speakers,

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.780
Amber Hinds, CEO,
Equalized Digital.

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.600
This presentation was
recorded September 28, 2023.

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:20.290
Hello, everyone.

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:21.790
My name is Amber Hinds.

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:25.240
I'm the CEO of Equalized
Digital, and I'm excited

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.780
to be presenting Making
a Visual Tool Accessible

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:32.060
to Screen reader users
along with Raghavendra.

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:33.340
Raghavendra,
do you want to introduce yourself?

00:00:34.467 --> 00:00:35.160
 RAGHAVENDRA: Hi, everyone.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.520
My name is Raghavendra.

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.490
I am the founder
of DigitalA11y.com.

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:40.730
I'm a certified professional
in Web Accessibility.

00:00:44.533 --> 00:00:47.070
 AMBER: So I'm going to
start by playing a short video.

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.310
It doesn't have any sound in it.

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:51.690
I'm going to explain what's
happening and describe it for anyone

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:52.820
who can't see.

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.520
And it is something that
sort of shows what we built

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.230
and what we were talking about
trying to make accessible to people

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.970
who are screen reader users.

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:08.460
So this is the block editor.

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.240
We're scrolling down
below the editor.

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.490
There is a meta box for
accessibility checker.

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.830
And then I'm going to the
Details tab, and I'm just going

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.580
to click on the Image
Missing Alternative Text.

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.220
There are two issues, and I can
now click a link that says View

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.700
on Page, and that will take me
to the front-end of the website,

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:33.770
and it will load the issue
and highlight that image

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.700
that was missing alternative
text, to help me find it.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.080
Then I go find it up
in the block editor,

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.230
and I just add the
alternative text.

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:43.840
So I'm writing...
This is an image of a person.

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.480
I tried to type
David wearing a suit.

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.740
I had a typo, so I fixed it.

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.020
And I hit Save.

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.450
And then if I update my post,
when I scroll back down,

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.930
to the Accessibility Checker
box, updates,

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:02.490
and I can see there's only one
image missing alternative text.

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:03.630
Just pausing for a second.

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.040
This works pretty well for things
that are in the block editor.

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.630
Usually it's easy, especially if
it's an image to see it and say,

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.480
OK, I know what this is.

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.840
But we're going to look at
aria-hidden now, and we'll see...

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:24.840
So we'll see if I go,
I've expanded aria-hidden.

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.140
I see these social media links.

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:27.530
I scroll up.

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.260
Oh, they're not in my post.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:34.330
So if I click View on Page,
where this is helpful, it's going

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.200
to show me again on the
front end where this shows up

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.860
and it's down in the footer.

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.530
So I would know, oh,
if I want to fix this, I would have

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:47.130
to go fix this in my widgets or
wherever my footer content is created

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:48.130
on the post.

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:56.420
Now, if I refresh the page,
I'm going to show you a little bit

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.280
of what it looks like
to just walk through

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.450
the accessibility checker
issues purely on the front-end

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.970
without reading them on
the table on the back-end.

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:12.260
It's going to load.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.080
It says 20 errors and 6 warnings.

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:20.490
There is a box there in the
bottom right corner, and on it,

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:23.260
there's buttons for
previous and next.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.580
And you can click through and
it will move through each issue.

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:29.591
So we're seeing image,
empty alternative text,

00:03:29.592 --> 00:03:31.000
improper use of link,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.270
incorrect heading order and
it's jumping through the page

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:36.940
and highlighting different
elements on the page.

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.780
What if we get to something
that we're not sure about?

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.720
So I can see this graduate
programs, advanced degrees.

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.100
It's saying improper use of link.

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:48.330
And I think, well,
that's really weird.

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.200
I think that's a link that works.

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.840
This is where we added a Show Code
functionality on the front-end.

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:58.640
So I can click Show Code,
it will show me the link and oh,

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.810
I see, it says, href.

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.720
The href on the link is actually
going to a hashtag, It's not going

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:08.090
to an actual link.

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:10.730
So that's something where
I forgot to put in the link

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:13.120
where See Events figures
it's supposed to go.

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:17.790
So that explains to me why this
is saying this isn't a link.

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:19.110
Of course,
it's supposed to be a link.

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:20.630
It's just missing the URL.

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:32.800
Then sometimes we get things where
we can't actually see the element

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.800
because it's hidden,
and we've added a warning

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:39.080
that says the element is not
visual, try a disabling style.

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.730
So let me show you how that works.

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:46.330
There is a disabled styles button in
the main accessibility checker panel,

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:51.610
and if we click that,
then it will load the entire page.

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:55.400
I can see in this instance
that it is a search button,

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.330
which I can see up at
the top of the page.

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:58.760
I have my Skip-to-content link.

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:02.610
I have Current Students,
Maps Directory giving.

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:08.980
So if I come back and I enable
styles again, I get my page

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:13.590
and I can see, oh,
I have a search icon at the top,

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:18.190
right next to those other items
if I click on it, then this is

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:21.870
where that button is that
doesn't have sufficient contrast.

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:24.770
It's highlighting what just
looks like an empty white square,

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:29.770
because I think that there is a white
icon on a white background here.

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:34.640
So this is one way that I can help
find things if they're not visible.

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:41.040
And as you can see, it's targeted
at sighted users, but our goal

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:46.340
with this was not to make something
that only sighted people can use.

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:49.340
I want to touch for a
minute on why we made

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:53.210
this tool screen reader accessible
and why we've been focusing on this.

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:55.940
But for us,
it really aligned with our vision.

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:59.910
We really are striving towards a day
when all people have equal access

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:01.886
to information and
tools on the internet,

00:06:01.887 --> 00:06:03.250
regardless of their ability.

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:08.590
And so because of that,
it made sense for us to also ensure

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:15.030
that even our visual tools work
for people who don't have sight.

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:20.400
I also think that there are use
cases for screen reader users

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:24.530
who want to go through issues
that the plug-in is identifying

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:26.140
in the front-end context.

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:30.620
It allows them to reach other
elements on the website that, maybe,

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:36.110
are adjacent to code that's been
flagged or wrapped around it.

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:39.630
And then the other thing is for
us, this is a step towards building

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:43.510
something that allows accessibility
testers to log issues in the plug-in

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:44.530
as they manually test.

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:47.150
It's something that we
know we're going to do.

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:51.650
I don't have a timeline for it
yet, but this is the beginning

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:57.380
of being able to show that we
can have something that functions

00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:01.920
on the front-end of the website
on top of the website itself

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:08.000
and integrates with the plug-in
without causing problems

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.610
for perhaps a blind tester
who is auditing the website.

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:15.160
And then there is a bullet
point of legal compliance.

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:18.420
Legal compliance has nothing
to do with this on our end,

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:20.900
but I wanted to say that because
if you're trying to justify

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:24.230
why a visual tool that you are
building, whether it's for a client

00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:26.820
or for your own company,
and you need to justify that

00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:31.490
to higher-ups at the company,
why you're spending your time on it,

00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:35.250
legal compliance may be a good
reason to justify investing

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:37.810
in accessibility of everything
you build, even things

00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:40.520
that you think are
targeted at sighted users,

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:42.250
more than a non-sighted user.

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:45.400
So we decided we wanted to do it.

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:47.490
How have we tested it so far?

00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:53.600
All of our devs do accessibility
testing and then we also come in.

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:57.460
I accessibility test,
and we have people like Raghavendra,

00:07:57.460 --> 00:08:01.030
an accessibility specialist at our
company who do accessibility testing.

00:08:01.030 --> 00:08:05.140
We do manual keyboard
testing, zoomed into 400%.

00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:07.540
That modal window that you
saw, we made sure that

00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:11.080
even if it is overlaid on top of the
website and the website is zoomed

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:14.940
in 400%, someone who is a low
vision user, you can't see a lot

00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:19.580
of the website, but you can still
interact with all of the content

00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:22.820
in the modal, it functions
from a reflow perspective.

00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:26.850
I did screen reader
testing voiceover on Mac

00:08:26.850 --> 00:08:31.140
and Raghavendra did screen
reader testing in VDM windows

00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:33.860
and possibly JAWS
on windows as well.

00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:37.860
So I want to hand it over to
Raghavendra now so you can see

00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:42.570
how he experiences the plug-in
with his screen reader.

00:08:42.570 --> 00:08:43.920
Raghavendra,
do you want to take it away?

00:08:45.367 --> 00:08:47.800
 RAGHAVENDRA: So since I'm
demoing the accessibility checkup

00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:50.833
plug-in here, if I have to go...
Right now, this is the editor.

00:08:50.833 --> 00:09:01.484
[Screen Reader Voice]

00:09:01.485 --> 00:09:03.846
So these are all the blocks
but if I need to jump

00:09:03.847 --> 00:09:06.066
just to the accessibility
checker, I'm going

00:09:06.067 --> 00:09:09.340
to press the key number
two on my keyboard

00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:12.900
and it will take me to the heading
level two within this editor.

00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:16.028
[Screen Reader Voice]

00:09:16.028 --> 00:09:17.990
And which is the
accessibility checker.

00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:22.400
The accessibility checker is
very easy to navigate over here.

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:26.000
[Screen Reader Voice]

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.790
And it is expanded on the content...
I can collapse the content.

00:09:29.791 --> 00:09:33.125
[Screen Reader Voice]

00:09:33.126 --> 00:09:34.620
And the summary,
[Screen Reader Voice]

00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:36.350
Details, [Screen Reader Voice]

00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:37.310
Readability.

00:09:38.248 --> 00:09:41.890
This is a self-explanatory,
the summary of issues, the details

00:09:41.890 --> 00:09:45.800
of issues and the readability
score, if this content is readable.

00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:49.370
 AMBER: For the developers
in the room it's worth noting

00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:52.800
that this is an element that we
actually ended up remediating

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:54.730
after doing accessibility tests.

00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:58.890
As you can see in the code here these
tabs were actually originally coded

00:09:58.890 --> 00:10:01.540
as links and then we did
our screen reader testing,

00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:04.580
and we realized that they
needed to be buttons.

00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:07.560
And so we used ARIA
role equals button

00:10:07.561 --> 00:10:10.310
and added some button functionality

00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:14.070
and then we used ARIA current
equals true, to communicate

00:10:14.070 --> 00:10:18.067
to screen reader users which
tab is currently being viewed.

00:10:19.602 --> 00:10:22.333
 RAGHAVENDRA:
[Screen Reader Voice]

00:10:22.995 --> 00:10:25.367
I'm just pressing down
arrow here just to navigate

00:10:25.367 --> 00:10:26.309
through the static text.

00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:49.109
[Screen Reader Voice]

00:10:49.109 --> 00:10:53.067
So we finished the
accessibility checker time here.

00:10:53.068 --> 00:10:55.400
If I need to go back,
I'm going to press Shift B.

00:10:55.400 --> 00:11:05.169
" [Screen Reader Voice]

00:11:05.169 --> 00:11:06.833
So I activated detail.

00:11:06.833 --> 00:11:10.275
[Screen Reader Voice]

00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:12.300
So we have headings for each issue.

00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:15.167
So I'll just navigate between
the issues using Header H key.

00:11:15.167 --> 00:11:24.461
[Screen Reader Voice]

00:11:24.461 --> 00:11:28.233
So another issue that we are going
to watch; an example here is–

00:11:28.233 --> 00:11:31.042
[Screen Reader Voice]

00:11:31.042 --> 00:11:37.434
–images missing alternate text,
and, [Screen Reader Voice]

00:11:37.434 --> 00:11:39.380
I expanded the list
of issues over here.

00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:42.188
[Screen Reader Voice]

00:11:42.188 --> 00:11:43.833
We have the issue ID.

00:11:43.833 --> 00:11:46.733
 AMBER: You'll notice as
Raghavendra goes through this

00:11:46.733 --> 00:11:48.696
with the screen reader,
that you're hearing headings

00:11:48.696 --> 00:11:52.033
that are not visible on the
page and also issue IDs.

00:11:52.034 --> 00:11:55.867
This was another enhancement that
we made after doing user testing

00:11:55.868 --> 00:11:56.868
and getting feedback.

00:11:56.869 --> 00:12:01.133
For a sighted person,
they don't really need the issue ID

00:12:01.133 --> 00:12:04.200
and they're seeing this
displayed as if it's a table,

00:12:04.201 --> 00:12:05.800
but it couldn't be coded as a table

00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:08.382
because of some of the complex
functionality that needs

00:12:08.382 --> 00:12:12.133
to happen around our ignore
settings screen visibility.

00:12:12.133 --> 00:12:17.133
So where we landed was,
we are pulling the issue ID

00:12:17.133 --> 00:12:23.267
from the database, and outputting
that in a heading above each section

00:12:24.473 --> 00:12:27.800
for screen reader users,
and then we reference that.

00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:30.733
So on the image, for example, we
don't know what the alternative text

00:12:30.733 --> 00:12:34.267
for this is, because the user
obviously didn't provide it.

00:12:34.267 --> 00:12:39.633
So we've given an alternative
text that references the ID number

00:12:39.633 --> 00:12:43.899
for the issue, which then makes
it more clear that this image goes

00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:44.900
with that issue.

00:12:44.901 --> 00:12:57.233
[Screen Reader Voice]

00:12:57.233 --> 00:12:59.733
 RAGHAVENDRA: So when I
read the testimonial avatar,

00:12:59.733 --> 00:13:04.100
I knew this is part of the
testimonial block somewhere.

00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:05.970
So I can do two things.

00:13:05.970 --> 00:13:10.160
I can go fix it in the testimonial
block within the back-end editor,

00:13:10.161 --> 00:13:14.299
but I would want to check which
issue is it in the front-end.

00:13:14.299 --> 00:13:19.291
So what I do is generally...
[Screen Reader Voice]

00:13:19.291 --> 00:13:21.133
So I'm going to open it.

00:13:21.133 --> 00:13:27.704
[Screen Reader Voice]

00:13:27.704 --> 00:13:30.133
 AMBER: So I think
it's worth noting here,

00:13:30.133 --> 00:13:33.400
we had a lot of internal
conversations about this,

00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:37.633
and whether or not we'll keep it
as there's two separate modals,

00:13:37.633 --> 00:13:40.670
almost that are up over the page.

00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:44.110
But one thing initially,
they were jumping focus

00:13:44.110 --> 00:13:48.030
when you hit that next button
actually to the element on the page.

00:13:48.030 --> 00:13:50.080
But then I'm like,
it's really hard to get back

00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:52.050
to what the problem actually was.

00:13:52.050 --> 00:13:55.490
So what I had them do was
take the focus into the modal

00:13:55.490 --> 00:14:00.940
that explains the issue,
which I think works a little better.

00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:02.630
 RAGHAVENDRA: So
this is more helpful.

00:14:02.630 --> 00:14:07.280
The sighted screen reader user who
is also an accessibility specialist

00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:13.100
is more interested in the code,
because they can guide the developer

00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:16.640
or the person with whom they
are working towards the code.

00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:19.470
And for non-technical people,
a regular WordPress user,

00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:22.730
the issue gets highlighted.

00:14:22.730 --> 00:14:25.180
It's easy for them to fix it.

00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:27.820
As I said,
my site assistant was a Designer

00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:33.580
and she never used
WordPress in her life.

00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:36.748
And she used WordPress,
she used Gutenberg,

00:14:36.749 --> 00:14:38.980
she's able to design websites.

00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:44.310
This one got her up to speed
on accessibility much faster

00:14:44.310 --> 00:14:46.950
rather than any other
Chrome extension.

00:14:46.950 --> 00:14:50.470
 AMBER: This was a fast look at
some of the things we've been doing

00:14:50.470 --> 00:14:54.000
to make equalized digital
accessibility checker more accessible

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:55.590
for screen reader users.

00:14:55.590 --> 00:14:57.742
I hope that you've
found it interesting

00:14:57.743 --> 00:14:59.410
to see how Raghavendra engages

00:14:59.410 --> 00:15:03.220
with the plug-in,
and also that it's inspiring.

00:15:03.220 --> 00:15:05.700
I want to leave you
with two action items.

00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:07.760
The first is for
plug-in developers.

00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:10.410
Please test your plug-ins
with a screen reader,

00:15:10.410 --> 00:15:14.200
or if you're not sure how,
hire a tester to test it for you.

00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:16.720
Decide what you can fix this week.

00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:19.860
Even if it's small,
you can make a big difference.

00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:23.100
Website creators,
try using a screen reader,

00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:25.580
or an automated tool like
accessibility checker.

00:15:25.580 --> 00:15:28.930
We have a free version on
WordPress.org to find problems

00:15:28.930 --> 00:15:31.970
on your website,
and make a plan for fixes.
