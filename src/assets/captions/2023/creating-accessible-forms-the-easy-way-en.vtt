00:00:00.047 --> 00:00:03.167
 AMBER HINDS: WordPress
Accessibility Day 2023:

00:00:03.167 --> 00:00:04.550
Lightning Talk -

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:08.710
Creating accessible forms the
easy way, with Morgan Kay,

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:12.430
Software Engineer at
Rocketgenius, and Rian Rietveld,

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:16.280
Web Accessibility Expert,
The A11Y Collective.

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:19.710
This presentation was
recorded September 28th, 2023.

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.120
 RONAK GANATRA: Hello, Welcome to
WordPress Accessibility Day 2023.

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:27.680
My name is Ronak Ganatra,
and I am a senior WordPress Engineer

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:28.810
at Multidots.

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:32.170
This session is a Lightning
round with the three short talks

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:34.070
that have been pre-recorded.

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:39.920
The first talk in this session
is creating accessibility forms

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:47.220
the easy way, by Rian Rietveld,
Web Accessibility Expert,

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:54.370
the A11Y Collective, and Morgan Kay,
Software Engineer at Rocketgenius.

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.340
There will be no Q and A
during this lightning round,

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.940
but please use the chat to
connect with other attendees.

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:11.006
And maybe Rian is around, so you
can connect with them as well.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.510
 MORGAN KAY: Hello.

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:19.250
We're going to talk about
forms and accessibility.

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.860
Forms are the most common
interactive elements on websites

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.790
and the most basic way for users
to share information with you.

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.530
That makes it really important
for your forms to be accessible.

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.660
If users can't fill out your form,
they can't interact with you,

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.220
they can't place an order,
they can't register for your event,

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:37.270
or fill out your survey.

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.100
But making an accessible
form can be intimidating.

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.940
There are a lot of things
you need to know to comply

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:44.920
with accessibility standards.

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.670
Fortunately, Gravity form makes it
easy to create accessible forms.

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:51.480
By just paying attention
to a few settings,

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.570
you can create accessible
forms quickly and easily.

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.740
My name is Morgan Kay, and I am
an Engineer at Gravity Forms.

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.850
I will be joined by Rian
Rietveld, an accessibility expert

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.390
at Level Level and
The A11y Collective.

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.260
Together we will show you how
to make an accessible form

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:09.370
with Gravity Forms.

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.350
So let's dive in and
start creating a form.

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:21.060
I'm going to start with a blank form
so that I can add my own fields,

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.180
and let's call this,
Customer Information.

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:34.760
Let's add some fields here,
let's put in a Name field,

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.390
and an Address field,
maybe we want to know what days

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.940
of the week people
are available for,

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.760
so let's put in this
Multi-Select field.

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.850
Let's go to Edit Choices
and add Days of the Week.

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:53.070
So the thing about a Multi-Select
field is, it's this box

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:59.020
where you can select
multiple items from this box.

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:02.840
So that's great if we've
got a situation where people

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.810
might have multiple answers
to a question, right?

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.500
But the problem is there's
this accessibility warning

00:03:13.501 --> 00:03:14.820
about this field.

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:21.350
So let's have Rian show us why
this field is not recommended

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:22.960
if you want your form
to be accessible.

00:03:27.633 --> 00:03:30.860
 RIAN RIETVELD: Multi-Selects are
difficult to operate with a mouse,

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:32.110
keyboard or screen reader.

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.231
People struggle filling them out,

00:03:35.232 --> 00:03:38.880
especially when the choices
are not next to each other.

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:44.820
For example, I am available
on Monday and Wednesday.

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:53.810
When I click Monday, and then
Wednesday, Monday is deselected.

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:58.450
I have to press the Control key,
or Command key to select them both.

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:01.250
Now with keyboard only.

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:11.773
I tap into the field,
press down with the Arrow key,

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:15.830
I press the Spacebar
to select the Day.

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:22.000
I hold down the Control key or
Command key, press down again,

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:27.160
release the Control or Command
key, press Spacebar again

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:30.610
and then press Tab to
leave the Multi-Select.

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.570
This doesn't work well in Safari.

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:44.490
When I tap in the field,
Arrow down to Monday, press Spacebar,

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:51.580
hold Command key, and go down
again, Monday is forgotten.

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:57.650
The screen reader voice over
is used together with Safari,

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:01.620
and therefore this screen reader
users also cannot use this option.

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:07.050
Multi-Select is too complicated
to operate and doesn't work well

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:07.650
with Safari.

00:05:12.583 --> 00:05:14.350
 MORGAN: So we can't
use the Multi-Select

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:18.580
but fortunately we have some
other options available to us.

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:22.200
So instead of a Multi-Select, a
good alternative is a Checkbox field

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:33.709
because just like Multi-Select,
users can select multiple choices.

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:35.850
So let's add in our
Days of the Week again,

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:48.130
So now users can
still select multiple.

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:51.560
They can use the keyboard to do
this, and they can see

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:53.100
which choices they have selected.

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:56.530
So this is a much easier
option for our users.

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:06.040
Now I've got this Drop-down field
here and I'm looking at the Settings

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:08.600
for this Drop-down and I
notice that there's a setting

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:12.610
for Enable enhanced user interface.

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:16.660
And enhanced user interface seems
like it would be a good idea

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:18.860
but I'm getting another
accessibility warning.

00:06:25.279 --> 00:06:28.209
 RIAN: The Drop-down with
an enhanced user interface

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:32.650
doesn't get keyboard focus so
cannot be used by a keyboard

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:33.650
or a screen reader.

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:38.200
In this demo we have
first a normal Drop-down,

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:40.650
and then an enhanced Drop-down.

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:44.340
If I tap through the form,
the enhanced Drop-down is skipped.

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:52.750
The first T-shirt size select,
and then the second one,

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:57.180
the enhanced one is skipped and focus
goes straight to the submit button.

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:03.400
It cannot be opened with a
keyboard, only with a mouse.

00:07:09.212 --> 00:07:11.739
 MORGAN: So now that
I have my form set up

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:15.510
and I know that all of the
fields in my form are accessible,

00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:18.690
there are some field settings
that I need to pay attention to.

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:23.720
So first of all, a lot of
people don't like how it looks

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:28.430
to have a label up at the
top of the field, especially

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:30.860
where we can go in here and
we can put in placeholders.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.050
And that's redundant, right?

00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:39.990
We don't need this name
up here anymore, right?

00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:43.200
Because it takes up a lot
of space and it looks ugly.

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:45.220
Oh no,
we're getting another warning.

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:56.600
 RIAN: A label gives
a form control its name.

00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:59.980
So screen readers and voice
recognition software can target

00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:01.490
and announce it properly.

00:08:02.444 --> 00:08:07.630
A placeholder is used to give a
hint about how to fill out a form.

00:08:09.370 --> 00:08:11.350
Always keep the label visible.

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:18.770
While typing, you may forget
what you needed to fill out.

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:23.980
And you have to delete the text
to make sure you are filling out

00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:24.980
the right info.

00:08:26.450 --> 00:08:32.390
Also a form using how to complete is
easy to check with a visible label.

00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:33.490
Be kind to your user.

00:08:38.583 --> 00:08:40.614
 MORGAN: So even though
we do have placeholders,

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:44.540
the form will be easier
for everyone to fill out

00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:45.930
if we do leave the label there.

00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:54.820
Another setting that we
need to pay attention to

00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:57.750
is the sub-label placement.

00:08:57.750 --> 00:09:02.200
So some of these fields like Name
and Address have multiple inputs

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:07.000
on the field, and the field
itself gets a label, but then each

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.800
of the individual inputs
has its own sublabel.

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:15.240
And there is a setting
under appearance for

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:20.170
whether the sub-label should
be above or below the inputs.

00:09:20.170 --> 00:09:23.810
And there's also,
if we go to the form settings page,

00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:29.020
there is actually a
global setting for this.

00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:36.470
So we can set the sub-label placement
to be below or above the inputs.

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:43.830
And once we do that, that is
going to impact all of the fields

00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:51.830
on this form, or we can
select the sub-label placement

00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:59.110
for individual fields if you wanted
some of them to be different.

00:09:59.110 --> 00:10:03.380
So, Rian, could you talk about
why we want these to be above

00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:05.380
or below, and whether they
should all be the same?

00:10:09.226 --> 00:10:11.040
 RIAN: People read
from the top down,

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:14.500
and expect the information
they need to be in that order.

00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:18.200
A form will be much
easier to fill out

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:22.170
when the labels are above the
inputs as the users expect,

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:25.140
especially with the address.

00:10:26.170 --> 00:10:31.190
It's visually much clearer when the
label belongs to which input field.

00:10:32.950 --> 00:10:36.630
Compare below and above.

00:10:38.890 --> 00:10:40.900
Be kind to your users.

00:10:44.967 --> 00:10:48.900
 MORGAN: In some fields
like Name and Address,

00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:54.010
under the Advanced Settings
tab, there is an option

00:10:54.010 --> 00:10:56.020
for enable autocomplete.

00:10:57.410 --> 00:11:03.260
And this, by default,
sometimes provides some attributes.

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:06.110
But this looks like a
pretty advanced feature.

00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:07.610
Can you explain what's
going on here, Rian?

00:11:10.833 --> 00:11:13.893
 RIAN: Using autocomplete is
an accessibility requirement

00:11:13.894 --> 00:11:15.990
not everyone is happy about.

00:11:17.050 --> 00:11:20.870
Autocomplete for credit card
information may be a security issue.

00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:26.630
But it is helpful to let the browser
automatically fill out your name,

00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:28.340
email, and address data.

00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:33.850
Especially for people that have
difficulties with typing or memory.

00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:42.540
On the website of the MDN, you
can find a complete set of values

00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:44.360
for autocomplete.

00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:51.530
And note, there is no value for
City, so use Address level 2 instead.

00:11:55.099 --> 00:11:59.530
 MORGAN: The Submit button in
our form also has some settings.

00:12:00.090 --> 00:12:05.680
For instance, I could set
an image as an input type.

00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:08.210
An image seems like a nice idea
because it would look a lot nicer

00:12:08.210 --> 00:12:11.450
than that button, but why are we
getting an accessibility warning

00:12:11.450 --> 00:12:12.140
about this?

00:12:16.001 --> 00:12:19.700
 RIAN: Some users zoom in to
be able to read the text better.

00:12:20.890 --> 00:12:26.550
There are two ways to zoom
in; everything or text only.

00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:32.820
For accessibility, you must
be able to zoom in up to 400%.

00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:35.860
Let's do that.

00:12:45.130 --> 00:12:50.030
The chances are the image will become
blurry and the text unreadable.

00:12:53.310 --> 00:12:58.360
And the user must be able to
zoom in text only up to 200%.

00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:01.150
Let's do that.

00:13:05.530 --> 00:13:08.190
Only text is enlarged,
images are not.

00:13:09.250 --> 00:13:12.750
So the user may still not be
able to read what's on the image.

00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:16.690
Don't use an image
for the submit button.

00:13:19.710 --> 00:13:23.320
 MORGAN: Okay,
so I'll stick with the text input,

00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:26.250
but I can also put conditional
logic on the submit button.

00:13:26.250 --> 00:13:34.250
Wouldn't it make sense to not show
the submit button, for instance,

00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:36.630
if they haven't
selected a T-shirt size?

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:41.230
That way they can't fill
out the form incorrectly?

00:13:45.488 --> 00:13:48.770
 RIAN: Hiding the submit
button can cause anxiety.

00:13:49.930 --> 00:13:54.410
If a form doesn't look or behave
as expected, people may leave

00:13:54.410 --> 00:13:58.220
because they can't figure
out how to submit form.

00:13:58.220 --> 00:13:59.660
Use error messages for that.

00:14:03.021 --> 00:14:06.910
 MORGAN: So, now that our fields
and field settings are all set up

00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:11.370
to be accessible, let's go
look at the form settings page.

00:14:11.370 --> 00:14:13.820
Because there are some settings here
that we need to pay attention to.

00:14:15.010 --> 00:14:18.550
We already talked about putting
our sub-labels above the inputs,

00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:22.280
and we can do that form-wide
here instead of having to do it

00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:23.670
for each field.

00:14:23.670 --> 00:14:27.350
There's another setting
here for validation summary.

00:14:27.350 --> 00:14:29.030
Rian, can you explain
what this one is about?

00:14:34.544 --> 00:14:36.922
 RIAN: We want to give
users all the help they need

00:14:36.923 --> 00:14:38.530
to fill out a form.

00:14:39.770 --> 00:14:45.510
A summary above the form is a great
help for not-that-web-savvy users,

00:14:45.510 --> 00:14:48.590
and also for blind users
and keyboard users.

00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:53.190
As Summary explains
clearly what still needs

00:14:53.190 --> 00:15:01.349
to be done before submitting the
form, and helps keyboard users

00:15:01.350 --> 00:15:04.960
to quickly tap to the
fields that need work.

00:15:09.877 --> 00:15:12.670
 MORGAN: Okay, we've set
up our form to be accessible.

00:15:12.670 --> 00:15:15.230
So now it's time to
share it with the world.

00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:17.780
So I'm going to click embed,
I'm going to create a new page.

00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:29.300
And now my form is embedded
on this page, and if I click

00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:33.770
on the form block,
I get some settings here.

00:15:33.770 --> 00:15:38.850
If I choose orbital as my form
theme, now I have a bunch

00:15:38.850 --> 00:15:43.470
of settings that let me change
the appearance of my form,

00:15:43.470 --> 00:15:45.390
including things
like button styles.

00:15:45.390 --> 00:15:47.510
So there are a lot of
color settings in here.

00:15:47.510 --> 00:15:51.830
So what happens if I start to
play with some of these colors?

00:15:56.190 --> 00:15:57.250
What are these warnings about?

00:16:00.373 --> 00:16:02.570
 RIAN: People must be
able to read your form.

00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:07.680
So the color contrast between text
and background must be sufficient.

00:16:08.940 --> 00:16:11.650
In this case,
the light blue background

00:16:11.650 --> 00:16:15.060
and the white text have
insufficient color contrast.

00:16:16.210 --> 00:16:21.180
You need to choose another
combination of color between text

00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:24.690
and background here, depending
on what looks best on your site.

00:16:31.503 --> 00:16:33.053
 MORGAN: So now you
know how to quickly

00:16:33.070 --> 00:16:37.040
and easily create accessible
forms with gravity forms.

00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:40.230

00:16:50.253 --> 00:16:53.219
 RONAK: Thank you to Gravity
forms for being the platinum sponsor

00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:55.180
or to WordPress Accessibility Day.

00:16:57.310 --> 00:17:00.690
As I said,
this is a lightning talk.

00:17:00.690 --> 00:17:05.120
So our second session is about
making the Visual tool accessible

00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:07.070
to screen readers.

00:17:07.070 --> 00:17:12.270
The session will be conducted by
