 AMBER HINDS: WordPress
Accessibility Day 2023.

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:08.530
Accessibility Beyond Blindness,
with speaker Allie Nimmons,

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:10.830
owner of Beedia Productions.

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.940
This presentation was
recorded September 27th, 2023.

00:00:16.293 --> 00:00:19.520
 AMANDA ROPER: Welcome to
WordPress Accessibility Day 2023.

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.050
My name is Amanda Roper.

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:23.930
I'm joining you from
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:26.830
I'm the Accessibility Program
Manager at T. Rowe Price,

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:28.860
where I am responsible
for developing

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:32.750
and maintaining the accessibility
program across local teams.

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.410
When I'm not solving for
accessibility issues in the world,

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.470
you can find me screen printing,
hiking, or in an art museum

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:41.490
with one of my many
vintage cameras at my side.

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.640
I'm so excited to be introducing
you to this talk today,

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.070
Accessibility Beyond
Blindness, with Allie Nimmons.

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.610
A little bit about Allie.

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:55.610
In 2014, after dropping
out of theater school,

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.180
Allie started teaching
herself how to code.

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.570
She got her first internship in
2015, where she was introduced

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:02.790
to WordPress.

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:06.620
She spoke at her first WordPress
Camp, WordCamp Miami, in 2017.

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:10.540
And between 2015 to
2019, she built websites,

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:13.270
and provided WordPress
support independently

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:15.230
under the name Pixel
Glow Web Design.

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:18.580
She had spent time providing plugin
support at [Inaudible 00:01:17]

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:21.880
WP, being a speaker and
master for GoDaddy Pro,

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.370
leading the community team
at WP [Inaudible 00:01:23],

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:26.690
and producing digital
content from MasterWP.

00:01:27.733 --> 00:01:31.970
She currently owns Beedia Productions
LLC, where she provides editing,

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.780
voiceover, and production services
to companies like PINSA [phonetic]

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:36.780
and WP101.

00:01:37.653 --> 00:01:39.590
She's an instructor of
WordPress Essentials Course

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:41.260
on LinkedIn Learning.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.650
And through Beedia, Allie uses
her knowledge of WordPress

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:44.850
to teach others how to use it.

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.900
Please feel free to add your
questions in the Zoom Q&A session,

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.400
and we'll answer them all
at the end of the session.

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.410
Use the chat to connect
with other attendees.

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:58.410
Allie, the virtual floor is yours.

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:03.230
 ALLIE NIMMONS: Thank
you, Amanda.

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:06.680
Wow, I forgot that I provided
my long bio for this.

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:07.350
[chuckles]

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.250
Thank you for that
amazing introduction.

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:11.430
I'm so happy to be here.

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.630
I'm so happy to be
speaking with you all.

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:19.800
Accessibility Beyond Blindness.
On screen here,

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:29.260
bit.ly/abbwpa is actually a link
to these slides if you'd like

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.090
to follow along with me.

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.130
If that's easier for you, the access
to those slides are right there.

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:41.870
And I'll be providing some links
later on in the talk as well,

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:43.520
and the links are going
to be in those slides.

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.080
So if that's helpful for you,
please go ahead and jump in.

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.760
Also, I'm including the hashtags
for the event on every slide.

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.000
Please use those hashtags on
whatever social media you might be on

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
and post about this event.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.600
I would thank the organizers.

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:06.130
This is such a fantastic event,
and I'm so proud to be a part of it.

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:12.630
If there's any takeaways that you
grabbed from this talk, please share.

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:16.080
If there's any slides that you
want to screenshot and share,

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.840
please go ahead and
do that as well.

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.880
I absolutely do not mind.

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.570
I'm not huge on social media at
the moment, so you don't need

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:26.380
to tag me or anything,
but make sure to tag the event.

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:34.270
I currently teach about WordPress.

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:37.450
That is what I spend the
majority of my time doing,

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:40.180
and I provide tools
and resources to try

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:43.040
to help the tech
space be more diverse.

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:47.200
I started building websites in
2015, like was previously said.

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:53.830
And in that time, I pretty definitely
launched more inaccessible websites

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:55.640
than accessible websites.

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:01.480
I can say for certain that the
first few years of my education

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.089
as a web designer and developer,

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:05.200
I was not keeping
accessibility in mind.

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:09.060
It wasn't something that I was really
aware of, or that was on my radar.

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:14.990
But as I've learned and as I've
built and, developed, and launched,

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:19.680
and broken, and troubleshot,
migrated, and maintained

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.720
so many different WordPress sites,
it's something that I've learned

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:28.740
so much more about through osmosis,
or on my own independently.

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:32.630
And it’s something that's
become really important to me,

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:36.730
because the more websites I see and
the more I learn, the more I learn

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:39.910
that those websites tend
not to be accessible.

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:45.540
So the education about
accessibility is something

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:48.360
that I've become passionate about,
as well as supporting people,

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.030
like the people who run this
event, who spend most

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:53.270
of their time educating
people about accessibility.

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:55.480
I believe it’s
incredibly important.

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:59.890
That being said,
I'm not an expert in accessibility.

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:00.780
I'm very self-taught.

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:02.480
I have no formal training.

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:04.210
I don't consult
about accessibility.

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:07.200
I don't have an agency that
focuses on accessibility.

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:10.160
So I will probably get
a few things wrong.

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:11.230
I really hope not.

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:13.500
I'm going to try my best.

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:15.950
I'm always just doing my best.

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:20.610
But that also means that I
welcome any and all corrections.

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:24.790
If I make any mistakes, please let
me know so that I can know better,

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:28.380
so I can do better,
and so I can educate others better.

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:34.100
I think it's kismet that my name is
Allie, which is so close to Ally.

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:37.650
I am a huge proponent of allyship
[phonetic], particularly in tech.

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:40.280
If you've met me before,
interacted with me before,

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:42.200
that is kind of my brand.

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:45.890
And I try to be as intersectional
about that as I possibly can,

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:50.590
which means that my allyship
includes anyone who can use it,

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:54.770
and that definitely includes the
umbrella of web accessibility.

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:58.760
I am not very active on social
media, like I said,

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:00.770
but I am pretty active on LinkedIn.

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:02.476
You can just search
my name on LinkedIn

00:06:02.477 --> 00:06:03.840
if you'd like to connect there.

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:07.730
I know I already had an offer
for a new friend on LinkedIn.

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:10.380
Fun fact: I am actually
in the LinkedIn offices

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:13.430
in Southern California right now
recording a course with them.

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:16.060
They were kind enough to give
me a break in my recording time

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:17.950
to come be here with you.

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:20.030
So shout out to LinkedIn.

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:25.050
Of course, this is a WordPress
talk, so I had to put a picture

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:27.390
of myself on my
little about screen.

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:30.250
I also, like, just decided to flex
that I met LeVar Burton recently

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:34.690
because no other picture of
me is as cool as this picture.

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:38.980
And I did definitely try
to work in Geordi La Forge

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:42.870
into this presentation,
given that he is a blind character

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:46.160
that LeVar Burton played,
but it never really fit.

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:48.360
So after this talk,
if you can think of a way

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:52.060
that I could have incorporated
Geordi La Forge into this talk,

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:53.580
please let me know in
case I do it again.

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:55.240
All right.

00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:59.550
So who is this talk for?

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:00.920
What are we talking about?

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:08.650
In my experience thus far,
in my education about accessibility,

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:13.160
but also speaking to other
people about accessibility,

00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:16.910
there is what I believe to
be a huge misconception.

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:22.570
And I'm sure most of you will
agree with me that the job

00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:28.070
of accessibility in terms of website,
application, design lies in code,

00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:30.460
what that software looks like,
what that code looks like,

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:31.790
how it's written.

00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:34.890
And design; what the website looks
like on the front-end, the colors,

00:07:34.890 --> 00:07:37.660
the fonts,
all of those sorts of things.

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:41.960
And the misconception is that
that's where that work ends,

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:45.430
and that's completely false, right?

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:49.170
But that is what a lot of
people go through life thinking.

00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:54.380
Although, we wouldn't really
be talking about the breadth

00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:59.350
of accessibility if we're not talking
about the content on a website.

00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:03.610
If that content that is being
written, whether it is written

00:08:03.610 --> 00:08:06.950
or whether it's visual, if that
content is accessible to everyone

00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:07.950
who's using that site.

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:14.310
If you are somebody who works in
social media, accessibility needs

00:08:14.310 --> 00:08:15.920
to be a part of your process.

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:19.870
If you are somebody who works
in marketing, who strategizes,

00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:22.290
accessibility needs to
be part of that process.

00:08:22.290 --> 00:08:26.390
Even things like speed and
security have a lot of overlap

00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:32.820
in terms of prioritizing, making
sure that their site is accessible.

00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:39.350
HR, like,
if you work at all on a website,

00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:41.770
accessibility is
your responsibility.

00:08:41.770 --> 00:08:47.430
I won't be talking a lot about event
accessibility in this presentation,

00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:52.150
even though WordPress event
accessibility is an enormous issue,

00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:54.320
and it's very important,
and it needs a lot of work.

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:59.020
I wanted to keep this focused
specifically to websites, but tons

00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:01.310
of this information
is going to overlap.

00:09:01.310 --> 00:09:04.970
So if you are anyone who works on
a website, if you have a website,

00:09:04.970 --> 00:09:07.990
if you manage a website,
if you add content to a website,

00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:11.870
if you maintain a website, if you
optimize websites, there’s a lot

00:09:11.870 --> 00:09:12.870
in here for you.

00:09:17.170 --> 00:09:24.620
I believe that our perception
of accessibility is also limited

00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:31.110
in terms of who it is that we are
making a website accessible for.

00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:34.280
Especially if you are new to
the realm of accessibility,

00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:37.930
your preconceived notions about
who you're solving problems

00:09:37.930 --> 00:09:40.550
for might be very limited; and
that might not be your fault,

00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:43.630
because the representation
that we do see in terms

00:09:43.630 --> 00:09:48.400
of accessibility tends to include
people with physical disabilities.

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:50.860
What you're seeing on
the screen right now

00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:53.800
are the first seven image
results when I searched

00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:57.530
on a particular stock
website’s accessibility.

00:09:57.530 --> 00:10:00.930
And all of these images
feature people in wheelchairs,

00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:04.540
they feature people who are blind, or
who are using assistive technology.

00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:11.980
And It's not just people in
wheelchairs or people who are blind

00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:14.080
that need accessible
websites, right?

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:17.350
But that is sort of the story
that's being told in a lot

00:10:17.350 --> 00:10:21.133
of the content that we see online

00:10:21.133 --> 00:10:23.470
when we're learning
about accessibility.

00:10:23.470 --> 00:10:27.440
So when we discuss
accessibility solutions

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:30.340
when we have this preconceived
notion, we've already decided

00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:32.780
what the problems are, right?

00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:35.440
Before you build anything, no matter
what it is that you're building,

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:37.850
whether it's something virtual
or something physical, you have

00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:41.770
to know what the problems are
that you're trying to solve,

00:10:41.770 --> 00:10:44.550
and I think all of us
can identify with that.

00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:48.450
Chances are, within your job,
you are a problem solver.

00:10:48.450 --> 00:10:51.660
Isn’t that what we do when we
write, develop software?

00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:54.170
When we engineer something,
when we market to people,

00:10:54.170 --> 00:10:55.970
we're trying to solve a problem.

00:10:55.970 --> 00:10:58.210
We already know how to do this.

00:10:58.210 --> 00:11:01.640
We are already familiar with
the Identify the problem,

00:11:03.510 --> 00:11:07.020
and find the methods
to solve the problem.

00:11:08.050 --> 00:11:09.732
When it comes to
website accessibility,

00:11:09.733 --> 00:11:10.910
I believe that we just sort

00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:16.080
of have to expand that scope in
order to find the appropriate methods

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:17.930
to solve the right problems
for the right people.

00:11:21.070 --> 00:11:23.940
So who does accessibility benefit?

00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:28.000
The short answer is
accessibility benefits everybody.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.390
The whole point of this,
Accessibility Beyond Blindness,

00:11:31.390 --> 00:11:35.540
is accessibility doesn't just
benefit blind or low vision people

00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:37.410
who are accessing your
website, which is kind

00:11:37.410 --> 00:11:39.880
of what that
conception tends to be.

00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:45.570
When I'm speaking about disabilities
in this talk, I'm talking

00:11:45.570 --> 00:11:48.730
about both permanent and
temporary disabilities.

00:11:48.730 --> 00:11:53.250
And in this case, a disability
is something that makes it harder

00:11:53.250 --> 00:11:56.160
for you to achieve a
goal the way a person

00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:58.910
without that disability
would achieve that goal.

00:11:58.910 --> 00:12:02.790
For example, if I'm on a
website and there's a button

00:12:02.790 --> 00:12:06.210
that's supposed to go to another
page, and I click on that button

00:12:06.210 --> 00:12:10.390
and it doesn't work,
it just is broken, that is a problem

00:12:10.390 --> 00:12:11.490
that affects everyone.

00:12:11.490 --> 00:12:13.910
It doesn't matter what disability
I may have or not have,

00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:17.210
it doesn't matter my access,
it doesn't matter my education.

00:12:17.210 --> 00:12:17.810
It's broken.

00:12:17.810 --> 00:12:20.790
That affects everyone
in the same way.

00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:26.700
However, if that button has
really unclear anchor text

00:12:28.610 --> 00:12:31.770
that just says, you know,
Click here for more.

00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:37.010
Perhaps somebody who is
neurotypical might be able

00:12:37.010 --> 00:12:41.210
to put various pieces of that
page together and figure out

00:12:41.210 --> 00:12:43.790
where that button goes,
and feel confident in being able

00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:46.330
to click that button to
get to the next step.

00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:48.880
There are people who will
really struggle with that

00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:52.480
and not feel confident in
clicking that button to understand

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:53.550
where it goes.

00:12:53.550 --> 00:12:56.630
So now we've created
a rift in terms of

00:12:56.630 --> 00:12:59.740
what some people are struggling
with and what some people aren't.

00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:02.030
We've solved one problem and we
haven't solved another problem.

00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:09.090
So lots of people benefit
from accessibility, right?

00:13:09.090 --> 00:13:11.170
And this is definitely
not a comprehensive list.

00:13:11.170 --> 00:13:18.320
I'm sure there's examples that I am
missing, but these are people that,

00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:22.860
in my experience, tend to get
overlooked when we are strategizing

00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:23.880
about accessibility.

00:13:25.410 --> 00:13:28.220
Neurodivergent people
benefit from accessibility.

00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:30.460
And when I'm talking about
neurodivergence, if you don't know

00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:34.670
what that term means, being
neurodivergent means having a brain

00:13:34.670 --> 00:13:40.410
that works differently from the
average or neurotypical person.

00:13:40.410 --> 00:13:42.680
This might be differences
in social preferences.

00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:44.040
This might be ways of learning.

00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:45.560
This might be ways
of communicating.

00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:48.820
And it might be ways of
perceiving your environment.

00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:52.400
Examples of neurodivergent,
again, not a comprehensive list,

00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:56.030
could be people with attention
deficit disorders, ADHD,

00:13:56.030 --> 00:13:59.170
people with severe anxiety,
people with epilepsy.

00:13:59.170 --> 00:14:02.590
Epilepsy is considered
a neurodivergence.

00:14:02.590 --> 00:14:06.270
People who are autistic on the
spectrum, as you might say.

00:14:06.270 --> 00:14:10.000
Anyone with a mental disability,
a cognitive impairment,

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.460
or a mental illness
that is strong enough

00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:15.700
that affects that person enough
to affect their use of a website.

00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:18.700
These are all people that we
need to be thinking about.

00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:20.684
Now, you might be
thinking to yourself,

00:14:20.685 --> 00:14:22.320
Well, I'm not an expert in ADHD.

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:23.760
I'm not an expert in autism.

00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:29.990
How am I supposed to anticipate
those needs? It doesn't take a lot

00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:37.990
to do some research into how
experiences can be challenging online

00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:41.820
for people with neurodivergence,
and a lot of it comes down

00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:44.330
to clarity and choice.

00:14:44.330 --> 00:14:51.600
So content that is hard or
impossible to ingest, user journeys

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:55.545
that are stressful,
flashing or automatic movement

00:14:55.546 --> 00:14:58.233
that can't be paused
or interacted with,

00:15:00.267 --> 00:15:02.950
all of these things
can affect people

00:15:02.950 --> 00:15:06.120
with neurodivergence, and make
using a website very difficult.

00:15:07.290 --> 00:15:09.660
And there is a challenge in
that, which is that

00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:16.870
if you are a neurotypical person,
you have, I have an unconscious bias.

00:15:16.870 --> 00:15:17.840
I will make assumptions,

00:15:17.841 --> 00:15:19.860
you will make assumptions
as I create a website,

00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:22.830
as you create a website
that you will be understood,

00:15:22.830 --> 00:15:27.810
that you will make decisions
about communicating information

00:15:27.810 --> 00:15:29.460
in ways that you understand.

00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:34.610
And there are many people out
there who don't follow that

00:15:34.610 --> 00:15:36.370
same thought process.

00:15:36.370 --> 00:15:39.450
So taking the time to understand
that, and taking the time

00:15:39.450 --> 00:15:45.970
to make sure that information
is as clear and concise

00:15:45.970 --> 00:15:48.970
as possible is incredibly
important, and we'll go over,

00:15:48.970 --> 00:15:50.430
a little bit later, some ways

00:15:50.430 --> 00:15:51.430
in which we can do that.

00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:57.390
Accessibility also benefits
people with learning disabilities.

00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:02.480
A very common example of that
is dyslexia, which makes it hard

00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:04.450
for you to read.

00:16:04.450 --> 00:16:07.350
People with dyslexia often
find that words move around,

00:16:07.350 --> 00:16:09.990
or letters move around,
or words might appear backwards,

00:16:09.990 --> 00:16:11.110
and so on and so forth.

00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:16.530
And a lot of fonts can make
dyslexia worse, can make it harder

00:16:16.530 --> 00:16:19.160
for someone with dyslexia
to read something.

00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:23.470
So If you are publishing
content on the internet,

00:16:23.470 --> 00:16:29.710
it doesn't take a lot to research
what fonts are stronger choices

00:16:29.710 --> 00:16:30.860
for people with dyslexia.

00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:34.350
When we're talking about
learning disabilities,

00:16:34.350 --> 00:16:36.890
we might also be talking
about simply people

00:16:36.890 --> 00:16:40.620
for whom English is not
their first language.

00:16:42.310 --> 00:16:46.440
And that's not to say that
person can't understand English,

00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:51.370
but there might be language on
your website that is so localized

00:16:51.370 --> 00:16:57.420
to English, to America, or parts of
Europe that maybe somebody coming

00:16:57.420 --> 00:17:00.740
from Japan or somebody coming
from Portugal is not going

00:17:00.740 --> 00:17:04.310
to understand, and we'll go
over some of those idioms later.

00:17:04.310 --> 00:17:11.270
So just keeping in mind that we
want to create the shortest point

00:17:11.270 --> 00:17:13.690
of contact between
what somebody has to do

00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:17.770
and how they can reach their goal.

00:17:17.770 --> 00:17:22.490
And so providing as few steps
as possible on our websites,

00:17:22.490 --> 00:17:28.400
and that includes making it so
that they can read the information

00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:31.100
and understand it clearly.

00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:32.790
All of that is
incredibly important.

00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:39.300
So these are sort of what I
consider internal factors.

00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:41.720
These are things about a
person, about their

00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:46.030
being that might make it challenging
for them to access your website.

00:17:46.030 --> 00:17:47.850
Some external factors.

00:17:47.850 --> 00:17:49.437
People with poor
internet connections;

00:17:49.438 --> 00:17:50.820
and that doesn't just mean people

00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:53.560
that are in impoverished
areas who don't have access

00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:55.430
to high-speed internet.

00:17:55.430 --> 00:18:02.080
That could mean that your user
is at a university library,

00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:06.080
and it's finals week,
and everyone is hogging the Wi-Fi.

00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:07.790
It could mean that
they're at a coffee shop,

00:18:07.790 --> 00:18:11.490
and that coffee shop just has
cheap Wi-Fi and isn't able

00:18:11.490 --> 00:18:18.040
to load your website as quickly
as you a website builder

00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:23.300
or business owner who pays extra for
high-speed Wi-Fi might experience.

00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:28.440
And once sites are slow to load,
they tend to load minimal content.

00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:30.890
And so this is where site
speed comes into effect

00:18:30.890 --> 00:18:33.530
when we're talking about
accessibility; a good example of that

00:18:33.530 --> 00:18:35.460
being alternative text.

00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:39.310
If your user has a poor
internet connection, the images

00:18:39.310 --> 00:18:41.990
on your site may not load,
or may not load as quickly.

00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:46.820
And if you have strong alternative
text on that page, they don't need

00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:49.910
to worry about the information
they might be missing

00:18:49.910 --> 00:18:51.120
when they can't see that image.

00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:55.467
We're also talking about
mobile-device users;

00:18:55.468 --> 00:18:56.680
and that's not necessarily

00:18:56.680 --> 00:19:01.340
just to say when you talk
about responsivity, we need

00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:05.820
to talk about people who
are using older devices.

00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:10.050
My dad just got rid of his
flip phone about a year

00:19:10.050 --> 00:19:12.910
and a half ago, and that man was
trying to access the internet

00:19:12.910 --> 00:19:13.970
on his flip phone.

00:19:13.970 --> 00:19:16.570
So please think about
my dad [laughs].

00:19:16.570 --> 00:19:20.820
Please think about people
who are using older devices;

00:19:20.820 --> 00:19:23.510
devices that are not
iPhones or Android phones.

00:19:25.190 --> 00:19:27.670
Sometimes people just don't
have access to those devices,

00:19:27.670 --> 00:19:29.970
and so we need to keep those people
in mind when we're looking at,

00:19:31.850 --> 00:19:34.570
How simple can we make it
to access this website?

00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:39.090
We're looking at people
who have limited mobility.

00:19:39.090 --> 00:19:44.510
And that could be a permanent
limitation, a missing arm,

00:19:44.510 --> 00:19:46.120
a missing hand, a missing fingers.

00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:49.640
That makes it really hard to
use a keyboard or use a mouse

00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:51.460
to interact with your site.

00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:54.090
They may have arthritis
and not really be able

00:19:54.090 --> 00:20:00.580
to scroll through a website as much
as we think they should be able to.

00:20:00.580 --> 00:20:07.100
I'm trying to get you thinking
about the wide variety of people

00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:11.630
and circumstances outside of
what we normally consider.

00:20:11.630 --> 00:20:16.880
When we know the problem,
we can anticipate a solution, right?

00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:20.040
Even when I think about limited
mobility... Have you ever tried

00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:26.080
to navigate a website while holding
a screaming, crying, wiggling baby?

00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:30.610
There are so many times in
your life where your ability

00:20:30.610 --> 00:20:34.950
to navigate something is
challenged or taken away from you,

00:20:34.950 --> 00:20:38.240
and that can be temporary
or that can be permanent.

00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:39.240
I'm going to take a sip of water.

00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:47.150
So this last bullet point...
Just hear me out.

00:20:47.150 --> 00:20:52.080
Recently, I was in a grocery store,
and I already had a cart full

00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:54.210
of heavy things,
and it was the end of the day

00:20:54.210 --> 00:20:56.080
and I was tired,
and I didn't want to be there,

00:20:56.080 --> 00:20:59.240
and I don't like going to the grocery
store, but I was there anyway.

00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:04.790
And I was on my phone,
looking at a website for a recipe

00:21:04.790 --> 00:21:06.286
that I wanted to
make, and I was trying

00:21:06.287 --> 00:21:07.520
to find the list of ingredients.

00:21:08.710 --> 00:21:13.500
If you've ever tried to access
a recipe, like go on Pinterest

00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:16.620
and find a recipe, and click through
and go to that person's blog,

00:21:16.620 --> 00:21:19.890
you know the challenges that
tend to come with those pages.

00:21:19.890 --> 00:21:25.560
I was forced to scroll all
the way down to the bottom

00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:30.010
of this enormous blog post in order
to actually find the recipe itself,

00:21:30.010 --> 00:21:33.140
because this person wanted to tell
me a story about their grandmother,

00:21:33.140 --> 00:21:35.700
or, I don't know,
something completely irrelevant

00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:37.100
to what I needed.

00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:43.390
So I'm trying to scroll and
the page is packed with ads:

00:21:43.390 --> 00:21:47.160
banner ads, inline ads, pop-up ads.

00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:51.680
And so every time I try to scroll,
I'm accidentally tapping on ads.

00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:55.920
And the second an ad opens,
I have to try to find the little X

00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:59.060
to close out of that ad, and
usually they make them incredibly,

00:21:59.060 --> 00:21:59.920
incredibly tiny.

00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:03.380
And so I'm trying to angle my
hand to get the right pressure

00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:07.020
to get the tiny X; and usually I
don't, so I end up actually tapping

00:22:07.020 --> 00:22:07.890
on the ad itself.

00:22:07.890 --> 00:22:10.680
And now I need to go all the
way to the top-left corner

00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:12.160
of my phone to try to go back.

00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:16.560
So I'm stressed out [chuckles], OK?

00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:21.240
There are so many ads and they
won't stop, and I'm scrolling

00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:22.190
and scrolling.

00:22:22.190 --> 00:22:25.890
I finally get to a video, and I
think, Great, they made a video

00:22:25.890 --> 00:22:26.600
about this recipe.

00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:29.890
I'll just open up the video.
There are no captions on the video.

00:22:29.890 --> 00:22:33.400
I'm sorry, I'm not the kind of
person that will play the audio

00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:34.780
of a video in the
middle of a Target.

00:22:34.780 --> 00:22:37.750
I can't do that.

00:22:37.750 --> 00:22:41.920
The video would have been great
to just see what she was using

00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:44.010
and go ahead and grab it,
but there were no captions

00:22:44.010 --> 00:22:45.090
to this video so I had to go back.

00:22:46.710 --> 00:22:52.610
I finally get to the recipe,
but the Wi-Fi connection

00:22:52.610 --> 00:22:59.340
in this Target is middling,
and so the ads are still populating.

00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:02.650
The ads from higher up on
the page are still loading.

00:23:02.650 --> 00:23:05.430
So I get to the recipe list,
and then it shoots down

00:23:05.430 --> 00:23:08.630
because an ad has populated and
forced the content down the page.

00:23:11.290 --> 00:23:13.910
I didn't make the dang recipe.

00:23:13.910 --> 00:23:14.520
[laughs]

00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:15.800
I never made it.

00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:21.510
I gave up, because it was so
impossible for me, an able-bodied,

00:23:21.510 --> 00:23:26.723
a neurotypical person,
with no necessarily challenges

00:23:26.724 --> 00:23:31.470
to my mobility, no learning
disabilities, no disability

00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:33.250
to use this website.

00:23:36.180 --> 00:23:39.820
These are the kinds of things that
we have to keep in mind, right?

00:23:39.820 --> 00:23:42.510
That yes,
we are designing websites.

00:23:42.510 --> 00:23:43.590
We are building websites.

00:23:43.590 --> 00:23:45.110
We are creating solutions.

00:23:46.970 --> 00:23:50.050
And we are keeping people
with disabilities in mind,

00:23:50.050 --> 00:23:52.360
but that's not where the work ends.

00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:56.550
There are so many things that this
particular website could have done

00:23:56.550 --> 00:23:58.270
to improve my experience.

00:23:58.270 --> 00:24:00.710
Lots of recipe sites
will now have a jump

00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:03.330
to recipe button at the very
top, which you just tap,

00:24:03.330 --> 00:24:06.310
and it brings you all the
way down to the recipe.

00:24:06.310 --> 00:24:07.840
That's great.

00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:09.910
I don't really understand why
you can't just put the recipe

00:24:09.910 --> 00:24:12.770
at the top of the
page above the fold.

00:24:12.770 --> 00:24:15.480
Why do I have an extra
step in my user journey?

00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:20.780
And then when I do click that button,
those ads are still populating.

00:24:20.780 --> 00:24:24.230
So I get to the recipe,
and then I'm forced away from it.

00:24:26.130 --> 00:24:27.880
It's incredibly stressful.

00:24:28.910 --> 00:24:31.950
And these are the things that
we have to be thinking about.

00:24:31.950 --> 00:24:37.970
About that person at 6:30 at Target
who's just trying to figure out

00:24:37.970 --> 00:24:40.050
if they need [Inaudible 00:24:39]

00:24:40.050 --> 00:24:41.050
or not.

00:24:43.950 --> 00:24:45.840
So we’ve talked a lot about people.

00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:49.670
The people beyond blind folks and
people in wheelchairs that we want

00:24:49.670 --> 00:24:52.720
to think about when we are
optimizing for accessibility.

00:24:54.140 --> 00:24:56.810
If you want to take all the
altruism out of it and get

00:24:56.810 --> 00:25:01.210
to the business side of things,
like, How does focusing more

00:25:01.210 --> 00:25:06.100
on accessibility help my website,
help my traffic, help my sales,

00:25:06.100 --> 00:25:11.850
help my business?
SEO and accessibility, in my mind,

00:25:11.850 --> 00:25:13.360
are in love with each other.

00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:14.420
They're a couple.

00:25:14.420 --> 00:25:15.210
They adore each other.

00:25:15.210 --> 00:25:18.660
There is so much overlap when
it comes to accessibility

00:25:18.660 --> 00:25:22.030
and SEO best practices,
because the goal is the same.

00:25:22.030 --> 00:25:26.030
The goal is to make sure that as
many people as humanly possible

00:25:26.030 --> 00:25:28.360
can easily use your website.

00:25:29.910 --> 00:25:33.420
Accessibility helps search-engine
algorithms understand

00:25:33.420 --> 00:25:36.400
your content better, and it
helps to improve searchability.

00:25:37.670 --> 00:25:40.979
Accessible websites are
just easier-to-use sites,

00:25:40.980 --> 00:25:46.360
and Google wants, loves to rank
sites that are easy to use, and sites

00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:51.760
that communicate that your site is
the best answer to someone's problem.

00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:55.180
You could have the best
product in the whole world

00:25:55.180 --> 00:25:59.050
to sell someone,
but if that site is inaccessible

00:25:59.050 --> 00:26:02.280
and doesn't communicate that
information to everyone,

00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:03.480
how is Google
supposed to know that?

00:26:05.820 --> 00:26:09.460
The more accessible your
site, the more it checks all

00:26:09.460 --> 00:26:11.250
of Google's boxes, right?

00:26:11.250 --> 00:26:14.760
If the site is easy to read and
uses headings and subheadings

00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:17.710
and bullet points,
if the images have clear

00:26:17.710 --> 00:26:22.150
and fantastic alternative text,
if the navigation is awesome

00:26:22.150 --> 00:26:25.890
and easy to use, if it's mobile
responsive, if it loads quickly,

00:26:25.890 --> 00:26:28.580
if it has high traffic
and low bounces,

00:26:28.580 --> 00:26:31.180
because people aren't abandoning
your site in the middle of a Target.

00:26:32.340 --> 00:26:36.850
All of these things are going
to help Google help you.

00:26:36.850 --> 00:26:39.710
So even if we want to take the
people out of it and just go after,

00:26:39.710 --> 00:26:42.650
Well, what do the robots think?
The robots want your site

00:26:42.650 --> 00:26:44.620
to be accessible, OK?

00:26:44.620 --> 00:26:49.540
This goes the same for other engines
and algorithms, not just Google.

00:26:49.540 --> 00:26:53.990
Videos with captions, as I just
complained about, are so much better.

00:26:53.990 --> 00:26:59.740
They perform better on social
media than ones without, right?

00:26:59.740 --> 00:27:02.770
That's kind of a definitive
thing of TikTok videos now,

00:27:02.770 --> 00:27:04.970
which is they have that
text that is, like,

00:27:04.970 --> 00:27:07.110
populating as the
person is speaking.

00:27:07.110 --> 00:27:08.130
Why?

00:27:08.130 --> 00:27:09.980
Because people like them.

00:27:09.980 --> 00:27:11.560
They watch them.

00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:12.430
They share them.

00:27:12.430 --> 00:27:14.370
They find them valuable.

00:27:14.370 --> 00:27:18.480
And so the algorithms will see
this, and then add value

00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:20.710
to that video and say, OK,
I'm going to push this video

00:27:20.710 --> 00:27:24.020
to more people because it's
accessible to them and they're going

00:27:24.020 --> 00:27:28.670
to be able to enjoy it.
Hear me out.

00:27:28.670 --> 00:27:32.060
I know this image is a complete
non-sequitur, [chuckles]

00:27:32.060 --> 00:27:33.250
but I have a point, OK?

00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:37.570
And I'm stealing this point
from my friend Michelle

00:27:37.570 --> 00:27:39.450
because she's talked about
it on her podcast before,

00:27:39.450 --> 00:27:40.930
and I think it's
extremely pertinent.

00:27:42.540 --> 00:27:46.070
In the ‘90s, there was a
fantastic show called Queer Eye

00:27:46.070 --> 00:27:50.870
for the Straight Guy.
It was a reality show about a group

00:27:50.870 --> 00:27:53.970
of gay men who would find a
straight guy and give him a whole,

00:27:53.970 --> 00:27:58.120
like, life makeover, like new clothes
and all of this kind of stuff.

00:27:58.120 --> 00:28:00.030
It was very wholesome,
and it was very sweet,

00:28:00.030 --> 00:28:05.740
and it was very groundbreaking
in terms of asking for tolerance

00:28:05.740 --> 00:28:07.110
for the gay community, right?

00:28:07.110 --> 00:28:13.070
Like showing gay people on TV,
helping other people, right?

00:28:13.070 --> 00:28:16.620
And the whole goal was
tolerance in a time

00:28:16.620 --> 00:28:19.760
when the queer community
was not tolerated.

00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:22.700
The show has recently got a reboot.

00:28:22.700 --> 00:28:23.860
It's fantastic.

00:28:23.860 --> 00:28:26.460
It's called Queer Eye.
That's the five people you're looking

00:28:26.460 --> 00:28:27.740
at right now.

00:28:27.740 --> 00:28:28.620
They're the hosts.

00:28:28.620 --> 00:28:29.620
I love this show.

00:28:31.570 --> 00:28:36.240
And their goal is acceptance;
not tolerance, but accepted.

00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:39.860
Because would you rather
be tolerated in a space,

00:28:39.860 --> 00:28:42.480
or would you rather be accepted?

00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:47.000
Would you rather feel that people
just aren't complaining about you,

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:49.350
or would you rather feel
that people want you there?

00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:55.960
So much of accessibility is
about inclusion; and inclusion is

00:28:55.960 --> 00:28:59.290
about making people feel like
you want them to be there.

00:28:59.290 --> 00:29:04.660
Why would you not want people to feel
like they belong on your website?

00:29:04.660 --> 00:29:08.600
Why would you not want people to
feel like going to your website,

00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:10.010
it's like it was made for them?

00:29:11.250 --> 00:29:13.470
You want them to be reading
your content, you want them

00:29:13.470 --> 00:29:15.980
to be buying your products,
or signing up for your services.

00:29:15.980 --> 00:29:17.770
That's what all this is
about, right?

00:29:17.770 --> 00:29:23.650
We design websites because
we want people to use them

00:29:23.650 --> 00:29:25.360
and do things with them.

00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:28.560
I stole this quote from UNC
Greensboro, I'll say that.

00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:32.505
Web accessibility works to
inclusively enable access

00:29:32.506 --> 00:29:38.767
to a website by all users, regardless
of the user's level of ability,

00:29:38.767 --> 00:29:40.930
condition,
or circumstances.

00:29:40.930 --> 00:29:46.810
And I love that the definition
has the word inclusive in it.

00:29:49.650 --> 00:29:52.720
I've heard people say this, including
those in the WordPress Community,

00:29:53.890 --> 00:29:58.110
that accessibility is an extra.

00:29:58.110 --> 00:29:59.750
It's an additional.

00:29:59.750 --> 00:30:04.800
It's just another service
to add on to a project.

00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:07.070
That it is pandering
to disabled people.

00:30:07.070 --> 00:30:08.650
That it's going the extra mile.

00:30:08.650 --> 00:30:09.350
I really disagree with that idea.

00:30:09.350 --> 00:30:10.410
It's not extra.

00:30:10.410 --> 00:30:12.910
It needs to be default, right?

00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:17.390
Or else you are intentionally
being exclusive.

00:30:19.540 --> 00:30:22.290
Inclusivity means
intersectionality, right?

00:30:22.290 --> 00:30:26.510
Like I mentioned earlier, which
means everything, all, everybody.

00:30:26.510 --> 00:30:29.670
Everybody is considered,
not just who we like to think of

00:30:29.670 --> 00:30:34.050
when we think of disabled people,
and not just the base best practices

00:30:34.050 --> 00:30:36.460
to make sure that a screen
reader can access the site.

00:30:36.460 --> 00:30:39.740
We need to be thinking about
everybody who is accessing the site

00:30:39.740 --> 00:30:41.590
in all different sorts of
ways, right?

00:30:44.010 --> 00:30:46.390
So that's a lot of
Allie's feelings.

00:30:46.390 --> 00:30:47.130
[chuckles]

00:30:47.130 --> 00:30:52.510
I'd like us to do a little
activity, kind of an audit.

00:30:52.510 --> 00:30:58.630
So I would like to challenge you
to, right now, open up a screen

00:30:58.630 --> 00:31:04.230
on your phone, on your computer,
and open up your website.

00:31:04.230 --> 00:31:08.150
It can be your personal website,
your blog, your business website,

00:31:08.150 --> 00:31:10.510
it could be a website you're
working on building right now,

00:31:10.510 --> 00:31:12.900
a website you've built for
somebody else in the past.

00:31:12.900 --> 00:31:13.510
Just pick one.

00:31:13.510 --> 00:31:15.170
Pick one that you like,
and that you're proud of.

00:31:17.420 --> 00:31:20.960
And we are going to check
some things together.

00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:24.110
And the goal of this
activity is not to shame you.

00:31:24.110 --> 00:31:26.510
It's not to say, Look at all
the things you didn't do.

00:31:26.510 --> 00:31:28.655
It's not to say,
Look how inaccessible your site is,

00:31:28.656 --> 00:31:29.840
boo-hoo to you,
right?

00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:33.100
Because I'm sure my website
would fail this test.

00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:38.220
As I was writing it, I was, like,
I should really go rehaul my website.

00:31:39.970 --> 00:31:44.060
This is not a comprehensive list
of things that your site should do

00:31:44.060 --> 00:31:48.070
or have or whatever, and it does not
include every single best practice.

00:31:48.070 --> 00:31:51.420
But I try to focus on the ones
that I feel like people miss out

00:31:51.420 --> 00:31:56.360
on a lot,
ones that I forget about a lot.

00:31:56.360 --> 00:32:00.270
So I would love for you to
have your site open with me

00:32:00.270 --> 00:32:06.440
and we'll go through these items
together, and I'll make sure

00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:08.920
that you all have the link again
to the slides in case you want

00:32:08.920 --> 00:32:09.670
to keep this list.

00:32:09.670 --> 00:32:11.450
There's this slide and
there's another slide.

00:32:11.450 --> 00:32:13.750
So we have two lists
to go through together.

00:32:13.750 --> 00:32:18.180
Now I just want you to click
through and I want you to try

00:32:18.180 --> 00:32:22.060
to make note of anything
that you've missed, anything

00:32:22.060 --> 00:32:26.040
that you haven't done,
and I would love for you to carry

00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:30.580
with you after this event is
over the action of going through

00:32:30.580 --> 00:32:31.830
and addressing these issues.

00:32:31.830 --> 00:32:34.540
Because we can sit here all day and
talk about how great accessibility is

00:32:34.540 --> 00:32:37.270
and how much we support it and
love it and blah-blah-blah.

00:32:37.270 --> 00:32:39.810
We need to then take action about
it, right?

00:32:39.810 --> 00:32:43.900
So if you have your site open
already, let's go over these items.

00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:49.890
Did you, before you launched
your site, test your site

00:32:49.890 --> 00:32:53.470
on a lower bandwidth than the
Wi-Fi connection you have now?

00:32:58.030 --> 00:33:00.760
OK, I need to phrase
this in a different way.

00:33:02.710 --> 00:33:05.160
Do you need to test
your site that way?

00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:08.580
Do you need to add any missing
alt text, or any alt text

00:33:08.580 --> 00:33:11.070
that is not using
inclusive language?

00:33:12.670 --> 00:33:15.130
Do you need to break up
chunks of content that's going

00:33:15.130 --> 00:33:17.510
to cause someone to scroll
and scroll and scroll forever?

00:33:18.520 --> 00:33:19.930
Do you need to adjust colors?

00:33:19.930 --> 00:33:23.310
Do you need to adjust colors
that are too low on contrast?

00:33:23.310 --> 00:33:26.380
And do you need to adjust colors that
are using too high of a contrast?

00:33:27.510 --> 00:33:32.850
Neon yellow on black is
fantastic for not being too low

00:33:32.850 --> 00:33:34.310
on the contrast scale, right?

00:33:34.310 --> 00:33:35.310
But it's way too high.

00:33:37.840 --> 00:33:40.620
Do you need to change
any images or icons

00:33:40.620 --> 00:33:43.110
that represent an idea
all alone by themselves?

00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:49.690
Images and icons always need to
complement whatever the more long

00:33:49.690 --> 00:33:51.140
form content is on that site.

00:33:52.170 --> 00:33:54.820
Do you have any videos that
you need to add captions to?

00:33:56.650 --> 00:34:00.120
Do you need to remove things
that move on their own

00:34:00.120 --> 00:34:02.800
or change automatically
without the user's input?

00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:08.670
Do you need to address any
unclear or sparse error messaging?

00:34:08.670 --> 00:34:13.350
So that means if something fails if
somebody is trying to fill out a form

00:34:13.350 --> 00:34:18.630
and it doesn't work, do you have
the proper language to tell them

00:34:18.630 --> 00:34:22.070
what to do without making an
assumption that they'll just know,

00:34:22.070 --> 00:34:24.600
Oh, I should go
back and start over?

00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:26.450
So I actually want
to give you a minute.

00:34:26.450 --> 00:34:32.270
Just for this page, I'll give you
a minute to comb through your site

00:34:32.270 --> 00:34:36.950
and make notes for yourself
of which of these tasks you

00:34:36.950 --> 00:34:37.640
might still need to do.

00:34:37.640 --> 00:34:40.500
And then we're going to
another one after this one

00:34:40.500 --> 00:34:44.040
where we'll do the same
thing, and then we'll wrap up.

00:34:45.320 --> 00:34:48.850
I know we're doing a Q&A after.

00:34:48.850 --> 00:34:50.740
I'm curious to look at the Q&A
now, though.

00:34:50.740 --> 00:34:54.500
I'm going to actually
look at the chat, then.

00:34:56.910 --> 00:34:58.030
I'm honestly scared
to look at the chat

00:34:58.030 --> 00:34:59.530
because I'm scared everyone's
going to be, like, [lightly]

00:34:59.530 --> 00:35:00.080
You’re wrong.

00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:04.030
This is all dumb.
I know you guys won't do that to me.

00:35:04.030 --> 00:35:07.510
I know you all won't do that to me.

00:35:07.510 --> 00:35:09.520
I'm really trying to
go back in the chat.

00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:12.890
And there's been so much
chat activity, I'm obsessed.

00:35:12.890 --> 00:35:16.530
That's the only thing I
notice about in-person events,

00:35:16.530 --> 00:35:18.190
which is immediate feedback.

00:35:21.540 --> 00:35:23.480
We're talking about Semantic HTML.

00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:24.833
I love that.

00:35:32.233 --> 00:35:32.869
[chuckles]

00:35:32.870 --> 00:35:33.450
Someone said, Yes.

00:35:33.450 --> 00:35:35.760
Mom of three.
Yes, I don't really know

00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:39.230
how you can navigate a
Pinterest recipe website

00:35:39.230 --> 00:35:43.260
with three babies vying
for your attention.

00:35:50.233 --> 00:35:51.210
I'm [Inaudible 00:35:50]

00:35:51.210 --> 00:35:52.020
about a lot of certifications.

00:35:52.020 --> 00:35:53.020
It's really interesting.

00:35:55.430 --> 00:35:57.230
I'm glad you like the
who-benefits list.

00:36:00.260 --> 00:36:02.620
Normalize getting rid of life
stories with recipes. [chuckles]

00:36:05.380 --> 00:36:06.210
You all are fun.

00:36:06.210 --> 00:36:09.260
Blame SEO for that.
Yes, I know exactly why they do it.

00:36:09.260 --> 00:36:11.590
And the thing is it works
because I find them all the time,

00:36:11.590 --> 00:36:13.150
but it's really awful.

00:36:13.150 --> 00:36:16.140
And so many ads.

00:36:16.140 --> 00:36:18.940
How much money do they make
through those ads, like, really?

00:36:23.196 --> 00:36:23.980
[laughs]

00:36:23.980 --> 00:36:26.480
All right, I think we're
about to start a coalition

00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:27.660
against recipe blocks.

00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:30.620
Everyone is so angry about
them, I love it.

00:36:37.300 --> 00:36:39.940
Oh, someone's talking about
how they broke their arm.

00:36:43.660 --> 00:36:47.890
Yes, really opened your eyes to
the challenge other people have

00:36:47.890 --> 00:36:48.890
to go through.

00:36:49.730 --> 00:36:52.900
And yes,
please do not use auto captions.

00:36:52.900 --> 00:36:55.520
I have so many feelings
and thoughts about that.

00:36:59.750 --> 00:37:03.380
Faye [phonetic], I am covered in
dog hair, so I identify with you.

00:37:04.590 --> 00:37:05.430
I don't use Instacart.

00:37:05.430 --> 00:37:07.910
I use something called Shipt,
which is basically the same thing.

00:37:07.910 --> 00:37:10.440
But that day, I had to just go
to the store because it was late.

00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:13.520
OK, I think we've done this list.

00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:21.500
If you want to screenshot
this, you totally can.

00:37:21.500 --> 00:37:24.700
Or we can add the link
to the slides again.

00:37:24.700 --> 00:37:30.230
And then we have this next list
to go through together as well.

00:37:30.230 --> 00:37:33.880
Oh, I am low on
time, it looks like.

00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:38.950
Do I need to stop and
answer questions instead?

00:37:38.950 --> 00:37:42.310
 AMANDA: You have a couple more
minutes if you want to finish up.

00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:44.540
 ALLIE: OK,
a couple more minutes.

00:37:44.540 --> 00:37:46.000
So please screenshot this list.

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:47.330
We'll go over it really
quickly together.

00:37:47.330 --> 00:37:49.730
I won't give you the couple of
minutes, though, because I want

00:37:49.730 --> 00:37:53.950
to make sure to reach the last
slide here before I do questions.

00:37:53.950 --> 00:37:57.840
Do you need to change colors to
communicate ideas in stronger ways?

00:37:57.840 --> 00:38:02.390
Green means go, red means stop.

00:38:02.390 --> 00:38:04.330
We got to make sure we're
using colors to communicate.

00:38:04.330 --> 00:38:07.490
If we're using a color,
try not to make it arbitrary.

00:38:07.490 --> 00:38:09.630
Do you need to add
subheadings to your content?

00:38:09.630 --> 00:38:10.630
Probably yes.

00:38:11.510 --> 00:38:13.980
Do you need to rewrite
unclear anchor text?

00:38:13.980 --> 00:38:15.740
Click here is not acceptable.

00:38:15.740 --> 00:38:17.080
We need better anchor text.

00:38:17.080 --> 00:38:19.690
I meant to do more
research on those.

00:38:19.690 --> 00:38:22.540
Do we need to add options for
people to be able to go back

00:38:22.540 --> 00:38:23.640
in their processes?

00:38:23.640 --> 00:38:24.880
That could be Breadcrumbs.

00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:26.730
That's a great example of that.

00:38:26.730 --> 00:38:28.420
Progress bars, things like that.

00:38:28.420 --> 00:38:36.420
You shouldn't have to rely purely
on your browser’s back button

00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:40.190
in order to go back
in your user journey.

00:38:40.190 --> 00:38:42.970
Do you need to test for
thumb first mobile design

00:38:42.970 --> 00:38:46.020
when you're using your
site on a website?

00:38:46.020 --> 00:38:49.600
How easy is it for your
thumb to work that site?

00:38:49.600 --> 00:38:53.630
Do you need to condense steps
from your user journeys?

00:38:53.630 --> 00:38:58.370
Is it taking your user 12
different decisions to get

00:38:58.370 --> 00:39:02.390
to where they have to go,
whereas it could take eight

00:39:02.390 --> 00:39:04.050
or six or three, right?

00:39:05.510 --> 00:39:07.490
Do you need to research
more helpful fonts?

00:39:07.490 --> 00:39:13.320
There are lists out there of fonts
that are specifically just better

00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:14.810
for people with
learning disabilities.

00:39:16.070 --> 00:39:19.670
Do you need to go through your
content to remove localized idioms

00:39:19.670 --> 00:39:23.750
or phrases, like, you know,
hit it out of the park, right?

00:39:23.750 --> 00:39:25.750
Somebody in a different country
doesn't know what baseball is;

00:39:25.750 --> 00:39:27.880
they don't know what
you're talking about.

00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:29.810
Do you need to remove
gendered language?

00:39:29.810 --> 00:39:33.610
We can have a whole other
discussion about gendered language,

00:39:33.610 --> 00:39:36.670
and inclusivity, and accessibility,
and how those things are combined,

00:39:36.670 --> 00:39:38.900
but I will not.

00:39:38.900 --> 00:39:40.460
We're going to move
on to the final slide.

00:39:40.460 --> 00:39:42.450
I did some resources for you all.

00:39:43.480 --> 00:39:46.690
If you use Yoast SEO, they have a
fantastic feature in their plugin

00:39:46.690 --> 00:39:50.790
that helps you check for inclusive
language on your website.

00:39:50.790 --> 00:39:54.240
If you need help approximating
different screen sizes,

00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:57.010
Browserstack.com,
fantastic website.

00:39:57.010 --> 00:39:57.930
I'm sure there are others.

00:39:57.930 --> 00:40:01.050
If there are that you know of,
please put them in the chat.

00:40:01.050 --> 00:40:05.280
If you go to a website and you're
like, Wow, this website is fantastic,

00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:07.740
it is accessible, it checks all
the boxes, it does all the things

00:40:07.740 --> 00:40:11.330
that I want to do, to snoop on
it, go to Builtwith.com,

00:40:11.330 --> 00:40:14.070
put the URL in there and it'll
tell you all the different tools

00:40:14.070 --> 00:40:16.440
and software that site uses.

00:40:16.440 --> 00:40:18.350
I have a blog post
where I list a bunch

00:40:18.350 --> 00:40:20.970
of diverse stock photography
sites so you can make sure

00:40:20.970 --> 00:40:22.270
that your imagery is inclusive.

00:40:24.740 --> 00:40:28.360
Hemingway is a fantastic browser
app that helps you to make sure

00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:32.280
that your content is as
easy to read as possible.

00:40:32.280 --> 00:40:36.860
It even has a feature that tells
you what the reading level,

00:40:36.860 --> 00:40:39.240
like, the grade level
is of your writing.

00:40:39.240 --> 00:40:43.570
So if you're writing at too high a
level, you can lower it a little bit

00:40:43.570 --> 00:40:46.680
to just make sure that more people
understand what you're talking about.

00:40:46.680 --> 00:40:51.090
Finally, I have been looking for
a WordPress plugin that can help

00:40:51.090 --> 00:40:52.380
with keyboard accessibility.

00:40:53.720 --> 00:40:56.910
Because I had a site recently that
I realized I couldn't tab through,

00:40:56.910 --> 00:41:01.580
and I don't know enough about code
to form a solution to that myself;

00:41:01.580 --> 00:41:03.360
and I was trying to find
a plugin and I couldn't.

00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:07.360
So I would love it if any of you all
have any suggestions in that regard.

00:41:08.590 --> 00:41:09.660
We're done.

00:41:09.660 --> 00:41:10.710
Let's go to the Q&A.

00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:16.720
 AMANDA: All right.

00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:20.070
Thanks, Allie, for your talk.

00:41:20.070 --> 00:41:24.590
Your examples were super relatable
to a lot of people in the chat.

00:41:24.590 --> 00:41:26.067
And I'm glad to
[Inaudible 00:41:26].

00:41:26.067 --> 00:41:26.667
[chuckles]

00:41:26.667 --> 00:41:27.900
It was awesome.

00:41:29.180 --> 00:41:32.350
Just a friendly reminder for folks
who haven't entered in your Q&A,

00:41:32.350 --> 00:41:36.320
you can put those in the
Q&A section in the chat.

00:41:36.320 --> 00:41:40.100
But I'm going to go ahead and
move on to the first question

00:41:40.100 --> 00:41:43.780
from Anonymous: What is your
advice for alt attributes

00:41:43.780 --> 00:41:46.630
and use of keywords in
the descriptive text?

00:41:48.610 --> 00:41:54.580
 ALLIE: My advice for alt text is
to pretend like you're sitting next

00:41:54.580 --> 00:42:00.680
to your blind grandmother and
you're describing pictures

00:42:00.680 --> 00:42:03.150
of her hometown from when
she was small to her.

00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:08.110
Be descriptive, be specific.

00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:15.840
As far as keywords are
concerned, if the content

00:42:15.840 --> 00:42:20.550
on your site is intentionally
chosen, you won't have to worry

00:42:20.550 --> 00:42:24.280
about making sure that you
have keywords in your alt text.

00:42:24.280 --> 00:42:27.290
Google is smart enough
to make the associations

00:42:27.290 --> 00:42:31.860
that if you have a
website for your bakery

00:42:31.860 --> 00:42:35.010
and you never say bakery in your
alt text, but you say muffins

00:42:35.010 --> 00:42:39.600
and cakes and cookies, it'll
understand what you're talking about.

00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:44.980
So I would say don't worry
necessarily too much about keywords,

00:42:44.980 --> 00:42:48.620
but make your descriptive text
and your alt text relevant

00:42:48.620 --> 00:42:52.770
and detailed enough that
the connections can be made.

00:42:57.500 --> 00:42:58.340
 AMANDA: Great.

00:42:58.340 --> 00:43:04.150
Next question is: Is there a specific
contrast ratio for ‘too high’?

00:43:05.971 --> 00:43:08.370
 ALLIE: I'm pretty
certain there is.

00:43:08.370 --> 00:43:10.590
I don't know off the top of my
head, but there are lots

00:43:10.590 --> 00:43:17.690
of tools online, like testers
and websites where you can input,

00:43:17.690 --> 00:43:20.530
like, two different hex values.

00:43:20.530 --> 00:43:23.970
And it'll tell you if
your yellow text is on top

00:43:23.970 --> 00:43:28.040
of your pink background,
the ratio is too high or too low.

00:43:29.730 --> 00:43:32.470
If that's incorrect,
someone please correct me.

00:43:32.470 --> 00:43:35.880
I know that it'll definitely
say when it is too low.

00:43:37.410 --> 00:43:39.910
I now can't remember if
it'll say if it's too high.

00:43:39.910 --> 00:43:44.540
But my advice would be to
look at a couple of those,

00:43:44.540 --> 00:43:47.470
like, testers and see
what it tells you.

00:43:48.433 --> 00:43:49.320
 AMANDA: So I saw a few.

00:43:49.320 --> 00:43:52.230
I saw WebAIM,
Pascall Group [phonetic]

00:43:52.230 --> 00:43:52.850
dropped in the chat.

00:43:52.850 --> 00:43:54.050
 ALLIE: WebAIM is
the one that I like.

00:43:54.050 --> 00:43:58.670
I just can't remember if it also
says if the contrast is too high.

00:43:58.670 --> 00:44:00.010
I know that it says
if it's too low.

00:44:01.033 --> 00:44:02.210
 AMANDA: No too high.

00:44:03.433 --> 00:44:04.770
 ALLIE: Oh, interesting.

00:44:05.980 --> 00:44:09.510
Well, then I guess just
use your common sense.

00:44:09.510 --> 00:44:09.880
I don't know.

00:44:09.880 --> 00:44:10.700
[chuckles]

00:44:10.700 --> 00:44:12.970
I just know that I've definitely
looked at things where I'm, like,

00:44:12.970 --> 00:44:18.390
That’s too bright.
Like, That neon color

00:44:18.390 --> 00:44:21.620
that you're using is too bright,
and it is upsetting to my eyes.

00:44:22.680 --> 00:44:25.810
So that might just be a
matter of showing it to people

00:44:25.810 --> 00:44:28.580
and asking them what they think.

00:44:28.580 --> 00:44:31.980
But yes, I guess the answer is
no, there isn't a specific ratio

00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:32.860
for too high.

00:44:36.607 --> 00:44:39.780
 AMANDA: All right, I'm just going
to roll on into the next question

00:44:39.780 --> 00:44:46.540
because there are a
lot of questions here.

00:44:46.540 --> 00:44:49.490
There’s a bullet point that
said, ‘Change images

00:44:49.490 --> 00:44:52.430
or icons that represent
an idea alone.’

00:44:52.430 --> 00:44:54.433
Are you able to clarify
that a bit more?

00:44:54.433 --> 00:44:55.500
 ALLIE: Yes.

00:44:56.567 --> 00:44:57.700
Let’s think of a good example.

00:45:07.067 --> 00:45:08.580
OK, one good example.

00:45:08.580 --> 00:45:12.520
Say you offer two services:
you offer coding services

00:45:12.520 --> 00:45:15.320
and you offer design services,
and you have a landing page

00:45:15.320 --> 00:45:18.670
where somebody can read about the
services, and then click on one

00:45:18.670 --> 00:45:22.310
of two buttons to either go learn
more about your coding services

00:45:22.310 --> 00:45:24.680
or learn more about
your design services.

00:45:24.680 --> 00:45:28.970
If you're coding services button,
instead of saying, Learn more

00:45:28.970 --> 00:45:32.680
about my coding services,
if it has, like, a bracket

00:45:33.700 --> 00:45:39.150
or some other symbol that represents
code, and that's what you're using

00:45:39.150 --> 00:45:42.810
to communicate that that's
what this button is for,

00:45:42.810 --> 00:45:44.440
that is not a strong choice.

00:45:46.380 --> 00:45:51.360
I'm not an expert in autism, but my
understanding is that many people

00:45:51.360 --> 00:45:54.150
who are neurodivergent
or on that spectrum have

00:45:54.150 --> 00:46:00.660
a hard time connecting a symbol to
a meaning for that symbol, right?

00:46:00.660 --> 00:46:03.510
So you're just
creating uncertainty.

00:46:03.510 --> 00:46:05.660
You’re creating a
little bit of confusion,

00:46:05.661 --> 00:46:07.060
whereas it's so much easier

00:46:07.060 --> 00:46:10.590
for you to just say
what that button is for.

00:46:10.590 --> 00:46:13.710
If you want to have that
symbol near the button

00:46:13.710 --> 00:46:17.940
or after the description, that's
great, that's fine, that's adorable.

00:46:17.940 --> 00:46:22.870
But using a symbol alone
to communicate a concept,

00:46:22.870 --> 00:46:26.460
especially a choice,
is not a strong idea,

00:46:26.460 --> 00:46:29.060
because you are isolating people
who would struggle to understand

00:46:29.061 --> 00:46:29.867
what that means.

00:46:34.220 --> 00:46:35.813
 AMANDA: Excellent example.

00:46:37.290 --> 00:46:38.440
Thank you, Allie.

00:46:39.470 --> 00:46:40.350
Next question.

00:46:40.350 --> 00:46:44.610
There's another in the Do
you need to... There’s a part

00:46:44.610 --> 00:46:48.890
about ...remove things that
move or change automatically.

00:46:48.890 --> 00:46:52.370
Does this include micro
animations, hover effects?

00:46:53.630 --> 00:46:56.840
Leah would love to learn more
about how these slight movements

00:46:56.840 --> 00:46:59.700
aren't accessible
to as many clients.

00:46:59.700 --> 00:47:00.433
 ALLIE: Yes.

00:47:01.750 --> 00:47:06.630
I would love for somebody whose
profession is accessibility

00:47:06.630 --> 00:47:09.640
to chime in here as well,
because I've heard kind

00:47:09.640 --> 00:47:16.570
of some dissenting opinions from...
To me, as somebody

00:47:16.570 --> 00:47:19.680
who does have anxiety and who does
end up in the middle of Target,

00:47:19.680 --> 00:47:24.320
not knowing what to do, if I'm
trying to find where I'm trying

00:47:24.320 --> 00:47:27.410
to go on your website, if I'm
trying to start my user journey

00:47:27.410 --> 00:47:32.650
or find the next step in my user
journey and things are moving

00:47:32.650 --> 00:47:37.000
and distracting my attention,
I'm distracted, right?

00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:38.600
And that's not what you want.

00:47:38.600 --> 00:47:42.180
I think something like a
hover animation is fine

00:47:42.180 --> 00:47:45.250
because my search is
already focused there.

00:47:45.250 --> 00:47:48.690
So if I touch something and it
moves, that's almost kind

00:47:48.690 --> 00:47:52.021
of an expected behavior,
so that's not really going

00:47:52.022 --> 00:47:53.430
to bother me as much.

00:47:53.430 --> 00:47:57.650
But if I'm reading some really
intent content, or I'm looking

00:47:57.650 --> 00:48:02.090
through a list of things, and this
other thing is hovering or moving

00:48:02.090 --> 00:48:05.740
or shaking, that's bothering
me, that's distracting me.

00:48:07.360 --> 00:48:11.440
So I would omit it as a designer.

00:48:11.440 --> 00:48:16.540
I would omit any movement that is not
directly helping the user accomplish

00:48:16.540 --> 00:48:17.540
what they're trying to do.

00:48:19.350 --> 00:48:21.360
I'm more than open,
though, to people

00:48:21.360 --> 00:48:24.140
in the chat arguing
back against that,

00:48:24.140 --> 00:48:26.330
because I'm sure there are things
I'm not thinking about there,

00:48:26.330 --> 00:48:31.402
but that's my reasoning
for minimizing movement

00:48:31.402 --> 00:48:32.750
as much as possible,

00:48:32.750 --> 00:48:35.328
especially if it's movement
that cannot be stopped

00:48:35.329 --> 00:48:38.560
and cannot be paused or cannot
be controlled in that way.

00:48:43.294 --> 00:48:44.040
 AMANDA: Thanks, Allie.

00:48:44.040 --> 00:48:46.887
There's a lot of
great recommendations,

00:48:46.888 --> 00:48:48.880
and people talking about it

00:48:48.880 --> 00:48:56.880
in the chat, so that might be
something to follow up on afterwards.

00:48:57.350 --> 00:49:00.450
We probably have time
for one more question.

00:49:02.460 --> 00:49:06.330
There's a question from Susan:
Is scrolling content the same

00:49:06.330 --> 00:49:07.450
as a long page?

00:49:07.450 --> 00:49:09.070
How would you break it up?

00:49:09.070 --> 00:49:10.380
I try and add headings.

00:49:10.380 --> 00:49:15.100
And if more than three or four,
I add a table of contents.

00:49:15.100 --> 00:49:16.795
Are those valid solutions?

00:49:18.200 --> 00:49:19.860
 ALLIE: A table of
contents is always going

00:49:19.860 --> 00:49:21.040
to be a valid solution.

00:49:22.990 --> 00:49:25.610
So when you're saying long
page, from what I understand,

00:49:25.610 --> 00:49:30.340
that’s like one of those
pages that's a lot of content,

00:49:30.340 --> 00:49:34.950
and you might be able to, like, use
an ID to jump to different sections.

00:49:34.950 --> 00:49:36.390
I think that's what
you're talking about.

00:49:36.390 --> 00:49:38.650
 AMANDA: I’m thinking
of, like, a recipe page,

00:49:38.650 --> 00:49:40.040
like you were talking
about earlier.

00:49:40.040 --> 00:49:41.040
 ALLIE: Yes.

00:49:42.090 --> 00:49:44.590
Always, always,
always table of contents.

00:49:44.590 --> 00:49:45.860
I love blog posts.

00:49:45.860 --> 00:49:48.070
I think Kinsta,
their blog does that really well.

00:49:48.070 --> 00:49:50.790
Like, they always have a table
of contents at the beginning

00:49:50.790 --> 00:49:52.860
that go to all of
their subheadings.

00:49:52.860 --> 00:49:55.940
I just think everyone should
do that no matter what,

00:49:55.940 --> 00:49:58.150
if you have subheadings on
that page and it makes sense.

00:50:00.520 --> 00:50:04.610
So yes, to answer your question,
those are very valid solutions.

00:50:04.610 --> 00:50:05.030
Yes.

00:50:05.030 --> 00:50:06.030
[chuckles].

00:50:08.910 --> 00:50:09.989
If we're out of time,

00:50:09.990 --> 00:50:12.660
I can type-answer the rest
of those Q&A questions,

00:50:12.660 --> 00:50:13.360
if that's cool?

00:50:15.367 --> 00:50:17.060
 AMANDA: I think that'd
be super appreciated.

00:50:17.060 --> 00:50:19.040
There are so many
great questions here.

00:50:19.040 --> 00:50:23.100
Your talk just sparked a lot
of ideas and interests, Allie.

00:50:23.100 --> 00:50:23.830
Wonderful.

00:50:23.830 --> 00:50:26.140
