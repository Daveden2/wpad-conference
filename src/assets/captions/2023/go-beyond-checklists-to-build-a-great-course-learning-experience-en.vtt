00:00:01.271 --> 00:00:04.961
>> AMBER HINDS: WordPress
Accessibility Day 2023.

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:09.040
Go Beyond Checklists to Build a
Great Course Learning Experience,

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:12.700
with speaker Sandi Gauder,
web developer and educator,

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:15.200

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.230
This presentation was
recorded September 27th, 2023.

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:22.040
>> BEN OGILVIE: All right.

00:00:23.722 --> 00:00:25.242
Hey, everyone.

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:31.470
Again, welcome or welcome back to
WordPress Accessibility Day 2023.

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.290
I'm Ben Ogilvie,
head of accessibility at Arc Touch.

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.280
We help companies of all sizes
create lovable custom apps, websites,

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.590
and connected experiences
used by hundreds of millions

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.060
of people every day.

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:45.860
I help our teams do that work with
an accessibility-first approach.

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:48.730
Thank you all so much for
joining Go Beyond Checklists

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:51.970
to Build a Great Course Learning
Experience with Sandi Gauder.

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:54.280
As a web accessibility specialist,
Sandi has been developing

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.360
modern accessible websites
for over 15 years.

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.410
She also coaches designers,
developers, and content producers

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:03.960
on best practices for meeting
web accessibility guidelines.

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.480
She has led workshops for
businesses, municipalities,

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.570
and web development firms on web
accessibility, and the Accessibility

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.760
for Ontarians with
Disabilities Act or AODA.

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.620
She has spoken at
conferences and appeared

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:16.730
at web accessibility
expert webinars.

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:19.380
Sandi has developed curriculum,
and taught web content

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.290
and social media accessibility
at Mohawk College as part

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.396
of the former Accessible
Media Production

00:01:24.397 --> 00:01:25.900
Graduate Certificate Program.

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.530
Management and technical
audiences welcome her clear,

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.400
common-sense approach.

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.960
During this session today,
please add your questions

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.657
in the Zoom Q&A section
and we'll answer them

00:01:35.658 --> 00:01:37.240
at the end of the session.

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.580
And you can also use the chat section
to connect with other attendees.

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:42.180
With that, I'll hand over to Sandi.

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:45.770
>> SANDI GAUDER: Thanks, Ben.

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.690
And thanks to everyone who has
welcomed me to join you here today.

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:54.740
I am going to get my
screen-sharing working here.

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:03.200
OK, can I get a thumbs up that
everyone's seeing that OK?

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:06.400
>> BEN: Not yet.

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:07.950
Black screen at the moment for me.

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.260
>> SANDI: Yes,
it says it's still loading.

00:02:13.344 --> 00:02:14.194
OK.

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.740
I don't have a song and dance
for you folks, I'm afraid.

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:17.150
[laughs]

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.090
I wasn't planning on technology.

00:02:19.091 --> 00:02:22.790
[Inaudible 00:02:20]

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:23.790
Yes.

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:30.400
I feel like I should be playing
the Jeopardy song right now.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.280
There we go.

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.400
OK, I'm seeing a bunch
of thumbs up floating,

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.850
so I think we are in business.

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:39.500
So let's get started.

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.590
What are we going to cover today?

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.930
Just in a nutshell, two things
that I want to talk about.

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.140
Look at some best practices for
creating accessible learning content,

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:59.590
and cover some basic principles of
UDL or Universal Design for Learning,

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.940
and how to apply UDL to
your learning content.

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.300
UDL is a big subject,
which is why we're just going

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:11.000
to be touching on some
of the very basics today.

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:17.860
Before we get into anything,
I want to do a quick poll.

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:23.990
So you can either take a snapshot
of the QR code on the screen,

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:26.210
and that should you
get you of the poll.

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:32.805
Or you can visit HTTPS, colon,
forward slash, forward slash, menti,

00:03:32.805 --> 00:03:43.219
M-E-N-T-I dot com slash
A-L-I-Z-H-9-P-5-J-I-5-B.

00:03:43.219 --> 00:03:47.850
And if somebody can drop that into
the chat, that would be super great.

00:03:47.851 --> 00:03:49.281
[chuckles]

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:51.130
So this is just
simply a quick poll.

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:53.460
What kind of organization
do you work for?

00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:00.670
Just take a couple of minutes to
answer that and then we'll move on.

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:12.866
And we should as people
start completing the poll

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:18.400
and I start seeing some of your
responses showing up on the screen.

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:23.700
So the five types of organizations,
education [Inaudible 00:04:23]

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:29.430
do you work for elementary
[Inaudible 00:04:27]

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:29.900
or secondary?

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:32.480
Is this a small business
or some other organization?

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:34.720
Maybe you’re a freelancer
or self-employed.

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:44.200
I suspect that my technology
is going to fail me here.

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:50.170
So let's imagine that people have
answered [Inaudible 00:04:48].

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:56.740
And the purpose of this is just
to get a sense of who is here,

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:00.350
what kind of organizations you're
working for, just to give a sense

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:02.060
for both you and me who's here.

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:04.480
But unfortunately, my technology
is not going to work for me,

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:08.150
so I'm just going to move right on.

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:14.350
When we talk about accessibility,
and digital accessibility,

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:18.750
or web accessibility, we really
need to think about the basics.

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:22.830
Many of the presenters today
have talked about WCAG,

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:25.971
the Web Content
Accessibility Guidelines,

00:05:25.972 --> 00:05:28.140
and that's really a good set

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:31.620
of guidelines to get started,
which is anything that has to do

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:33.430
with digital accessibility.

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:37.370
The principles are really sound,
and they're there to help guide us

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:42.130
on how to create accessible
content and accessible websites.

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:47.890
So if you are posting any kind
of learning content to WordPress,

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:52.820
start with an accessible WordPress
theme, if that's a given.

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:56.520
There are themes out there in
the repository that you can use.

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:59.940
And as long as you
maintain that theme,

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:02.580
and choose accessible
color combinations,

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:04.710
which I'm sure people have
talked about earlier today,

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:07.790
you're starting with
a good foundation.

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:11.840
It's also important to
organize your content.

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:15.920
Your learning content might be
in a Learning Management System;

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:19.610
it could be a recorded webinar,
like what we're doing today;

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:25.510
or it could be a series of pages on
a website that have content in them.

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:30.670
So to help all of our learners, it's
important to organize the content.

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:32.460
Use headings where
they're appropriate.

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:36.840
Use proper heading structure to
break up long chunks of text.

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:41.100
It really makes things a lot
easier for our learners to digest,

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:44.110
and it is a given.

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:47.320
If you've got images in your
content, make sure

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:50.370
that you include alternative
text for those images.

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:51.810
Be descriptive.

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:56.360
Make sure that you're explaining
what the picture is about.

00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:01.070
It doesn't need to be too wordy,
but it does need to convey the intent

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:03.630
of the image that you're
including in your content.

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:06.930
Of course, caption your videos.

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:09.400
Provide audio transcripts.

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:13.640
And don't just rely on
automated captioning.

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:17.030
They're a great place to start,
and can save you some time,

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:21.720
but make sure that you go back
and actually edit the captions

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:25.060
or the transcripts to make sure
they're accurate to what you've said

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:27.720
in any of your recorded content.

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:34.020
Even better, taking things
to an even higher level,

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:38.560
include audio description or
described video for all the audio

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:43.410
and video content,
or provide a described video text.

00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:47.500
I'm going to show you a bit
later in the session a couple

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:51.860
of examples of that, but really,
what it means is describing

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:55.910
what's happening on the screen for
somebody who can't see the screen.

00:07:55.910 --> 00:07:59.940
It could be because they're blind
and they can't see the screen,

00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:03.800
or maybe they're listening to your
content while they're cooking dinner

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:07.270
and they don't have the
screen in front of them.

00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:10.250
It can be helpful for a lot
of different users to describe

00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:12.350
what's actually
happening on the screen.

00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:19.080
We talked about using
alternative text for images,

00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:21.700
and that's an important
place to start.

00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:26.630
But it's also great if you can start
incorporating inclusive imagery

00:08:26.630 --> 00:08:27.630
in your content.

00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:34.390
Inclusive imagery includes
images that portray disability,

00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:37.700
and there's different
ways of doing that.

00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:43.150
There are more and more image
libraries out there that have images

00:08:43.150 --> 00:08:48.440
that are inclusive, and it's
important to try to incorporate that

00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:49.810
into your content.

00:08:49.810 --> 00:08:53.670
It doesn't need to be
in an inspiration form.

00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:57.990
You don't want to show people
with a disability and present them

00:08:57.990 --> 00:08:58.670
as heroes.

00:08:58.670 --> 00:09:02.230
You want to present them
in normal circumstances.

00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:05.100
Like the image that I've chosen
for this particular slide,

00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:08.980
it’s a gentleman
sitting on a bench.

00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:11.590
He's got his laptop open.

00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:14.660
He's got a cup of coffee sitting
next to him on the bench.

00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:17.440
And he just happens to
have a prosthetic leg.

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:22.080
So that's a nice way to
incorporate an inclusive image

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:26.000
without turning it into a hero.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.131
The other thing to think
about is this whole concept

00:09:29.132 --> 00:09:30.430
of the Scully Effect.

00:09:31.690 --> 00:09:35.680
There was a television show back
in the day called The X-Files.

00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:40.370
And it was a show
with two FBI agents,

00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:44.010
and one of them was a female
FBI agent named Scully.

00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:51.480
She was one of the first
women to be shown on TV

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:54.410
with a science background,
you know, quite intelligent

00:09:54.410 --> 00:09:56.090
and quite highly skilled.

00:09:57.370 --> 00:10:02.350
After that show aired, schools
were starting to notice that more

00:10:02.350 --> 00:10:07.880
and more women or young girls were
getting involved or interested

00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:11.260
in STEM Programs; science,
technology, engineering, and math.

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:16.240
They saw her doing it and they
thought, Well, if she can do it,

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:17.610
then I can do it.

00:10:17.610 --> 00:10:20.640
So it's now called
the Scully Effect.

00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:28.640
And it's when we see people like us,
it's easier for us to relate, right?

00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:34.530
And if we can relate, then we're
more likely to become more interested

00:10:34.530 --> 00:10:39.220
in the topic or interested in the
website or whatever the case may be.

00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:44.550
So see if you can find any
images that portray disabilities

00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:47.490
in a positive light,
and use them appropriately.

00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:54.830
Plain language.

00:10:54.830 --> 00:10:57.875
I think a couple of the
other presenters have touched

00:10:57.876 --> 00:10:58.890
on this a bit.

00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:04.190
Plain language is
important for learning,

00:11:04.190 --> 00:11:07.240
and it’s not about
dumbing down content.

00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:09.910
There's this misconception
that plain language is all

00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:20.480
about making things super simple, and
easier, or lowering the grade level.

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:24.540
And yes, we are trying to
get to a lower-grade level

00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:28.380
with our content, but it's not
about dumbing down content.

00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:32.070
It's about making it easier for
people to digest the content,

00:11:32.070 --> 00:11:35.000
understand the content,
and absorb the content.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.510
It helps make learning
much more effective.

00:11:37.510 --> 00:11:40.450
It helps make learning
much more efficient.

00:11:40.450 --> 00:11:47.070
Say you're presented
with two pieces of text.

00:11:47.070 --> 00:11:49.800
One is written in plain
language, nicely organized,

00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:51.310
and might have some bullet points.

00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:53.380
And you're presented
with that same content,

00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:57.000
and it's a 15-page essay
using really big words.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.420
You’re probably going to
gravitate to the first one

00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:02.270
with the plain language, and the
bullet points, and the headings.

00:12:02.270 --> 00:12:04.790
It's just easier to absorb.

00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:09.250
We're all busy people.

00:12:09.250 --> 00:12:12.880
We all like to get in and get
out, learn things quickly,

00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:14.080
read things quickly.

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:17.890
Our focus is not like it used
to be because of this world

00:12:17.890 --> 00:12:19.560
of technology that we live in.

00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:23.680
So using plain language, it can be
very effective and very helpful.

00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:28.040
There are lots of tools out there
that can help you take your content

00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:30.610
and make it a little
bit easier to read.

00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:35.860
There’s things like the Hemingway
app at Hemingwayapp.com.

00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:46.539
Microsoft Word has built-in
tools that can help you check

00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:50.640
the reading level and the statistics
in your app or your content.

00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:57.660
Artificial intelligence can be a
real help for this kind of thing.

00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:00.950
So something like a ChatGPT.

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:11.200
As long as you are asking the
question in the right way,

00:13:11.930 --> 00:13:15.930
or using the right prompt, like,
Rephrase this original sentence

00:13:15.930 --> 00:13:17.610
using plain language.

00:13:17.610 --> 00:13:22.950
Or maybe you ask ChatGPT to Divide
this paragraph into sentences.

00:13:22.950 --> 00:13:26.070
And it might not be perfect,
but it's going to get you close.

00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:32.940
Paint a picture.

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:37.880
So first of all, don't assume
that everyone can see your screen.

00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:42.840
Again,
it could be somebody who's blind

00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:45.580
and literally cannot see your
screen, or it could be somebody

00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:48.980
who's trying to listen
to your learning content,

00:13:48.980 --> 00:13:50.900
but they don't have the
screen in front of them.

00:13:52.030 --> 00:13:54.590
So describe the
content on the screen.

00:13:54.590 --> 00:14:02.340
Paint the picture with words so
that you can convey the intent

00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:03.810
of the content.

00:14:03.810 --> 00:14:08.390
If you're using images,
use images that support the content,

00:14:08.390 --> 00:14:11.220
not just putting them there
because they're decorative.

00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:15.800
In this particular case,
on this slide, I've chosen a picture

00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:20.010
of someone wearing a
blue button-down shirt.

00:14:20.010 --> 00:14:23.770
They've got a paintbrush in one
hand, a pen in another,

00:14:23.770 --> 00:14:26.060
and they are covered
in all sorts of paint.

00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:31.860
They're obviously very messy artist,
but they are painting a picture

00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:32.980
with these tools.

00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:40.190
The other thing to do, and this
one can be difficult to undo,

00:14:40.190 --> 00:14:46.190
I have it, is using terms like as
you can see or as you can hear.

00:14:46.190 --> 00:14:49.170
Not everybody can see,
and not everybody can hear.

00:14:49.170 --> 00:14:55.480
So try to find ways that talk
about what's on your screen

00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:58.060
without using terms like that.

00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:07.510
Universal Design for Learning.

00:15:09.650 --> 00:15:13.020
As I mentioned at the
beginning, it's a big subject.

00:15:13.020 --> 00:15:14.920
There's a lot to it.

00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:21.450
It's almost like a WCAG in
that it can feel really complex

00:15:21.450 --> 00:15:24.920
and really big and hard to digest.

00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:29.240
But what I want to cover today
is just some few top-level things

00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:30.960
for you to consider.

00:15:34.060 --> 00:15:37.394
And even if you only pick one
thing and try working on that,

00:15:37.395 --> 00:15:38.600
that's great.

00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:40.850
So what is it all about?

00:15:40.850 --> 00:15:43.217
The UDL Guidelines
provide a framework

00:15:43.218 --> 00:15:47.350
to improve and optimize teaching
and learning for all people.

00:15:47.350 --> 00:15:52.890
And you can get all the information
at UDLguidelines.cast.org

00:15:52.890 --> 00:15:55.660
Cast, C-A-S-T.

00:15:56.989 --> 00:15:59.910
And it’s really three
guiding principles.

00:15:59.910 --> 00:16:02.200
You provide a multiple
means of engagement.

00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:04.350
So that supports
the why of learning.

00:16:04.350 --> 00:16:08.650
Why are we doing this? Provide
multiple means of representation.

00:16:08.650 --> 00:16:13.510
So what are we learning?
And provide multiple means of action

00:16:13.510 --> 00:16:14.330
and expression.

00:16:14.330 --> 00:16:18.080
So how are we doing the learning?
And I'm going to cover each one

00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:20.280
of these as we move forward.

00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:25.430
Provide multiple
means of engagement.

00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:27.930
Find different ways for your
learners to get involved.

00:16:27.930 --> 00:16:32.440
So that could be including
a variety of activities,

00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:34.800
like my failed attempt
at a Mentimeter.

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:38.190
In case you were wondering why I
was doing that, that's an example

00:16:38.190 --> 00:16:43.710
of how you include activities
to get people engaged.

00:16:43.710 --> 00:16:48.000
And some people might like a
menti, some people might not.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.350
But it's there for people who
do like that sort of thing.

00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:54.670
So we try to include different
ways for people to engage

00:16:54.670 --> 00:16:59.200
with the content,
including interaction with others.

00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:02.350
So there's been a lot of that
going on today in the chat.

00:17:02.350 --> 00:17:03.460
That's great.

00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:05.750
That's a way of engaging.

00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:09.920
So if you're doing webinars,
encourage that kind of conversation.

00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:13.180
Maybe you have a Slack channel
specific to your learning,

00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:17.550
or you have a blog
post that's ongoing.

00:17:17.550 --> 00:17:20.790
There's different ways to do
it, and it all depends on

00:17:20.790 --> 00:17:23.470
what it is that you are
trying to teach people,

00:17:23.470 --> 00:17:25.850
and what best suits your
particular audience.

00:17:27.390 --> 00:17:31.140
The other thing to do is include the
same content in different formats.

00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:37.400
So when I was showing slides
with text on it, the images

00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:42.960
that I was choosing supported
the text so that somebody

00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:46.080
who's a visual learner could
look at the image and say,

00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:47.940
Oh, yes, I kind of get
what she's talking about.

00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:52.580
Kind of reinforces the content that
I'm trying to share with you today.

00:17:54.660 --> 00:18:01.910
The next slide is going to
be a very short video clip.

00:18:01.910 --> 00:18:04.350
There are captions on it.

00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:07.440
But there's also a
transcript available

00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:19.240
at
A11y.school/WPa11y/inaccessibletext.

00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:22.209
So for those of you who don't
want to watch the video,

00:18:22.210 --> 00:18:26.870
feel free to grab that
transcript and read along.

00:18:26.870 --> 00:18:27.840
OK.

00:18:33.207 --> 00:18:33.597
[automated female voice]

00:18:36.380 --> 00:18:37.990
This clip is inaccessible.

00:18:40.830 --> 00:18:43.820
So now we've got two things
on our screen right now.

00:18:43.820 --> 00:18:48.530
We have the website that
we're working on the left,

00:18:48.530 --> 00:18:52.910
and on the right
is some basic HTML.

00:18:52.910 --> 00:18:58.480
You’ll see I have my code
editor open with a document,

00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:01.890
and there's lots of
HTML in there already.

00:19:01.890 --> 00:19:05.220
But what we want to do is add
a little bit more structure

00:19:05.221 --> 00:19:06.330
to the site.

00:19:06.330 --> 00:19:10.870
So the first thing we want to
do is take a look at this menu

00:19:10.870 --> 00:19:11.870
that we've got here.

00:19:14.370 --> 00:19:18.620
There was a couple of things in
there that I touched on earlier.

00:19:18.620 --> 00:19:22.440
And even Jennison actually
talked about the whole idea

00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:23.210
of left and right.

00:19:23.210 --> 00:19:27.740
If you saw Jennison’s Keynote this
morning, it talked about that.

00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:32.170
Left and right means nothing in the
context of digital accessibility

00:19:32.170 --> 00:19:35.170
for Jennison,
for somebody who is blind.

00:19:35.170 --> 00:19:38.320
So I'm talking about something
being on the left of the screen

00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:39.780
and the right of the screen.

00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:41.640
I talked about as you can see.

00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:44.460
Well, not everybody can
see what's on the screen.

00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:50.470
So that's a snip of a
pretty typical video lesson,

00:19:50.470 --> 00:19:54.120
whether it's something that's being
shared from a high school classroom

00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:56.360
or a webinar that we've recorded.

00:19:56.360 --> 00:20:04.360
We do this all the time, and it's not
necessarily the best way to do it.

00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:18.190
The next part of UDL talks about
multiple means of representation.

00:20:18.190 --> 00:20:22.350
So find different ways for
learners to access your content,

00:20:22.350 --> 00:20:25.680
and I've been doing that by
providing a video transcript

00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:28.020
as well as showing the video.

00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:30.031
So if you want to
read the transcript,

00:20:30.032 --> 00:20:33.170
and that works better for you,
then the content is there.

00:20:33.170 --> 00:20:35.370
[Inaudible 00:20:33]

00:20:36.980 --> 00:20:38.260
the same content.

00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:42.720
If you'd rather watch the video, then
I'm presenting it to you in a video.

00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:46.760
Multiple means of representation is
really about finding different ways

00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:50.620
to give your learners
content, obviously making sure

00:20:50.620 --> 00:20:53.167
that your content is
accessible in whatever way

00:20:53.168 --> 00:20:54.600
that you are providing it.

00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:56.930
But provide it in different ways.

00:20:56.930 --> 00:20:58.210
We all learn differently.

00:20:58.210 --> 00:21:01.900
We all have a preferred
way of doing things.

00:21:03.020 --> 00:21:06.460
So give that opportunity
to your students as well.

00:21:07.690 --> 00:21:11.680
Also look for different ways to
check your learner's understanding.

00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:18.390
It could be a quick conversation
in a classroom setting.

00:21:18.390 --> 00:21:21.890
It could be a quick
chat in a Zoom Webinar.

00:21:21.890 --> 00:21:23.950
Again, it could be a chat
in something like Slack.

00:21:25.070 --> 00:21:30.650
So think about how you can use
different ways to deliver information

00:21:30.650 --> 00:21:32.330
and also to check understanding.

00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:35.250
I'm going to show another clip.

00:21:36.890 --> 00:21:46.423
Again, the transcript is available
at A11y.school/WPa11y/accessibletext.

00:21:50.260 --> 00:21:50.809
[Automated female voice]

00:21:50.810 --> 00:21:52.580
This clip is accessible.

00:21:55.460 --> 00:21:55.780
Great.

00:21:55.780 --> 00:22:00.220
So now that we've switched
screens, we have our website

00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:02.990
on the left side of the screen.

00:22:02.990 --> 00:22:05.090
And this website,
it's pretty basic.

00:22:05.090 --> 00:22:09.990
We have some menu with home,
about, history, contact.

00:22:09.990 --> 00:22:12.740
A heading that says
Welcome to our website.

00:22:12.740 --> 00:22:18.090
Some text with a
link out to WCAG 2.1.

00:22:18.090 --> 00:22:21.480
And a cat that's taken
an accidental selfie.

00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:27.960
This little white cat is staring up
at the phone with great, big eyes.

00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:31.980
Clearly, it found the selfie button
and seems to be pretty confused

00:22:31.980 --> 00:22:33.590
by what he's done.

00:22:33.590 --> 00:22:35.390
Cute all in all.

00:22:35.390 --> 00:22:40.760
On the right side of the screen,
we have the HTML that is used

00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:43.080
to create the website.

00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:49.260
So at the top of the screen,
the HTML is pretty standard.

00:22:49.260 --> 00:22:54.700
We have the doctype that says,
angle bracket, exclamation,

00:22:54.700 --> 00:22:58.020
doctype HTML, close angle bracket.

00:22:58.020 --> 00:23:01.730
And that tells the browser
that this is an HTML document,

00:23:01.730 --> 00:23:08.260
and it needs to think
about it that way.

00:23:08.260 --> 00:23:11.100
So it's better than the first one.

00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:14.960
I've been much more
descriptive in this video.

00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:18.610
I described the cat with
the accidental selfie.

00:23:18.610 --> 00:23:20.670
I didn't even touch on
that in the first video.

00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:29.940
I started talking about all the HTML
code that's in the HTML document.

00:23:31.810 --> 00:23:35.330
And really, when you're doing
something, especially something

00:23:35.330 --> 00:23:38.250
that's technically related, you’re
going to have to find a balance

00:23:38.250 --> 00:23:42.930
between saying every single
character that's on the screen

00:23:42.930 --> 00:23:46.720
and maybe finding shortcuts,
like saying that Remember to open

00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:50.710
and close your tags, rather
than saying Open angle bracket,

00:23:50.710 --> 00:23:54.400
close angle bracket
for every line of HTML.

00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:59.450
So that's something that you will
need to kind of adapt to your kind

00:23:59.450 --> 00:24:00.450
of content.

00:24:01.260 --> 00:24:06.010
Although, keep in mind
that not everybody's going

00:24:06.010 --> 00:24:08.950
to be watching you
type on the screen.

00:24:08.950 --> 00:24:12.270
So if you're typing
something, say it out loud.

00:24:12.270 --> 00:24:15.030
So that's what integrated
described video is all about.

00:24:15.030 --> 00:24:18.730
It's describing what's
happening on the screen.

00:24:18.730 --> 00:24:22.270
It's almost like listening
to a baseball game.

00:24:22.270 --> 00:24:25.740
My husband and I are big
Toronto Blue Jays fans.

00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:28.890
We listen quite often on the
radio, and radio announcers

00:24:28.890 --> 00:24:32.380
for baseball are really good at
describing not just what's happening

00:24:32.380 --> 00:24:36.100
on the playing field, but what's
happening around the players

00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:37.310
and in the stadium itself.

00:24:37.310 --> 00:24:40.480
So think of yourself as a
baseball announcer on the radio,

00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:43.570
and that can give you some
clues or hints as to how to kind

00:24:43.570 --> 00:24:47.520
of move forward with things.

00:24:49.310 --> 00:24:57.260
The last principle
of Universal Design

00:24:57.260 --> 00:25:00.310
for Learning is providing multiple
means of action and expression.

00:25:01.730 --> 00:25:05.040
So give learners options for
demonstrating their understanding

00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:06.850
of the content.

00:25:06.850 --> 00:25:11.690
That could be giving them a
choice of assignment options.

00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:15.670
Maybe you've always asked for
people to submit an essay.

00:25:15.670 --> 00:25:18.680
Well, maybe open it up to them.

00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:21.040
Maybe let them choose
how they want to deliver.

00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:24.053
It could be a
PowerPoint presentation,

00:25:24.054 --> 00:25:26.370
or it could be a short video.

00:25:26.370 --> 00:25:29.760
Let them choose how they want
to explain things to you.

00:25:31.300 --> 00:25:37.640
If you're using Quizizz,
which is quite common,

00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:44.810
especially in online learning,
use different types of questions.

00:25:44.810 --> 00:25:48.060
So true or false, multiple
choice, fill in the blank.

00:25:48.060 --> 00:25:53.040
Don't just make it a whole 25-set
question of true and false.

00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:54.620
That's not helpful for people.

00:25:54.620 --> 00:25:57.980
Give them different types
of questions to answer.

00:26:01.970 --> 00:26:04.300
We’re going to put
this to the test.

00:26:04.300 --> 00:26:06.890
What's your favorite
kind of quiz question?

00:26:06.890 --> 00:26:11.440
I want you to use the Zoom reactions
to tell me what you actually like.

00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:16.660
If you prefer true or false,
use the clapping-hands reaction.

00:26:16.660 --> 00:26:19.850
If you like multiple
choice, use the thumbs up.

00:26:20.950 --> 00:26:24.120
And if you like fill in the
blank, use a heart.

00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:31.170
I'm starting to see
reactions floating up.

00:26:32.790 --> 00:26:38.420
And multiple choice seems to
be the winner, by a long shot.

00:26:38.420 --> 00:26:40.670
That’s really interesting.

00:26:40.670 --> 00:26:42.650
And I’m curious,
I wonder why that is.

00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:45.080
Thank you for that.

00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:51.740
Fill in the blank is not
very popular, I don't think.

00:26:51.740 --> 00:26:57.920
OK, so we're getting near the end.

00:26:57.920 --> 00:26:59.410
So how did I use this?

00:26:59.410 --> 00:27:03.040
I talked about UDL, but how
did I actually use it myself?

00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:05.060
So providing multiple
means of engagement.

00:27:05.060 --> 00:27:08.140
We had the opening poll with
Mentimeter, which failed,

00:27:08.140 --> 00:27:09.670
but it was an attempt.

00:27:11.230 --> 00:27:15.190
We used reactions just
now to get you engaged.

00:27:15.190 --> 00:27:17.770
How did I use multiple
means of representation?

00:27:19.060 --> 00:27:23.750
I had images that match the content,
and I provided video transcripts

00:27:23.750 --> 00:27:25.110
for the videos that I showed.

00:27:27.210 --> 00:27:32.100
How did I provide multiple
means of action and expression?

00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:33.430
I use different types of media.

00:27:33.430 --> 00:27:36.570
Some of them were images,
some of them were video.

00:27:37.770 --> 00:27:40.360
Use this concept of scaffolding.

00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:44.600
Scaffolding is like building
one lesson on top of another.

00:27:45.660 --> 00:27:49.820
So I told you what we're going to
talk about; we talked about it.

00:27:49.820 --> 00:27:55.670
And I provided you with different
ways of seeing what that looked like

00:27:55.670 --> 00:27:57.520
or what that was like in practice.

00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:06.260
This has been mentioned before:
progress over perfection.

00:28:07.630 --> 00:28:08.720
I'm not perfect.

00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:10.750
I don't get everything right.

00:28:10.750 --> 00:28:14.710
I’ve heard myself giving this
presentation and using words

00:28:14.710 --> 00:28:18.640
that I probably wished I hadn't
used, or describe things in ways

00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:21.710
that I hadn’t,
but I made an effort.

00:28:21.710 --> 00:28:24.310
I tried to do as best I could.

00:28:24.310 --> 00:28:27.960
I tried to incorporate as many
things as I possibly could

00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:30.859
to make this a more engaging and,

00:28:30.860 --> 00:28:34.460
hopefully,
educational session for you.

00:28:34.460 --> 00:28:37.750
So my question back to you
is, what can you do

00:28:37.750 --> 00:28:39.590
to make your lessons
more accessible?

00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:47.990
With that, we’ll move to questions.

00:28:47.990 --> 00:28:51.510
Happy to take questions
from anyone in the room.

00:28:52.180 --> 00:28:54.190
>> BEN: Hey, Sandi,
thank you so much.

00:28:55.420 --> 00:28:56.240
Awesome content.

00:28:56.240 --> 00:29:01.100
I am wishing that the educators
that I'd had when I was

00:29:01.100 --> 00:29:03.080
in school had followed
approaches like this.

00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:05.470
I think both I and a lot of
my classmates would have been

00:29:05.470 --> 00:29:09.720
a lot more successful in actually
absorbing real information.

00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:10.780
But thank you; that was great.

00:29:12.060 --> 00:29:16.960
We've got lots of good questions
in the Q&A, so we'll tackle them

00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:18.530
as we can.

00:29:18.530 --> 00:29:20.900
A question from Faye [phonetic]:

00:29:20.900 --> 00:29:27.550
Are automated captions better
than auto-generated captions?

00:29:27.550 --> 00:29:31.510
I know custom captions are the best,
but a lot of clients aren't going

00:29:31.510 --> 00:29:31.950
to do it.

00:29:31.950 --> 00:29:35.670
So it's either
auto-generated or nothing.

00:29:35.670 --> 00:29:36.778
Thoughts.

00:29:36.779 --> 00:29:40.100
>> SANDI: Well,
I'd say auto is better than nothing.

00:29:40.100 --> 00:29:45.400
At least it gives people who
need them some sort of context.

00:29:47.570 --> 00:29:49.110
No captions leaves
them with nothing.

00:29:49.110 --> 00:29:49.770
What do they do?

00:29:49.770 --> 00:29:54.130
I don't think artificial
intelligence can help them yet

00:29:54.130 --> 00:29:56.050
in auto-generating captions.

00:29:57.060 --> 00:30:00.670
You're not going to get them
to upload a video to YouTube

00:30:00.670 --> 00:30:03.770
to get it generated or get
them to sign up for service.

00:30:03.770 --> 00:30:09.540
So I'm not sure that
nothing is the answer.

00:30:09.540 --> 00:30:11.180
It's like the progress
over perfection.

00:30:11.180 --> 00:30:12.160
It's progress.

00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:13.330
It's better than nothing.

00:30:13.330 --> 00:30:17.070
It shows that at least you
put some effort into it.

00:30:17.070 --> 00:30:22.770
And maybe you can slowly convince
people to take the time to do it.

00:30:22.770 --> 00:30:23.680
Yes, it's work.

00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:24.920
Everything is work.

00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:27.630
You just make time for
it in your scheduling.

00:30:27.630 --> 00:30:30.880
If you're putting content together
and you know there's going

00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:34.000
to be video and you know it's
going to need to be captioned,

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:35.120
put that in your schedule.

00:30:35.121 --> 00:30:38.861
Make the time for it, and then
it just becomes second nature.

00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:41.650
>> BEN: Yes.

00:30:41.650 --> 00:30:43.690
Question from Sambor [phonetic]:

00:30:43.690 --> 00:30:46.550
Do you have any examples
of tools like Hemingway app

00:30:46.550 --> 00:30:48.490
for languages other than English?

00:30:49.700 --> 00:30:51.250
>> SANDI: Ooh.

00:30:51.250 --> 00:30:52.140
No.

00:30:52.140 --> 00:30:54.040
And that's a very good question.

00:30:54.040 --> 00:30:55.130
[laughs]

00:30:55.130 --> 00:30:57.140
Not that I know of off
the top of my head.

00:30:57.140 --> 00:31:01.700
I would think, though,
that Word, because it's got

00:31:01.700 --> 00:31:04.750
the accessibility checker in it, as
well as the reading-level checker in.

00:31:04.750 --> 00:31:07.740
If you're using it in
your native language,

00:31:07.740 --> 00:31:09.410
that might be an
alternative for you.

00:31:10.700 --> 00:31:15.970
Certainly, ChatGPT or any of those
AI tools can be a good source.

00:31:15.970 --> 00:31:21.220
As long as you're asking the right
prompt, they’ll help you get closer.

00:31:21.220 --> 00:31:24.230
They're not going to get you
perfect, but they'll get you closer.

00:31:24.230 --> 00:31:29.610
The other thing on just that
whole idea of another language is

00:31:29.610 --> 00:31:32.970
that we forget that not
everybody that's listening to us

00:31:32.970 --> 00:31:36.590
or reading our content speaks
the same language as us,

00:31:36.590 --> 00:31:38.470
or that's it’s their
native language.

00:31:38.470 --> 00:31:41.390
This is particularly important
in a learning institution

00:31:41.390 --> 00:31:44.690
where you've got students
from all over the world.

00:31:45.890 --> 00:31:48.620
You can't assume that they're
going to understand everything

00:31:48.620 --> 00:31:50.160
that you deliver in
your native language.

00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:52.830
So plain language helps.

00:31:52.830 --> 00:31:55.920
Translation tools can do a
better job of translating it

00:31:55.920 --> 00:31:59.260
to somebody's preferred
language if the language

00:31:59.260 --> 00:32:01.310
that you're using is plain.

00:32:01.310 --> 00:32:04.020
So there's that added
benefit as well.

00:32:05.340 --> 00:32:06.640
>> BEN: That's a great call out.

00:32:12.330 --> 00:32:16.330
Question from Ron: How accessible
are platforms like LearnDash

00:32:16.330 --> 00:32:17.430
and TalentLMS?

00:32:17.430 --> 00:32:20.586
Or is it just dependent
on the content?

00:32:21.372 --> 00:32:21.957
>> SANDI: Ooh.

00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:25.850
OK, I don't want [chuckles]

00:32:25.850 --> 00:32:27.970
into trouble or get
anybody else in trouble.

00:32:29.140 --> 00:32:32.590
The only way you're going
to know that those platforms

00:32:32.590 --> 00:32:34.890
are accessible is to do
all the things that a lot

00:32:34.890 --> 00:32:37.130
of the other presenters have
been talking about today:

00:32:37.130 --> 00:32:40.450
get real users testing them.

00:32:40.450 --> 00:32:45.400
Yes, to a certain extent, if
something like a LearnDash is dropped

00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:47.920
into an accessible theme,
you're getting closer.

00:32:48.980 --> 00:32:52.050
But having developed a
couple of learning programs

00:32:52.050 --> 00:32:56.310
using something like a
WordPress plugin, an LMS plugin,

00:32:57.570 --> 00:32:59.860
they’re not great out of the box.

00:32:59.860 --> 00:33:02.180
They're not great in the
back-end for anybody who's got

00:33:02.180 --> 00:33:05.510
to manage the content
and get it in there.

00:33:05.510 --> 00:33:11.180
They're also not great for somebody
who's using assistive technology

00:33:11.180 --> 00:33:12.930
and going through the process.

00:33:14.450 --> 00:33:18.290
We had many users testing,
and we had to, at the end

00:33:18.290 --> 00:33:23.470
of the day,
really simplify what was out there

00:33:23.470 --> 00:33:25.050
in order to make
it work for people.

00:33:25.050 --> 00:33:29.720
So out of the box,
probably not going to be accessible.

00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:31.290
You're probably still going
to need to do some work,

00:33:31.290 --> 00:33:33.490
and you're certainly going to
need to get end users involved

00:33:33.490 --> 00:33:35.050
to see what works and
what doesn't work.

00:33:37.170 --> 00:33:37.610
>> BEN: Yes.

00:33:37.610 --> 00:33:41.490
And I know that VPATs
are a useful tool,

00:33:41.490 --> 00:33:45.880
or Accessibility Conformance Reports
are a useful tool in that search,

00:33:45.880 --> 00:33:47.145
but you always have to
[Inaudible 00:33:47].

00:33:48.540 --> 00:33:50.240
>> SANDI: Test, test, test.

00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:51.260
[chuckles]

00:33:52.820 --> 00:33:56.640
>> BEN: Someone anonymous asked:
Do you have any recommendations

00:33:56.640 --> 00:33:59.850
or resources on how to
effectively describe images?

00:34:00.780 --> 00:34:01.900
>> SANDI: Resources.

00:34:01.900 --> 00:34:07.920
I think that's more of a skill
that you have to develop.

00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:14.070
So it's something that I think is
a bit of an art form personally.

00:34:23.460 --> 00:34:26.660
Somebody once described
it to me as this:

00:34:27.940 --> 00:34:30.900
Try to describe it like you were
describing an image over the phone

00:34:30.900 --> 00:34:32.350
to your friend.

00:34:32.350 --> 00:34:35.760
So if you can describe it
in a couple of sentences,

00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:37.580
then you're probably good.

00:34:37.580 --> 00:34:43.420
I'm not familiar with specific
resources that talk about

00:34:43.420 --> 00:34:47.270
how to write accessible
text or alternative text,

00:34:49.450 --> 00:34:52.090
but I do know that keeping it
simple, keeping it short,

00:34:52.090 --> 00:34:55.370
keeping it descriptive is
really what you're going for,

00:34:55.370 --> 00:34:56.540
as well as the purpose of it.

00:34:56.540 --> 00:35:00.080
If you're trying to describe an
image that's just kind of fluff,

00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:03.120
it's there to fill
in a space on a page,

00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:04.500
then maybe you don't even
need the image at all.

00:35:05.570 --> 00:35:06.800
Same thing with PowerPoints.

00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:08.910
Do you really need an
image on every slide?

00:35:08.910 --> 00:35:12.570
If that slide doesn't need an image,
don't stick something in there

00:35:12.570 --> 00:35:15.990
just for the sake of
sticking something in there.

00:35:15.990 --> 00:35:17.440
It needs to add value.

00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:21.930
Sometimes I think even
that curation of content

00:35:21.930 --> 00:35:23.880
can make a big
difference down the road.

00:35:25.086 --> 00:35:26.146
>> BEN: Yes.

00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:32.870
Somebody said in a talk earlier:
Describe it like you're describing it

00:35:32.870 --> 00:35:34.910
to your grandmother over the phone.

00:35:34.910 --> 00:35:37.800
That kind of infused the care
and attention to the outcome,

00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:40.110
like empathy and
care for the outcome,

00:35:40.110 --> 00:35:41.590
which I really like
thinking about it that way.

00:35:42.260 --> 00:35:42.950
>> SANDI: Yes, that’s good.

00:35:42.950 --> 00:35:43.250
Yes.

00:35:43.250 --> 00:35:47.800
>> BEN: I'll also quickly plug a
talk that's coming up later today

00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:52.470
by Caroline Desrosiers: Alt
Text in the Age of Automation:

00:35:52.470 --> 00:35:53.689
How's it Actually Going?

00:35:53.690 --> 00:35:56.230
I think folks will get
some interesting insights

00:35:56.230 --> 00:35:59.240
on describing alt text and
tools that do that well

00:35:59.240 --> 00:36:00.840
or not from there.

00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:05.990
Question from Jennifer:
Hello from Koolway Sports.

00:36:05.990 --> 00:36:09.620
Should every social-media post have
a description in English and French?

00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:13.820
>> SANDI: Oh, she's a fellow
Canadian, I'm guessing.

00:36:13.820 --> 00:36:17.730
I'm going to say that's going
to depend on your audience.

00:36:17.730 --> 00:36:22.510
If you are speaking to
a bilingual audience,

00:36:22.510 --> 00:36:26.330
or you're a national organization
and you're speaking to people

00:36:26.330 --> 00:36:30.030
on social media in both
English and French, then yes,

00:36:30.030 --> 00:36:32.500
I think you need to have
it in both languages.

00:36:32.500 --> 00:36:36.630
If your audience is predominantly
English or predominantly French,

00:36:38.620 --> 00:36:41.980
then you're probably fine to
just write your alternative text

00:36:41.980 --> 00:36:46.030
or your descriptions in the
language that your audience uses.

00:36:46.030 --> 00:36:50.990
We come from in a marketing
background, our company.

00:36:50.990 --> 00:36:52.160
It's knowing your audience.

00:36:52.160 --> 00:36:53.240
Who are you talking to?

00:36:53.240 --> 00:36:56.200
If you don't know who your audience
is, it becomes very difficult

00:36:56.200 --> 00:36:58.490
to give them the
content that they need.

00:36:58.490 --> 00:37:01.580
If you know your audience is
English and French-speaking,

00:37:01.580 --> 00:37:02.950
then give them both.

00:37:05.180 --> 00:37:05.770
>> BEN: Great.

00:37:05.770 --> 00:37:06.770
Thanks.

00:37:08.270 --> 00:37:14.650
Question from Karine [phonetic]:

00:37:16.660 --> 00:37:19.400
What about saying above or below?

00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:21.660
That’s probably wrong too.

00:37:21.660 --> 00:37:22.480
>> SANDI: Oh.

00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:24.930
Yes, it's not ideal.

00:37:24.930 --> 00:37:32.860
When trying to describe
things on a screen, you need

00:37:32.860 --> 00:37:38.180
to provide context for people
who can't see the screen, right?

00:37:38.180 --> 00:37:40.050
Left and right, top and bottom.

00:37:41.220 --> 00:37:45.020
Top and bottom is probably better
because content is read top

00:37:45.020 --> 00:37:46.020
to bottom.

00:37:46.830 --> 00:37:47.850
It's very linear.

00:37:47.850 --> 00:37:50.380
So if you think about
your content being linear,

00:37:51.730 --> 00:37:54.300
I don't think you're
getting into trouble.

00:37:54.300 --> 00:37:57.550
I think where people get into trouble
when they say things like left

00:37:57.550 --> 00:38:00.790
and right or top and bottom
is that they don't provide

00:38:00.790 --> 00:38:03.640
any additional context around it.

00:38:03.640 --> 00:38:07.620
So you could say, On one side
of my screen, I have the picture

00:38:07.620 --> 00:38:10.420
of the cat taking a selfie,
and on the other side

00:38:10.420 --> 00:38:15.950
of the screen, I have my
text editor showing the code.

00:38:15.950 --> 00:38:18.700
It doesn't matter really if
it's on the left or the right

00:38:18.700 --> 00:38:20.920
in the grand scheme of things.

00:38:20.920 --> 00:38:24.500
So it could be just as
simple as doing that.

00:38:24.500 --> 00:38:27.690
It could be, you know, instead
of saying, the top or the bottom

00:38:27.690 --> 00:38:31.260
of the screen, you could say,
At the beginning of my code,

00:38:31.260 --> 00:38:35.190
there's this, and you know,
20 lines later, there's this.

00:38:36.500 --> 00:38:41.080
So it's subtle, and it's not
something you have to do overnight.

00:38:41.080 --> 00:38:44.790
It's just like trying to listen
to yourself when talking.

00:38:44.790 --> 00:38:46.688
And when you start
listening to yourself

00:38:46.689 --> 00:38:48.170
and hearing what you're saying,

00:38:48.170 --> 00:38:50.210
you catch yourself
more often [chuckles]

00:38:50.210 --> 00:38:52.740
than you realize and
go, Ah, it wasn't great.

00:38:52.740 --> 00:38:54.180
I need to redo that next time. Yes.

00:38:54.180 --> 00:38:54.660
>> BEN: Yes.

00:38:55.460 --> 00:38:57.800
>> SANDI: As long as you're
aware and paying attention.

00:38:59.360 --> 00:39:02.040
That's always step number one.

00:39:03.084 --> 00:39:03.652
>> BEN: Yes.

00:39:04.780 --> 00:39:10.540
Question from Sam: When building
a course with an LMS in WordPress,

00:39:10.540 --> 00:39:15.930
should I stay away from using an
accordion to hide or show lessons

00:39:15.930 --> 00:39:16.950
and transcripts?

00:39:19.020 --> 00:39:22.020
>> SANDI: If the accordion is
built in an accessible fashion,

00:39:22.020 --> 00:39:25.480
I don't think there's any
issue with using an accordion.

00:39:25.480 --> 00:39:29.520
You get into trouble when
you're using plugins and widgets

00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:33.360
and blocks that had been built for
WordPress, but haven't been built

00:39:33.360 --> 00:39:35.410
with accessibility in mind.

00:39:35.410 --> 00:39:37.170
That's where you get into trouble.

00:39:37.170 --> 00:39:40.380
I would say that if you are
going to use an accordion,

00:39:40.380 --> 00:39:47.340
make sure that the question
or the topic or whatever it is

00:39:49.210 --> 00:39:56.440
that's visible when it's not
exposed, make sure it's clear.

00:39:56.440 --> 00:39:58.380
An FAQ is an easy
way to describe it.

00:39:58.380 --> 00:40:02.910
So if you have an FAQ page,
make sure the questions are

00:40:02.910 --> 00:40:05.550
what are visible before the
box [Inaudible 00:40:05].

00:40:05.550 --> 00:40:06.680
Make sure those are clear.

00:40:08.450 --> 00:40:12.380
If you can make them so that
they are headings, that's great.

00:40:12.380 --> 00:40:14.258
If you make the FAQ
questions headings,

00:40:14.259 --> 00:40:15.620
then it's great for somebody

00:40:15.620 --> 00:40:18.890
who might use a screen reader to
just navigate through the list

00:40:18.890 --> 00:40:19.750
of headings.

00:40:19.750 --> 00:40:22.460
So there's nothing wrong with
them if they're done properly.

00:40:23.533 --> 00:40:24.041
>> BEN: Great.

00:40:27.310 --> 00:40:30.740
Question from Joshua:
I've seen some websites

00:40:30.740 --> 00:40:33.390
where they include
‘accessibility options,’

00:40:34.990 --> 00:40:37.740
where users can choose the
look and feel of the web pages

00:40:37.740 --> 00:40:39.710
on the site to better
suit their needs.

00:40:39.710 --> 00:40:42.100
Is that better, do you think,
than trying to make your website

00:40:42.100 --> 00:40:46.440
as inclusive as possible, where you
can’t cover all disabilities at once?

00:40:46.440 --> 00:40:48.070
>> SANDI: Yes.

00:40:48.070 --> 00:40:51.850
I think that's a personal
preference, I would say.

00:40:53.130 --> 00:40:57.060
I'm all for doing it
right from the get go.

00:40:57.060 --> 00:41:00.600
And it marries in nicely with the
whole idea of Universal Design

00:41:00.600 --> 00:41:01.500
for Learning.

00:41:01.500 --> 00:41:04.410
Universal design for Learning is
intended to make learning good

00:41:04.410 --> 00:41:05.940
for everybody.

00:41:05.940 --> 00:41:10.310
Like I said in the presentation,
we all learn differently.

00:41:10.310 --> 00:41:12.710
We all need different
ways to learn.

00:41:12.710 --> 00:41:16.940
So if you're building an
accessible WordPress theme

00:41:16.940 --> 00:41:21.200
with accessible content that's
well structured, well organized,

00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:25.530
your theme colors are
appropriate, you don't have bells

00:41:25.530 --> 00:41:27.890
and whistles happening
all over the place.

00:41:27.890 --> 00:41:32.250
I'm not so sure that those
accessibility options are going

00:41:32.250 --> 00:41:36.430
to make that much more of a
difference for the end users.

00:41:36.430 --> 00:41:39.810
And some people could argue that
having all those extra options

00:41:39.810 --> 00:41:44.390
can become clutter,
and can be too much information

00:41:44.390 --> 00:41:46.830
for some people,
and can become a distraction.

00:41:46.830 --> 00:41:49.710
So it's a balance, right?

00:41:51.500 --> 00:41:56.510
I think if you can build
out a site with content,

00:41:56.510 --> 00:42:00.450
whether it's learning content
or a regular website that works

00:42:00.450 --> 00:42:04.440
without making those accessibility
options available, that's great.

00:42:04.440 --> 00:42:08.140
Also use your accessibility
statement to talk about things

00:42:08.140 --> 00:42:12.270
that maybe are not perfect or
that you're still working on.

00:42:12.270 --> 00:42:15.640
And always be available to provide
additional support to a user

00:42:15.640 --> 00:42:16.910
that needs it.

00:42:16.910 --> 00:42:20.960
Maybe you've done everything
you could possibly think of

00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:26.240
to deliver an accessible learning
program, you’ve used all the concepts

00:42:26.240 --> 00:42:29.250
of UDL, and still it
doesn't work for somebody.

00:42:29.250 --> 00:42:30.880
You're going to be
dealing with that.

00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:33.640
It's almost impossible
to avoid that.

00:42:33.640 --> 00:42:37.560
So I think it comes down
to personal preference

00:42:37.560 --> 00:42:38.840
and what your audience needs.

00:42:38.840 --> 00:42:43.540
If you've got people coming to you
time after time after time saying,

00:42:43.540 --> 00:42:46.200
I want those accessibility
options, then put them on.

00:42:46.200 --> 00:42:47.050
[chuckles]

00:42:47.050 --> 00:42:51.460
But if they're not being used,
then maybe you can get rid of them.

00:42:53.020 --> 00:42:55.600
>> BEN: And I think it also
depends on how those options are

00:42:55.600 --> 00:42:58.820
being injected, like,
if they're being, like, JavaScript,

00:42:58.820 --> 00:43:01.060
or if they're actually built
into the semantics of the site.

00:43:02.530 --> 00:43:03.670
Again, progress over perfection.

00:43:03.670 --> 00:43:06.030
But some solutions that
do that sort of thing

00:43:06.030 --> 00:43:08.000
are actually a step
backwards, and make it worse.

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:12.460
So I would say always make sure
you're testing with real users

00:43:12.460 --> 00:43:15.130
to see if those options are making
it better for them or worse.

00:43:15.130 --> 00:43:16.170
>> SANDI: Exactly.

00:43:16.583 --> 00:43:16.863
Yes.

00:43:19.020 --> 00:43:22.540
>> BEN: Anonymous question: Do
you ever post a presentation

00:43:22.540 --> 00:43:26.070
after the lesson to a website?

00:43:26.070 --> 00:43:29.120
And then how do you make it
accessible? I'm not sure...

00:43:29.120 --> 00:43:33.590
Do you ever post a presentation
after the lesson to a website?

00:43:33.590 --> 00:43:35.550
And then how do you
make it accessible?

00:43:36.300 --> 00:43:37.260
>> SANDI: Ah, OK.

00:43:37.260 --> 00:43:40.290
So I think this is the question.

00:43:40.290 --> 00:43:44.690
When I first started to teach
at Mohawk, it was pre-pandemic

00:43:44.690 --> 00:43:46.320
so we were in class.

00:43:46.320 --> 00:43:48.680
And, of course,
we moved to online learning.

00:43:48.680 --> 00:43:51.500
The lectures were being
recorded via Zoom.

00:43:51.500 --> 00:43:53.640
We would have Zoom classes.

00:43:53.640 --> 00:43:56.410
And then after the fact,
they would be captioned.

00:43:56.410 --> 00:43:59.990
And when they were captioned,
they would go up on the platform,

00:43:59.990 --> 00:44:02.220
which I can't remember
what it was at the time.

00:44:02.220 --> 00:44:04.300
So yes, they were made available.

00:44:04.300 --> 00:44:07.810
Also, there were students who would
ask, Is it up yet? Is it up yet?

00:44:07.810 --> 00:44:10.700
Because they want to go back
and they want to review it.

00:44:10.700 --> 00:44:12.530
They may be taking notes.

00:44:12.530 --> 00:44:13.620
They may have missed the class.

00:44:13.620 --> 00:44:15.940
They may have to go let
the dog out in the middle

00:44:15.940 --> 00:44:18.610
of the important
part of the lecture.

00:44:18.610 --> 00:44:23.960
So yes, that was very much a
habit of what we did, for sure.

00:44:23.960 --> 00:44:25.430
I think even for
something like this too.

00:44:25.430 --> 00:44:29.690
I know you guys are recording;
you're going to have it captioned,

00:44:29.690 --> 00:44:31.760
and then have it available
for the attendees.

00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:35.590
And that's great, because it's
hard to focus for 24 hours,

00:44:35.590 --> 00:44:38.300
first of all,
and retain all that information.

00:44:38.300 --> 00:44:43.870
Plus, there's some presentations
that would be great to watch again.

00:44:43.870 --> 00:44:44.700
So why not?

00:44:44.700 --> 00:44:45.700
Why wouldn't you?

00:44:46.920 --> 00:44:47.800
Hi, Christina.

00:44:47.800 --> 00:44:48.750
[laughs]

00:44:48.750 --> 00:44:49.280
Sorry.

00:44:49.280 --> 00:44:50.680
Attendee.

00:44:50.680 --> 00:44:51.870
[laughs]

00:44:51.870 --> 00:44:54.890
>> BEN: All good.

00:44:54.890 --> 00:44:57.060
I think we've got time
for one or two more.

00:44:58.620 --> 00:45:00.000
Thanks for all the great
questions, everybody.

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:03.300
Anonymous question: Is it best to
use captions for describing images

00:45:03.300 --> 00:45:06.350
on social media over alt text
on Instagram, for example?

00:45:07.810 --> 00:45:09.670
So captions versus alt text.

00:45:10.540 --> 00:45:12.570
>> SANDI: Captions versus alt text.

00:45:12.570 --> 00:45:15.240
>> BEN: I think maybe
inline image descriptions

00:45:15.240 --> 00:45:17.820
in the body versus using
the alt text feature.

00:45:17.820 --> 00:45:18.900
>> SANDI: OK.

00:45:18.900 --> 00:45:23.340
so I am not a social-media expert,
guru, or user for that matter.

00:45:23.340 --> 00:45:23.770
[chuckles]

00:45:23.770 --> 00:45:25.590
So not my area of expertise.

00:45:26.780 --> 00:45:31.500
I think that I would use
both, to be honest.

00:45:31.500 --> 00:45:37.030
If the social-media platform
provides the opportunity

00:45:37.030 --> 00:45:39.540
to add alternative text, add it in.

00:45:39.540 --> 00:45:41.400
Maybe you don't make
it as descriptive,

00:45:41.400 --> 00:45:46.550
and then you put the fuller
description in the body of the post.

00:45:47.790 --> 00:45:49.860
So that's what I would do.

00:45:49.860 --> 00:45:52.040
There is an excellent
resource out there.

00:45:52.040 --> 00:46:00.040
I think it's Accessible-social.com.
And she's absolutely amazing.

00:46:00.420 --> 00:46:03.110
She is the guru of
accessible social media.

00:46:03.110 --> 00:46:06.500
And if you live in the world
of social media and you want

00:46:06.500 --> 00:46:11.340
to make your social-media posts more
accessible, that is the place to go.

00:46:11.340 --> 00:46:15.320
I'll see if I can find
that after the conversation

00:46:15.320 --> 00:46:17.190
and drop it in the chat for people.

00:46:17.190 --> 00:46:18.590
But that's where I'd go to.

00:46:18.590 --> 00:46:21.130
She's [Inaudible 00:46:19].

00:46:21.130 --> 00:46:21.300
[laughs]

00:46:21.300 --> 00:46:22.550
[crosstalk 00:46:21]

00:46:22.550 --> 00:46:24.171
>> BEN: So I think
that recommendation,

00:46:24.172 --> 00:46:25.590
it has a great pocketbook as well.

00:46:25.590 --> 00:46:27.440
A little pocket-sized
pamphlet that's awesome.

00:46:28.220 --> 00:46:28.670
>> SANDI: Yes.

00:46:28.670 --> 00:46:32.030
>> BEN: OK,
I think that gets us to our time.

00:46:32.030 --> 00:46:33.080
Thank you, Sandi.

00:46:33.080 --> 00:46:37.340
Thank you, everybody, for attending
this great session with Sandi Gauder.

00:46:37.340 --> 00:46:39.710

conversation in chat

00:46:39.710 --> 00:46:47.710
