<v Amber Hinds> WordPress
Accessibility Day 2023.

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:08.510
Opening remarks with Amber Hinds,
WordPress Accessibility Day

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:11.990
Lead Organizer,
and CEO of Equalize Digital.

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:15.290
This was recorded on September
27th, 2023.

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:24.970
We are at 9:46, so I'm going
to go ahead and kick us off

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:29.170
for WordPress
Accessibility Day 2023.

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:32.200
I am incredibly excited
to welcome everyone

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.310
to WordPress Accessibility Day.

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:36.630
This is the second
WordPress Accessibility Day

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.910
that I have had the
honor of organizing.

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:44.960
My name is Amber Hinds,
if you haven't met me, and I am one

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.980
of the Lead Organizers.

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.560
I'm very proud of what we've
accomplished this year.

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:54.340
And so I just wanted to start off
by sharing some of the background

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:58.710
about the event, and some of the
things that you can look forward to,

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.620
and, of course,
give some thank yous.

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.630
So if you aren’t familiar,
Joe Dolson and several people

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:06.200
on the WordPress Core
Accessibility Team founded

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.870
the first WordPress Accessibility
Day in 2020, and I was a volunteer

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:11.740
for that year's event.

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.420
And as a volunteer,
I loved the concept of 24 hours

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.970
of free accessibility education
that could be watched by people

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:20.630
from all around the world.

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:25.220
Many wonderful web accessibility
events happen in the United States,

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.910
but not as many take place during
business hours in other parts

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:30.040
of the world.

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.590
And our hope is that WordPress
Accessibility Day can help

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:35.520
to fill that gap.

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.860
Although it felt a bit
like an experiment,

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.810
reviving WordPress Accessibility
Day as an event independent

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.106
from the WordPress
Community Foundation,

00:01:44.107 --> 00:01:46.010
which is how we did it last year.

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:49.910
Last year's WordPress Accessibility
Day was a great success.

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:53.660
We had a phenomenal organizing
team, great speakers, sponsors,

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:54.470
and volunteers.

00:01:54.470 --> 00:02:00.950
And by the end of the event,
1,604 people had registered.

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.760
This year, Joe, Bet Hannon,
and I took the event further

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.210
and we registered WordPress
Accessibility Day,

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:13.830
which is actually WP Accessibility
Day, as an independent organization.

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.180
And then through a
partnership with Knowbility,

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.380
we gained 501(C)(3)
nonprofit status.

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:25.100
The reception this year has been
more than we could have imagined.

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:28.720
We received so many amazing
speaker applications

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.070
that selecting speakers
was a truly difficult task.

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:37.350
The lineup that we have today
should be both educational

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.660
and inspiring from a diverse group
of speakers from around the world,

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:45.790
41% of whom I'm excited
to say have a disability,

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:50.000
and can share experience beyond
just the able perspective.

00:02:52.040 --> 00:03:00.040
As of a few hours ago,
we have had over 1,900 people

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.300
from 68 countries registered
to attend this year's event.

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.660
So very exciting.

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.210
Before I sign off and the
event begins, I would like

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:13.360
to thank a few people.

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.110
First, the organizing team.

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:19.980
Joe and Bet,
you both have been amazing co-leads,

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.960
and I cannot thank you
enough for your contribution

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:26.010
to what is now a
nonprofit endless event.

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:30.990
Ryan Bracey, thank you and
your team at Second Melody

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:33.980
for leading our rebrand
and our redesign.

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.670
Joe Hall, along with Bet,
thank you for your contribution

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:41.260
to finding the sponsors
that make this event happen.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.380
Our other team leads, Isla Waite,
Adrienne Grace, Richard Gauder.

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:49.460
Again,
we couldn't do it without you.

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:54.300
As well as Alex Stine, Chris
Hinds, Nick Croft, Devin Egger,

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:59.850
Danielle Zarcaro, Raghavendra
Satish Peri, and Vicent Sanchis.

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:02.300
Thank you for your contributions.

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:06.790
We're already thinking about
WordPress Accessibility Day 2024.

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:09.850
If you would like to join us,
and you're an attendee today,

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:13.220
I would love to encourage
you to get involved.

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:16.540
There's an interest form on the
organizer page on our website.

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:19.560
You can go fill that out and we'll
send you more information next year.

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:23.570
Thank you, too,
to the amazing volunteers

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:27.790
who are making this event run
smoothly, from MCs to moderators,

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:29.900
and monitors in the chat.

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:33.120
Please visit the volunteers page
on our website to get to know all

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:34.600
of these wonderful people.

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.170
Unfortunately, I don't have enough
time to thank them all by names,

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:40.130
but they are helping
the event happen.

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:44.010
Of course, WordPress
Accessibility Day would not happen

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:45.530
without our sponsors.

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:49.580
Thank you to Platinum sponsors:
Equalize Digital and Gravity Forms.

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:55.250
Gold sponsors: 20i, Deque,
Empire Caption Solutions, Pressable,

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:56.840
and WP Engine.

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:02.140
As well as all of our silver,
bronze, micro sponsors, and donors.

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:05.790
Please visit our sponsors pages
on the website throughout the day

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:09.840
to learn more about them, and
also get swag and enter giveaways.

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.880
Our sponsors have a lot of
great stuff for you all.

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:14.890
And what's a conference
without swag?

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:15.990
So don't miss it.

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:20.450
Sponsorship funds and
donations are allowing us

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:24.740
to have live captioning and sign
language interpretation today,

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:27.349
and to get the recordings
professionally captioned

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:28.270
after the events.

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:30.750
This is a question that we’ll
probably see come up a bunch.

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:33.060
Yes, these are being recorded.

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:35.420
The recordings will be
available for you with captions

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:38.240
and full transcripts,
thanks to our sponsors.

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:42.540
They also cover the cost of Zoom
Webinars, and paying for software

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:45.540
that keeps the event
running smoothly year round.

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:49.830
I'm proud to say that with our
sponsors support and your donations

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:53.128
from attendees,
we increased our donation

00:05:53.129 --> 00:05:55.720
to Knowbility this year by $500.

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:59.750
So this year we were
able to donate $2,500

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:02.690
to Knowbility to help
continue their mission

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:06.300
of supporting website accessibility
training and education.

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:07.300
Thank you.

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:11.750
A genuine thank you to all of
you here today in the audience

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:15.110
who are interested in learning
more about website accessibility,

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:17.570
and are working to make the
internet work better for people

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:18.990
with disabilities.

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:22.600
You are making a difference
to countless people.

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:24.880
I'm going to sign off
now, but stay tuned.

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:28.240
We'll be back at the top of
the hour for our Keynote:

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:32.100
Conversation with Joe Dolson
and Jennison Asuncoin.
