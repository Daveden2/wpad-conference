 AMBER HINDS: WordPress
Accessibility Day 2023:

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:08.060
Ask Organizers Anything
AMA, Lightning Talk -

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:13.160
With Joe Dolson, Ryan Bracey,
Nick Croft and Amber Hinds,

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.010
Organizers of WordPress
Accessibility Day.

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:19.940
This session was recorded
on September 28th, 2023.

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.210
 RONAK GANATRA: Thank
you to Equalize Digital

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.090
for being the platinum sponsor
of WordPress Accessibility Day.

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:33.570
And now the third session
is about Lightning Talk -

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.240
Ask Organizers Anything.

00:00:42.618 --> 00:00:46.689
 SPEAKER 1: WordPress Accessibility
Day 2023, Organizer AMA.

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.130
First off, Luna Barbara asks,
if you were giving advice

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:51.840
to a web developer trying to
start up accessibility initiatives

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.320
and projects at their current
job, what advice would you give?

00:00:55.333 --> 00:00:57.420
 RYAN BRACEY: Hey
there, I'm Ryan Bracey.

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.080
If you're looking to introduce
accessibility initiatives

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.680
at your company,
the first thing you're going to want

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.580
to do is educate yourself on the
basic principles and guidelines

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:09.320
of the Web Content Accessibility
Guidelines or WCAG.

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.150
As soon as you introduce this
initiative, you're naturally going

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.970
to just become your company's
go-to accessibility expert.

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.580
So building a really solid
knowledge foundation is going

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.380
to be really critical
to your success here.

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.140
It's also important to
remember that accessibility

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.400
isn't a perfect science,
it's more like a moving target.

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.360
So staying up to date on
emerging trends is going

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.380
to be really important as well.

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:40.350
Make sure you participate in meetups,
attend conferences like this one,

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.240
and join some community
Slack channels.

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.580
All of this is going to really
give you invaluable knowledge

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.410
and insight as things
evolve over time.

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:55.160
Once you have that foundation set,
and you go to present this initiative

00:01:55.160 --> 00:02:00.400
to your team, remember you're now
your company's accessibility advocate

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.420
and your team is going to be
looking to you for guidance.

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.300
So start educating them on
the importance, the benefits,

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:10.710
and the consequences of accessibility
compliance, and then try

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:14.070
to connect these principles back
to what their specific roles

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:15.980
and deliverables are
within their teams.

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.460
You'll also want to set some clear
accessibility goals for your company,

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:24.110
and then start helping the
different departments develop

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:27.370
their own processes on how to
best integrate accessibility

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:28.370
into their own work.

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.920
Most of all, you really always
want to be communicating.

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.390
Try to create a dedicated
space such as a Slack channel

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.100
if you have a company,
Slack workspace,

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.690
somewhere where you can share
knowledge, ask questions,

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.800
and just foster discussion
amongst each other.

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.762
By following this advice
and constantly advocating

00:02:48.763 --> 00:02:51.202
for accessibility
within your company,

00:02:51.203 --> 00:02:53.640
you'll be able to
create a significant

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.020
and positive impact on just
the overall inclusivity

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:59.460
of the work your company creates.

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.430
 SPEAKER 1: Tom asks,
how would a deaf or hard

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.230
of hearing person know if captions
omitted words, particularly

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.060
if the speaker is not visible?

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.700
I am concerned about the potential
for trouble when seeing do,

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.380
when the speaker
actually meant do not.

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.850
 JOE DOLSON: Hi,
this is Joe Dolson.

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:19.320
This is why accurate
captions are important.

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:22.510
The WCAG guidelines don't
explicitly say that captions need

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:27.080
to be accurate, but I'd argue
that if a caption isn't accurate,

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:28.720
then it isn't a caption.

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.130
The definition of a caption
in HTML5 is, a transcription

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:37.040
or translation of the dialogue,
sound effects, relevant musical cues,

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:40.500
and other relevant audio information
when sound is unavailable

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:41.830
or not clearly audible.

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:45.707
Transcription is a
precise reproduction

00:03:45.708 --> 00:03:47.750
of the meaningful spoken text.

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:49.554
Translation is a
faithful reproduction

00:03:49.555 --> 00:03:52.390
of the meaning of that text
in another language.

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:55.690
In either case,
accuracy is a fundamental part

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:57.460
of what makes that text meaningful.

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:03.270
Live captioning, because it is done
in real time, will contain mistakes.

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:07.150
But for any pre-recorded video,
if you don't take the opportunity

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:11.660
to ensure accuracy, you're explicitly
discriminating against deaf

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:12.940
and hard of hearing populations.

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:16.220
 SPEAKER 1: Whitney asks,
what steps would you recommend

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.500
a quality assurance
software tester interested

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.270
in 508 compliance testing
take, to get more experience

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:22.360
in accessibility testing?

00:04:24.167 --> 00:04:25.640
 NICK CROFT: Hey,
this is Nick Croft.

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:30.510
I've got a 508 trusted
tester certification.

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:33.130
To do that, I went to this website.

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:41.130
It is www.dhs.gov/508-training.

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:47.100
And on this website,
it has some information

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:49.740
about the trusted
tester training track,

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:52.980
some accessibility documents
training, and other resources.

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:55.510
So I highly recommend
visiting this website.

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:57.530
But the other great thing
here, this link

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:01.200
that says the new DHS training
self-enrollment portal.

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:06.670
If you click on that,
you can go create a login

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:11.160
with their training portal and
fill out all the information.

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:15.650
Go through the steps, and it takes
you through a whole training course.

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:19.150
The training course will
teach you to use the tools

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:23.580
that they've created, and teach
you to use the testing methods

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:26.720
that you have to
follow for 508 testing.

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:29.150
And then at the end of that,
you take a series of tests

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:31.570
as you go through and
you take the final test

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:34.160
and they will issue certification.

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:38.700
Through doing this, it teaches
you the compliance criteria

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:42.095
that they follow for
508 certification,

00:05:42.096 --> 00:05:44.980
and teaches you the exact methods

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:49.620
and tools that you need to
use to verify compliance.

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:50.360
I hope that helps.

00:05:51.133 --> 00:05:53.970
 SPEAKER 1: Chelsea asks, if we
use plug-ins, we run into features

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:55.867
within the plug-ins
not being accessible

00:05:55.868 --> 00:05:57.440
and not having the access we need

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.240
to fix accessibility
issues directly.

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:01.630
Do you have any favorite
lists or resources

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:03.970
to check on specific
plugin recommendations

00:06:03.971 --> 00:06:05.300
or known plug-in issues?

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:08.410
 AMBER: Hi, I'm Amber
Hinds, and I'm happy

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:11.890
to answer this question about whether
or not there is a recommended list

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:12.920
of plugins.

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:16.160
But before I get to that list
of plugins, I want to start

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:21.810
by talking about some of the caveats,
or why it's really complicated

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:26.010
to create a list of plugins
that are accessible.

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:29.260
First of all,
there are a lot of plug-ins

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:32.380
that may have a very
accessible front-end output

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:34.710
or perhaps they have
zero front-end output

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:37.600
and they don't impact the
front-end of your website at all,

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:41.190
but they have very
inaccessible back-ends.

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:44.060
So if you're starting to
think about what is a list

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:46.960
of accessible plug-ins we can use, I
think the first thing you would need

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:48.960
to know is whether you're
looking for plug-ins

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:51.460
that create accessible
front-ends or plug-ins

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:55.140
that also have an accessible
admin interface for people

00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:58.320
with disabilities who may be
editing your WordPress website.

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:02.310
And then once you know
that, I think the next thing

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:06.160
that you really have to keep in
mind and what further complicates

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:10.130
creating this list is that
there are many WordPress plugins

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:14.630
that are accessible but only
with specific configurations

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:17.130
or settings enabled in that plugin.

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:18.253
And then of course we know

00:07:18.254 --> 00:07:20.240
in WordPress things are
constantly changing.

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:25.540
There's always plug-in updates
and things that are being modified

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:26.420
in plugins.

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:30.190
And so creating a list of
accessible plug-ins is something

00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:31.060
that could change.

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:34.150
There could be a website that
was very accessible today,

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:36.540
and I'll put it on the list
and then they release an update

00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:39.130
and it's not going to be
accessible tomorrow or vice versa.

00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:41.480
There could be one that I
go, I look at and I assess

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:43.550
and I say, oh,
this doesn't work very well,

00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:47.470
and then they release a giant
accessibility improvement update,

00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:49.490
and now it works perfectly.

00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:54.260
Keep in mind also that there
is a just a sheer number

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.620
of WordPress plug-ins
that are available.

00:07:56.620 --> 00:08:00.090
So I always have a hard time
when people ask me this,

00:08:00.090 --> 00:08:03.450
which page builder do you
recommend, for example.

00:08:03.450 --> 00:08:06.670
Well, I haven't tried all the
page builders, so it's really hard

00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:09.600
for me to go out and say,
this one is the best,

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:12.720
because how can I say it's the best
if I haven't tried all of them?

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:15.410
And so just the reality of
WordPress and how many plug-ins

00:08:15.410 --> 00:08:19.290
there are there, there might be
plug-ins that are really fabulous

00:08:19.290 --> 00:08:22.340
that I have just never
tested for accessibility.

00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:26.160
Now that said,
I don't want to leave you

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:31.250
with a super roundabout
answer and nothing concrete.

00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:34.700
So what we have done,
and we will put a link to this

00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:39.380
in the chat so that everyone
can have it as a reference.

00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:43.580
On the main WordPress Accessibility
Day website, not the 2023 one,

00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:47.430
but the main one, we have a
post up called, Plug-ins We Use

00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:50.680
and this includes a list
of all of the plug-ins

00:08:50.681 --> 00:08:55.610
that are currently active
on the 2023 event site.

00:08:55.610 --> 00:08:58.430
So if you're interested in
that, you can go check that out.

00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:02.040
 SPEAKER 1: Taeke asks,
Dark Mode, Yay or Nay?

00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:05.920
Is Dark Mode a fancy feature
or a web accessibility must?

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:10.230
 NICK: Hopefully you have seen the
WordPress Accessibility Day website,

00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:14.400
and we created this with
Dark Mode and Light Mode.

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:17.900
I can toggle this off,
and you get the Light Mode setting

00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:19.250
and then toggle it back on.

00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:27.360
With Dark Mode, it's best if
we listen to the user's request

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:32.400
so you can set prefers Dark Color
Scheme, prefers Light Color Scheme,

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:33.760
and enable that.

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:35.740
And we can do that
via media queries,

00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:38.390
and we can also get that
information in JavaScript.

00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:43.200
With this website, we also added
the ability to switch modes,

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:45.210
and that's not necessary.

00:09:45.210 --> 00:09:50.120
And in some cases, a lot of users
don't really switch back and forth

00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:52.730
between different things,
but having the ability

00:09:52.730 --> 00:09:57.290
to honor the user's request is
important for accessibility.

00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:04.230
I did a big talk about this with the
WordPress Accessibility Meetup Group.

00:10:06.090 --> 00:10:08.960
So in the WordPress Accessibility
Meetup Group, you can search

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:12.400
for past events and find Dark,
Light, and Inverted Developers Guide

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:13.910
to Color Modes with Nick Croft.

00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:16.950
It's got some information
on here about that.

00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:21.350
And then if you scroll in
and look for the comments,

00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:26.620
there's a comment that says,
find the recap here, which takes you

00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:29.510
to the page on
equalizeddigital.com.

00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:35.310
On this page, it's also dark, light,
and inverted, developers guide

00:10:35.310 --> 00:10:37.600
to color modes with Nick Croft.

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:41.410
And got a little bit of information
about here, about the meetup,

00:10:41.410 --> 00:10:43.760
and then down at the bottom,
you can watch the recording.

00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:47.740
In this recording, I go into a lot
of details about the importance

00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:50.640
of using media queries
to honor user requests,

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:53.490
and how that is an
accessibility bonus for people.

00:10:54.710 --> 00:10:57.800
For me, I prefer dark
mode as a personal thing.

00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:02.250
And it is not detrimental to
my ability to consume content.

00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:06.210
For some other users,
dark mode is extremely important

00:11:06.210 --> 00:11:08.340
to their ability
to consume content.

00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:13.860
Light sensitivity and other
disabilities can make it difficult

00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:18.400
for them to use a very bright
background like this with white text,

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:21.500
where a dark mode background,
more like what we have

00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:26.960
on the WordPress Accessibility
Day website, works great for them.

00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:32.290
So I do believe that it is
a web accessibility benefit,

00:11:32.290 --> 00:11:35.280
but it is not currently something
that will cause your site to fail

00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:35.960
and accessibility.

00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:38.970
So this is a bonus
that we give to users.

00:11:38.970 --> 00:11:42.200
As things evolve and grow in the
future, we may see changes to that,

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:46.440
but right now it's definitely worth
investigating and starting to use.

00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:47.160
Hope that helps.

00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:49.420
 SPEAKER 1: Chris asks,
do you have any data

00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:52.570
about motor function disability
being able to mouse and hit targets?

00:11:53.433 --> 00:11:56.090
 JOE: This is a complicated
question to unpack.

00:11:56.090 --> 00:11:59.680
First, what data is important here?

00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:02.960
There's data about
people who have gross

00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:06.870
or fine motor function impairments,
but that doesn't tell us much

00:12:06.870 --> 00:12:09.080
about their use of a computer.

00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:10.850
We could go looking for
data on what percentage

00:12:10.850 --> 00:12:15.820
of these users are able to use a
mouse, but practically speaking,

00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:17.190
that's most of them.

00:12:17.190 --> 00:12:20.400
A lot of standard mice have a high
precision mode that slows travel

00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:22.590
and makes it easier
to target objects.

00:12:22.590 --> 00:12:24.670
Assistive technology
includes a wide variety

00:12:24.670 --> 00:12:28.800
of different pointing devices,
including track balls, joysticks,

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:30.160
switches, track pads.

00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:33.860
All of those can be used to
point at an object on a screen

00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:35.360
and hit a target.

00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:39.660
As a result, people with motor
disabilities are quite likely

00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:42.380
to be able to use a mouse,
at least in some sense of the word.

00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:46.470
I wrote an article a few
years ago about the myth

00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:48.640
of the keyboard-only user.

00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:53.340
We work very hard in accessibility to
make everything keyboard accessible

00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:56.160
so that you can use every
single part of a website

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:57.920
or an application
using the keyboard.

00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:01.980
However, this isn't really
about some theoretical user

00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:03.840
who can't use a pointing device.

00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:06.750
It's about time and efficiency.

00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:11.320
People with motor disabilities may
struggle to change interface modes.

00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:13.910
If you're currently
using a pointing device,

00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:16.960
you use the pointing device, but if
you're currently using a keyboard,

00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:20.880
maybe it costs you 15 minutes
and a spoon to switch modes.

00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:26.980
So if a control can only be used
with a pointer, you can use it.

00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:27.980
But what's the cost?

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.070
The point of making everything
keyboard accessible is

00:13:31.070 --> 00:13:34.980
that a user should be able to
use any control with the tool

00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:35.980
of their choice.

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:39.210
So getting back to
that data question,

00:13:39.210 --> 00:13:44.230
I think the most useful data would
be an appraisal of time lost.

00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:48.200
How much time has it cost this user
because they could only use a control

00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:49.590
with a mouse?

00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:53.180
Even if each individual action
is only a few seconds lost,

00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:55.760
that aggregate loss of
time could be enormous.

00:13:57.280 --> 00:14:00.560
Data about motor function
impairments that impact the use

00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:04.820
of computers is underrepresented
in common data sets.

00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:07.890
The CDC,
or Center for Disease Control,

00:14:07.890 --> 00:14:10.470
publishes a data
collection standard.

00:14:10.470 --> 00:14:12.750
It's the six standard
disability questions

00:14:12.750 --> 00:14:15.020
or the Washington group questions.

00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:19.970
That doesn't capture this
information in any way.

00:14:19.970 --> 00:14:24.160
It is focused on motor
disabilities that impact walking

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:28.260
and moving around or showering
and specific activities,

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:29.440
but it doesn't cover computers.

00:14:30.510 --> 00:14:33.830
So effectively, I don't have
any useful data about this.

00:14:33.830 --> 00:14:37.060
If I was looking for it, I'd be
comparing the time to complete tasks

00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:39.472
for users with motor
function impairments

00:14:39.473 --> 00:14:41.080
against a control baseline,

00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:44.740
so that we could really get a
sense of what the overall time cost

00:14:44.740 --> 00:14:45.540
for these users is.

00:14:47.633 --> 00:14:50.190
 SPEAKER 1: And Arnetia asks,
there are so many WordPress themes

00:14:50.190 --> 00:14:52.230
to choose from, and I would
assume that some are built

00:14:52.230 --> 00:14:54.990
with accessibility in
mind while others are not.

00:14:54.990 --> 00:14:57.930
Do you have any tips for finding and
choosing a more accessible theme?

00:14:57.930 --> 00:15:00.600
What criteria should average
WordPress users look for

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:01.360
when choosing a theme?

00:15:02.067 --> 00:15:05.490
 AMBER: A good place to start
is looking at the requirements

00:15:05.490 --> 00:15:08.570
of the accessibility ready tag.

00:15:08.570 --> 00:15:11.700
The accessibility ready tag is
something I think developers

00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:15.080
who are submitting free plugins
WordPress.org can optionally go

00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:17.040
through a review in
order to get that tag.

00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:20.040
And I'm not saying you have to
start with one of those themes.

00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:24.520
What I'm saying is you can
go in the developer handbook

00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:28.270
and you can find what the
criteria is in order for someone

00:15:28.270 --> 00:15:30.420
to get the accessibility ready tag.

00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:33.550
And then that might tell you what
things you would want to look for

00:15:33.550 --> 00:15:35.200
in a theme as a baseline.

00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:39.870
Now, I want to be really clear, like
those are really just a baseline.

00:15:39.870 --> 00:15:45.390
It's not going to give you 100%
the best most accessible starter

00:15:45.390 --> 00:15:49.060
if you only look for those things,
but I think that is a good place

00:15:49.060 --> 00:15:49.870
to start.

00:15:49.870 --> 00:15:53.490
Things that I would look for if
I'm assessing a theme is one,

00:15:53.490 --> 00:15:56.260
does it have skip to content links?

00:15:56.260 --> 00:16:00.470
Two, does it have a
clear focus indicator?

00:16:00.470 --> 00:16:03.850
So you'd hit the tab key
and you would just tab

00:16:03.850 --> 00:16:05.870
through the website
from top to bottom.

00:16:05.870 --> 00:16:08.390
You want to be able to see
that outline and then you want

00:16:08.390 --> 00:16:09.910
to see that it goes in order.

00:16:11.060 --> 00:16:14.260
Now, if you know CSS, and you're
comfortable with editing CSS,

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:16.840
you can pick a theme
that doesn't have that

00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:20.350
because that's maybe a
two second fix, right?

00:16:20.350 --> 00:16:22.100
To add that outline in.

00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:24.720
But if you're someone who
doesn't know CSS and you're going

00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:28.640
to use a theme out of the box,
then you would want to try

00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:30.270
and find a theme that
already has a theme.

00:16:30.270 --> 00:16:35.860
Another thing that I would do is I
would test out the navigation menus.

00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:39.600
And most of the
non-block based themes

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:43.210
and navigation menus are
controlled by the theme.

00:16:43.210 --> 00:16:47.390
So you want to make sure that
you can access all of every item

00:16:47.390 --> 00:16:48.720
in the drop-down.

00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:51.690
If you don't know how to do
styles, then of course you want

00:16:51.690 --> 00:16:54.710
to look for a theme that
has good color contrast.

00:16:54.710 --> 00:16:58.660
If you know how to do styles,
then I sort of disregard

00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:01.460
any sort of color contrast issues
in a theme because I just think,

00:17:01.460 --> 00:17:04.020
OK, well,
I'll just recolor it when I use it.

00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:12.400
I would say in general, really
trying to separate what you need

00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:17.030
from that theme versus what's
going to come in a plug-in.

00:17:18.770 --> 00:17:23.060
So there are some themes out
there that are built with...

00:17:24.330 --> 00:17:29.520
they have custom builders or it's
a theme and it includes a form.

00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:32.850
I would always recommend that
someone go choose a form plug-in,

00:17:32.850 --> 00:17:35.510
and use a form plug-in,
instead of allowing their theme

00:17:35.510 --> 00:17:37.960
to create their contact
form, for example.

00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:40.970
You're more likely to have
better accessibility output

00:17:40.970 --> 00:17:44.750
if you choose a plug-in that focuses
on that one thing versus trying

00:17:44.750 --> 00:17:47.360
to get a theme that can do
all those things for you.

00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:54.460
Another thing along those same lines
is, I would tend to choose a theme

00:17:54.460 --> 00:18:00.370
that is more basic, and I don't
mean that it can't be styled

00:18:00.370 --> 00:18:01.740
and look really professional.

00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:05.010
It can be styled and look really
professional, but choose a theme

00:18:05.010 --> 00:18:08.450
that doesn't have a lot
of interactive elements.

00:18:08.450 --> 00:18:13.440
It doesn't need to have things
fading up as you scroll or flying in

00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:15.310
from the left or the right.

00:18:15.310 --> 00:18:17.070
Maybe don't have a carousel.

00:18:17.070 --> 00:18:21.700
There's a lot of data out there
that carousels are not required

00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:24.820
and in fact people don't interact
with them or they don't like them

00:18:24.820 --> 00:18:27.250
or they cause problems on mobile.

00:18:27.250 --> 00:18:31.220
So I wouldn't choose a
theme where the whole top

00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:34.840
of the homepage won't look good
if there's not a carousel there.

00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:36.360
I hope that gives you
a good starting point.

00:18:37.550 --> 00:18:40.510

session and you can see the updates
