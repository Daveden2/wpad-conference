00:00:01.085 --> 00:00:05.110
<v Amber Hinds> WordPress
Accessibility Day 2023.

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:09.400
Alt Text in the Age of Automation:
How’s it Actually Going?

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:15.150
With speaker Caroline Desrosiers,
founder and CEO of Scribely.

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.940
This presentation was
recorded September 27th, 2023.

00:00:23.822 --> 00:00:26.742
<v Caroline Desrosiers> Let me
share my slides with you all.

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:34.820
OK.

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:35.930
All right.

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.040
Hope that's coming through OK.

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.120
Hi, everyone.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.812
Caroline Desrosiers from Scribely,

00:00:41.813 --> 00:00:44.980
and this session is
all about Alt Text

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:46.930
in the Age of Automation.

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:48.730
Just a little bit about myself.

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:52.670
I'm based in Northern California,
and I'm the founder and CEO

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.690
of my company that's been in
business for almost four years

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:57.970
at this point.

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:02.420
We focus on content accessibility
solutions for images, videos,

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:03.940
and podcasts.

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.170
This is my first time at
WordPress Accessibility Day;

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.110
delighted to be here.

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:11.140
Also my first time
presenting on this topic.

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.960
I'm an advocate for really
great quality alt text.

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.100
But there's a lot of interesting
things happening in automation

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.160
and AI, and it felt like the
right time to explore this topic.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:24.680
So let's get started.

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.810
So here we are in 2023.

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.970
And I'm going to go out on a
limb and say, most alt text

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.060
on the web right now is bad.

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.310
I don't know if you all
have the same opinion.

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:44.480
Happy to hear yours, but it's
just kind of not meeting the mark

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:48.050
when it comes to WCAG requirements.

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:49.690
The WCAG requirements
state that we need

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:53.130
to be providing an
equivalent text alternative.

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.660
This is the point of the
WCAG Success Criterion 1.1.1.

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:02.020
Very important alt text to get right,
and we're seeing a lot of missing,

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.030
inaccurate, and incomplete
descriptions just about everywhere.

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.980
I have two up on the slide that
kind of represent basic alt text

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:12.740
that we'd see coming from AI.

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:19.360
One is a person painting a wall,
and another one is maybe an image

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:20.260
of one person.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.740
So not all that descriptive,
doesn't really give us a lot

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:26.550
of visual detail,
and definitely not providing

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.170
an equivalent text alternative.

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:29.720
So those are just a few examples.

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.270
So let's say that again
just for emphasis.

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:38.300
Alt text must provide an
equivalent text alternative.

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.120
And think about that for a moment.

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.920
What does equivalent mean to you?

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.580
And feel free to drop your
comments in the chat for everyone

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:47.580
to take a look at.

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.560
How can we write an
equivalent text alternative?

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.610
How can we truly replace an image?

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.530
So now just to go through some
of the top five alt text errors

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.970
that we see most commonly
occurring on the web.

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.960
The first is keyword stuffing.

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:08.780
This technique is really primarily
for SEO purposes, it seems,

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:10.860
because it's not all
that descriptive.

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:14.610
It involves actually just
putting in a list of keywords

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:18.750
to maybe rank higher in search
results, and here's an example I have

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.590
on the slide here for the
photo that's represented.

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.030
Person, rainbow wig, bold, makeup.
These might be keywords

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:30.530
that someone might search for
this image, but they don't belong

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:32.590
in alt text because they're
not all that descriptive.

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:36.318
We also see a lot of
overly-simplistic descriptions

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:39.010
that kind
of all blend together.

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.430
So that might look something
like, for this image, a person

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:42.190
with colorful hair.

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:44.340
It doesn't tell us a lot
about what's going on.

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:49.210
We also see some really bad examples
of image file names making it

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:54.500
into the alt text, just a string
of random words or numbers,

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.670
just copying the file name
right into the alt text.

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:00.520
Formulate descriptions.

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:02.120
This is a big one.

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:07.950
So this involves some sort of
combination of different terms

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:10.330
or components.

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:15.320
For example, product plus title
plus color equals alt text.

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:17.957
So in this case,
if we were advertising the wig

00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:20.842
this person's wearing,
it might say something

00:04:20.843 --> 00:04:23.600
like Long wavy rainbow
wig, heat resistant.

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:24.130
Right?

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:27.430
So something that seems kind
of awkwardly product related

00:04:27.431 --> 00:04:28.530
in the alt text.

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:31.550
Finally, we have AI-generated.

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:35.790
So a lot of the AI-generated
alt text really stands out

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:39.620
as either inaccurate or incomplete,
like someone hasn't actually reviewed

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:40.830
that alt text.

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:43.300
So here’s just a few common
errors that we're seeing out there

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:47.430
on the web contributing to
what I called bad alt text.

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:51.710
So just a little bit of homework.

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:57.680
And you can do this after the
session, or multitask and do it now.

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.430
I won't judge you.

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:04.380
But what I'd like you to do is
go to any E-commerce website

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:07.540
and check out the alt text
on both their homepage

00:05:07.541 --> 00:05:09.120
and their product pages.

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:14.100
This can be your favorite E-commerce
brand or business out there.

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:17.830
Just check into how they're doing,
and you can review the alt text

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:20.390
in a few different ways.

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:23.980
My favorite is through this Chrome
extension called Web Developer,

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:26.120
which allows you to
quickly view the alt text.

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:29.820
But you can also just right-click
any image in any browser

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:33.170
and inspect the image to find
what the alt text is there.

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:39.600
So take a look at that
and see what you can find.

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:43.020
I'm assigning this homework because
I'm pretty confident you're going

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:45.340
to find issues with alt text.

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:49.060
And I'd love to hear some
feedback maybe going in the chat

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:53.700
about what percentage do you
think, in terms of E-commerce sites

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:58.860
that actually have missing,
inaccurate, or incomplete alt text

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:01.830
on either their home pages
or their product pages?

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:05.220
If you could venture a guess,
what do you think the percentage

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:06.290
is right now?

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:13.780
Scribely actually did a study
on this that we released

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:17.570
for the last Global Accessibility
Awareness Day a few months back

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:19.350
in 2023.

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:21.700
And I really wanted to
collect some research on this

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:26.080
because I kind of had this unproven
theory that it's a whole lot worse

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:30.050
than what we're seeing from other
statistics about alt text out there,

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:37.290
like the WebAIM Million
study that says about 58.2%

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:39.360
of home pages are missing alt text.

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:41.610
I was seeing a lot more than that.

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:46.980
So we did this study to collect data
on how much alt text is out there.

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:48.152
And what we found is,

00:06:48.153 --> 00:06:51.110
not a single company
currently possesses a homepage

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:54.090
with content that is fully
accessible, meaning there was

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:57.660
at least one error that we
found with images and videos.

00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:01.480
And this is the top 100
E-commerce providers

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:04.140
in terms of their popularity
and search results.

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:08.270
Here are a few other stats that
I'm putting up on the slide.

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:12.291
For homepages,
27 had some descriptive alt text,

00:07:12.292 --> 00:07:17.620
only one had meaningful and
descriptive alt text for all images.

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:22.140
For product pages, the situation
was much, much worse with alt text.

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:26.060
97% had inaccurate, incomplete,
or missing alt text,

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:29.460
and only one had high-quality
alt text for every image.

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:34.130
So most of the product alt text
that we were finding was formulaic.

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:39.620
For social media, 12% of accounts
had descriptive alt text on Twitter,

00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:43.260
and 3% had a descriptive
alt text on Instagram.

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:46.940
I think the difference there
might be because of the Twitter

00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:51.080
or X alt button that was implemented,
where you can actually see

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:53.240
when alt text has been
added for an image.

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:58.840
So you can check out more results
from this study on the Scribely blog.

00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:01.580
But I wanted to put that up
here just so you can get a sense

00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:06.440
of what we're looking at right
now in 2023 for companies

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:09.634
that have actually arguably
higher budgets than most

00:08:09.635 --> 00:08:10.900
to handle this work.

00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:16.850
So we have to ask ourselves,
what's the hold up here?

00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:19.260
A few possible reasons that
I'd like to go through.

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:21.420
The first could be awareness.

00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:24.660
It's possible, I guess,
but most should know

00:08:24.661 --> 00:08:26.820
about alt text at this point.

00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:30.240
It gets a lot of stage time
at conferences, marketing,

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:34.480
accessibility-related conferences
, and there's a lot of visibility

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:36.230
into this accessibility
requirement.

00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:38.350
Expertise.

00:08:39.270 --> 00:08:41.660
Alt text,
pretty searchable at this point.

00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:43.980
There are a lot of guides
and tutorials walking through

00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:45.760
how to do this exactly.

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:48.120
So I think there's a lot
of information and ways

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:49.610
to develop expertise out there.

00:08:50.850 --> 00:08:55.150
Technology could be another
reason, kind of an excuse.

00:08:55.150 --> 00:08:58.190
But most platforms have alt
text fields at this point,

00:08:58.190 --> 00:09:00.600
so there is a place to
actually place the alt text.

00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:02.950
Budget.

00:09:02.950 --> 00:09:04.700
This is a big one.

00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:07.800
Yes, there are budget
concerns, but you know what?

00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:13.130
There is money to be found for
website copy, SEO, social media.

00:09:13.130 --> 00:09:16.690
Can kind of argue the case that alt
text should be included there, too.

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:19.020
Time.

00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:23.160
Certainly, alt text does take time,
but I'd also like to point out

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:26.120
that a lot of things
that matters take time,

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:28.320
and alt text is
definitely one of them.

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:32.800
So all possible reasons why
there might be a hold up here.

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:37.730
My own personal theory that's totally
opinionated is people don't like

00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:39.200
to write more than they have to.

00:09:40.870 --> 00:09:42.740
But who really wants to admit
that, right?

00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:45.770
So take it with a grain of salt
on the whole writing thing,

00:09:45.770 --> 00:09:51.300
but it might offer some reasons
why ChatGPT has become so popular.

00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:56.660
It's just this barrier to writing
that a lot of us experience.

00:09:57.870 --> 00:10:01.700
So whatever the reason may be,
the fact of the matter is many

00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:06.430
of the top organizations today
are using some form of automation

00:10:06.430 --> 00:10:08.920
to manage the alt
text for their images.

00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:12.930
And that's surprising because they
do potentially have higher budgets

00:10:12.930 --> 00:10:14.770
for this type of work.

00:10:14.770 --> 00:10:19.020
But I'd like to point out that taking
shortcuts doesn't change the rules

00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:20.980
when it comes to accessibility.

00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:23.190
Auto or AI-generated
alt text still needs

00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:27.430
to provide that equivalent
text alternative for the image.

00:10:27.430 --> 00:10:31.630
So these automated text,
they're missing the mark still.

00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:41.020
OK, so part one is, how exactly
do we tackle writing equivalent

00:10:41.530 --> 00:10:42.900
text alternatives?

00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:45.090
This is pretty much the
main point of alt text,

00:10:45.090 --> 00:10:47.720
so I felt like it was
important to start here.

00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:50.530
Most shortcuts that are
available for alt text

00:10:50.530 --> 00:10:53.970
don't actually help you do
that, and this is problematic

00:10:53.970 --> 00:10:55.270
for accessibility reasons.

00:10:55.270 --> 00:10:57.780
So we're going to start
this session off with,

00:10:57.780 --> 00:11:01.590
How exactly can we write alt text?
And I'm going to try

00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:04.020
to stay away from the basics
because there are a lot

00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:05.410
of tutorials out there.

00:11:05.410 --> 00:11:09.610
So let's get into it: alt
text beyond the basics.

00:11:09.610 --> 00:11:13.260
My definition for alt text is
a short, meaningful description

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:15.470
that captures the why of an image.

00:11:15.470 --> 00:11:17.970
Now, a lot of people
focus on the short part,

00:11:17.970 --> 00:11:21.580
and I'd really like to underline
and highlight the meaningful part

00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:25.980
because that's really the essence
of what it takes to write alt text

00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:29.710
that actually makes images
interesting and distinctive,

00:11:29.710 --> 00:11:32.720
and we're getting to
those unique details.

00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:33.790
Also, character count.

00:11:33.790 --> 00:11:37.460
Big question, and there are a
lot of arguments to be made.

00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:40.600
Sometimes there are platform
limitations, but generally speaking,

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:44.270
Scribely recommends less than
250 characters to write alt text.

00:11:46.590 --> 00:11:51.170
I'm going to walk you through
the actual formula that we follow

00:11:51.170 --> 00:11:54.740
for writing image
descriptions at Scribely.

00:11:54.740 --> 00:11:56.950
So this is an answer to the
question, What’s the secret

00:11:56.950 --> 00:12:01.110
to writing great alt text?
First up, there's a lot of work

00:12:01.110 --> 00:12:04.080
that happens before you
actually write anything at all.

00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:06.110
The first is to analyze context.

00:12:06.110 --> 00:12:10.600
So that's everything surrounding
the image, including text, images,

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:14.680
the page, the audience, you
know, really anything cultural,

00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:17.310
details that might be important,
that might be factoring in.

00:12:17.310 --> 00:12:18.650
Think about context.

00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:21.860
Next up, we have purpose.

00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:25.420
Think about the role that the
image plays for the audience.

00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:27.490
Why is the image there
in the first place?

00:12:27.490 --> 00:12:28.870
Why was it selected?

00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:30.330
What role is it playing?

00:12:31.810 --> 00:12:34.210
Finally, meaning as step three.

00:12:34.210 --> 00:12:36.680
Message the image
sends to the audience.

00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:39.890
So if this image could
talk, what would it say?

00:12:39.890 --> 00:12:43.050
It might say something like,
Look at this, buy the thing,

00:12:43.050 --> 00:12:45.270
or like me as an image, something.

00:12:45.270 --> 00:12:47.070
It’s trying to tell you something.

00:12:47.070 --> 00:12:50.020
Decode that message and that might
help you write your alt text.

00:12:51.370 --> 00:12:54.020
This also, I think,
really helps with writer's block.

00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:58.640
So I recommend not skipping this
pre-work if you are struggling

00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:00.350
to get started
writing your alt text.

00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:05.540
When you're ready to write and you've
gone through those pre-work steps,

00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:09.140
the question is, what is the
best way to structure alt text?

00:13:09.140 --> 00:13:11.470
And there is a formula
for this as well.

00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:15.582
First up, I always recommend
identifying the image

00:13:15.583 --> 00:13:16.810
in some sort of way.

00:13:16.810 --> 00:13:21.660
So this helps the user immediately
visualize the right information.

00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:22.510
Is it a painting?

00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:23.220
Is it a chart?

00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:24.590
Is it a graph?

00:13:24.590 --> 00:13:27.140
That can really happen right
away so we can get people

00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:31.040
in the right headspace to imagine
the descriptive details after that.

00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:32.880
The only exception
to this is photos.

00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:34.770
You don't need to say
photo of or image of.

00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:39.210
After identifying, think about
what is the focus of this image

00:13:39.210 --> 00:13:40.820
or the main subject.

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:45.320
Now this could be a person, a place,
an object, an artistic effect.

00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:48.310
What is coming through as the
most important visual detail?

00:13:48.310 --> 00:13:50.080
Where did your eye go first?

00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:51.680
That's often where the focus is.

00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:54.000
Then details.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.100
Think about the meaningful
and relevant details.

00:13:57.100 --> 00:13:58.160
So those are really important.

00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:02.230
You can't say everything and
keep it short, but you want

00:14:02.230 --> 00:14:04.410
to think about what
makes that image unique,

00:14:04.410 --> 00:14:06.210
and what details you'll
need to include there.

00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:08.790
Finally, read it back.

00:14:08.790 --> 00:14:11.520
Does the alt text sufficiently
describe the image?

00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:14.840
Did you actually provide
a text equivalent,

00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:16.780
or do you need more description?

00:14:18.710 --> 00:14:24.350
So let's see this in action and
we're going to use a really fun GIF

00:14:24.350 --> 00:14:27.260
as an example that I
have up here on screen.

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:31.830
So writing alt text from scratch
for this GIF using the formula

00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:32.830
that I talked about.

00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:36.940
In terms of an identification,
we can call this a movie GIF

00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:40.240
to immediately get people
into the right headspace.

00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:43.090
The focus is Gene
Wilder as Willy Wonka.

00:14:44.340 --> 00:14:48.430
And the details are the
motion that he's doing,

00:14:48.430 --> 00:14:51.250
his physical appearance,
and his expression.

00:14:51.250 --> 00:14:53.410
So these are all relevant
details that we're going to try

00:14:53.410 --> 00:14:55.200
to work into our alt text.

00:14:56.420 --> 00:15:00.570
And the alt text is movie GIF,
Gene Wilder as Willy Wonka,

00:15:00.570 --> 00:15:03.920
wearing a whimsical bright
purple jacket, decorative vests,

00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:07.000
and top hat, quickly props
an elbow up on a counter,

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:08.680
hand against his cheek,
flashing his eyes,

00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:11.020
and giving an insincere
side-eyed smile.

00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:14.610
So this moment is famous, it's
vary, it's in a lot of memes,

00:15:14.610 --> 00:15:16.730
it's the condescending
Wonka moment.

00:15:16.730 --> 00:15:21.920
And this description rings
then at 232 characters.

00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:25.320
Now, I did kind of color
in the lines and make sure

00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:27.170
that I wasn't getting
too interpretive.

00:15:27.170 --> 00:15:30.560
But when it comes to humor and
GIFs, I want to encourage everyone

00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:34.490
to really, maybe try to
bend the rules a little bit.

00:15:34.490 --> 00:15:40.580
He's clearly being sarcastic in
this moment, and it may be relevant

00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:44.230
to just call that out as the
emotion that he's expressing.

00:15:44.230 --> 00:15:47.320
So if it's important to the
story, don't be afraid

00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:50.940
to do some light interpretation
to get that meaning across.

00:15:52.650 --> 00:15:56.190
All right, so now we're going
to get into some automation

00:15:56.190 --> 00:15:57.540
and AI shortcuts.

00:15:57.540 --> 00:16:00.070
I wanted to make this
specific to WordPress.

00:16:00.070 --> 00:16:04.410
I'm going to go through a
few extensions and plugins

00:16:04.410 --> 00:16:09.500
that are using this approach,
and what exactly they're offering

00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:11.150
in terms of these tools.

00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:13.770
So we're going to go
through automated approaches

00:16:13.770 --> 00:16:16.380
and also extensions using AI.

00:16:16.380 --> 00:16:21.230
Before we get to that, first,
a philosophical question I'd love

00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:23.000
for folks to answer in the chat.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.300
It might be one that
you've heard before.

00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:26.672
The question is:

00:16:26.673 --> 00:16:30.360
Is better-than-nothing
truly good enough?

00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:33.430
And I want to hear
your thoughts on that.

00:16:33.430 --> 00:16:37.160
Better-than-nothing, meaning,
I’ve put something in my alt text.

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:38.530
There’s something there.

00:16:38.530 --> 00:16:40.270
I'll come back to it later.

00:16:40.270 --> 00:16:42.810
It’s better than having
nothing there at all.

00:16:42.810 --> 00:16:45.570
What's your opinion
on this approach?

00:16:45.570 --> 00:16:47.350
Is this truly good enough?

00:16:47.350 --> 00:16:50.500
As we've talked about before,
it certainly doesn't satisfy often

00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:55.500
that equivalent text alternative; but
beyond that, why is it problematic?

00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:04.750
In my opinion, I'm going to say
it's not really, truly good enough.

00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:08.230
And here we have a bugs bunny GIF.

00:17:08.230 --> 00:17:10.850
It’s the no GIF where
the no letters are

00:17:10.850 --> 00:17:13.920
just bouncing back and forth,
and he's making a long face.

00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:18.800
And I put that up because
it's really a no for me,

00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:22.330
and that's because the
alt text at that point

00:17:22.330 --> 00:17:25.030
still doesn't really satisfy WCAG.

00:17:25.030 --> 00:17:30.040
These quick-fix tools make it easy
to produce bad alt text in bulk,

00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:34.540
and then it becomes this overwhelming
problem that you have to fix,

00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:36.270
and you've done it for
all of your images.

00:17:36.270 --> 00:17:39.158
So it's quite intimidating
to take this approach

00:17:39.159 --> 00:17:40.690
and then come back later.

00:17:40.690 --> 00:17:42.690
The problem just grows and grows.

00:17:42.690 --> 00:17:46.430
So putting that off means
that you just have more images

00:17:46.430 --> 00:17:50.920
to describe later, more to go
back to, more that are coming.

00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:54.480
You're adding new images
potentially to the web all the time.

00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:57.910
That accountability of making sure
those images are born accessible

00:17:57.910 --> 00:18:02.120
is so important,
or the problem does grow over time.

00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:05.710
Finally, this kind of approach,
the better-than-nothing approach,

00:18:05.710 --> 00:18:09.630
really drives down this perception
of cost, where we talk a lot

00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:13.260
in accessibility about
executive buy-in.

00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:18.290
This delays work indefinitely, and
it drives down what it should cost

00:18:18.290 --> 00:18:20.360
to do meaningful alt text.

00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:24.870
Cost in terms of time, in terms of
resources within internal teams,

00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:28.890
or in terms of external resources
that are assisting the organization.

00:18:28.890 --> 00:18:31.770
So for all of these
reasons, I don't think

00:18:31.770 --> 00:18:35.230
that this approach really makes
sense, or is scalable at all.

00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:43.390
So this formulaic alt text that
we're talking about on WordPress,

00:18:43.390 --> 00:18:46.680
generally speaking, how this
works is there's a formula applied

00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:47.740
for alt text.

00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:52.193
So you have site names,
site description,

00:18:52.194 --> 00:18:55.480
and page title equal alt text.

00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:59.890
And you can use this kind of
formula to immediately populate all

00:18:59.890 --> 00:19:01.850
of the descriptions of products.

00:19:01.850 --> 00:19:05.540
I have a few product
images up here on the slide

00:19:05.540 --> 00:19:07.970
that are showcasing a robot vacuum.

00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:11.990
I don't know what brand it
is, but the idea is

00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:14.470
that we're looking
at a product image.

00:19:14.470 --> 00:19:17.770
The other part of these
plugins is that they integrate

00:19:17.770 --> 00:19:19.760
with popular SEO plugins.

00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:25.710
So they're very tight into keywords
or key phrases, and encourage users

00:19:25.710 --> 00:19:28.510
to actually include
those in their alt text,

00:19:28.510 --> 00:19:30.420
which often are not descriptive.

00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:33.920
An example would be
something that we see a lot.

00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:36.890
I'm saying there's a
lot of this out there.

00:19:36.890 --> 00:19:39.430
You have a sequence of product
images; you might hear,

00:19:39.430 --> 00:19:43.290
as a screen-reader user,
robot vacuum one, robot vacuum two,

00:19:43.290 --> 00:19:45.200
robot vacuum three, right?

00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:48.900
Just over and over and over again,
not giving you any details at all,

00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:51.160
but there's something in
there in the alt text field.

00:19:52.610 --> 00:19:56.140
So here are a few
WordPress plugins.

00:19:56.140 --> 00:19:59.530
Now I've removed the names of
these plugins because I want

00:19:59.530 --> 00:20:03.910
to maintain anonymity,
and this is about just understanding

00:20:03.910 --> 00:20:06.160
what's out there and
different approaches.

00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:08.368
But I'm also including
the activations

00:20:08.369 --> 00:20:10.350
because I found those interesting.

00:20:10.350 --> 00:20:16.330
This is how many potential websites
have this approach right now today.

00:20:17.410 --> 00:20:23.010
So the first plug-in example
has 70,000 activations,

00:20:23.010 --> 00:20:24.590
and it's the most popular by far.

00:20:26.070 --> 00:20:29.230
It derives the alt text
from the file name.

00:20:29.230 --> 00:20:31.520
It's possible to
customize that file name,

00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:33.740
but then you have
super-duper long file names

00:20:33.740 --> 00:20:37.600
that actually contain your alt
text that also go, not only

00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:40.180
in the image file name read
out loud by the screen reader

00:20:40.180 --> 00:20:42.390
but also in the alt attribute.

00:20:42.390 --> 00:20:45.970
There is an option to upgrade,
but then that only gets you formulaic

00:20:45.970 --> 00:20:50.350
or primary keyword
options with the ability

00:20:50.350 --> 00:20:52.810
to bulk-correct those formulas.

00:20:52.810 --> 00:20:56.830
So it doesn't get you much further
upgrading, and it's not easy

00:20:56.830 --> 00:20:58.410
to make changes or revert back.

00:20:58.410 --> 00:21:02.590
Once this action is taken,
you can't actually undo it.

00:21:02.590 --> 00:21:05.750
So that's really dangerous in
terms of populating your alt text

00:21:05.750 --> 00:21:09.600
with unhelpful or
brief information.

00:21:11.180 --> 00:21:14.290
The second option has
20,000 activations,

00:21:14.290 --> 00:21:15.950
and this involves the
traditional method

00:21:15.950 --> 00:21:18.820
of applying a formula plus
an SEO-focused keyword.

00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:22.901
You can automatically
override retroactively

00:21:22.902 --> 00:21:27.310
or any future images added
when that plugin is activated.

00:21:27.310 --> 00:21:31.660
So you can just with the click
of a button override any alt text

00:21:31.660 --> 00:21:37.180
that was written manually on
your site with this formula,

00:21:37.180 --> 00:21:41.830
and then it applies as long
as that plugin is activated.

00:21:41.830 --> 00:21:44.140
I will say there is
one plus side of this.

00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:47.720
It does provide an option to
customize at the post level.

00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:50.410
What that alt text is,
that's what we want to see.

00:21:50.410 --> 00:21:52.090
We want to see customization.

00:21:52.090 --> 00:21:58.250
But this risk of quickly overwriting
and changing your alt text,

00:21:58.250 --> 00:22:00.960
you know, I'm not sure how many
people are actually customizing.

00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:01.990
I would be skeptical of that.

00:22:03.650 --> 00:22:05.230
So thoughts on this approach.

00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:08.583
Problematic because
it repeats information

00:22:08.584 --> 00:22:10.030
that's already on the page.

00:22:10.030 --> 00:22:13.080
So we already have the product
title, and the product, and the size,

00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:14.160
and the color, and all of that.

00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:16.010
We don't really need to
repeat that in the alt text.

00:22:16.010 --> 00:22:18.280
It doesn't tell us anything else.

00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:21.160
It also fails to provide
much of any detail at all.

00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:24.510
So the visual details that
we focused on and we saw

00:22:24.510 --> 00:22:27.900
in the previous examples,
what makes that image unique?

00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:32.050
If it's a product image,
what does the different view tell you

00:22:32.050 --> 00:22:33.450
about that product?

00:22:33.450 --> 00:22:37.440
A lot of information is contained
visually within product photos

00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:40.600
that is not actually found anywhere
else within the product description,

00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:43.660
so we need to focus on providing
those unique details there.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:50.060
Now, this auto override makes it
impossible to fix, to go back.

00:22:50.060 --> 00:22:52.400
Again, it becomes an
intimidating problem to solve.

00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:54.720
All right.

00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:59.650
Next, getting into some AI-generated
alt text plugins on WordPress.

00:22:59.650 --> 00:23:02.125
So how these work is,
it automatically creates

00:23:02.126 --> 00:23:06.280
an AI-generated description
when an image is added to a post.

00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:08.600
And there's an option
to add product names

00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:12.280
and incorporate SEO keywords,
or key phrases from SEO plugins.

00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:15.730
So again, we're seeing a
very SEO-focused approach.

00:23:15.730 --> 00:23:18.800
I have an example up here on the
slide of two different images.

00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:22.220
Again, product-oriented
because a lot of these are.

00:23:22.220 --> 00:23:25.940
And the formula here is,
keyword one, keyword two.

00:23:25.940 --> 00:23:29.320
So this could be an AI-generated
keyword found for this image,

00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:31.820
or it could be an
SEO-related keyword.

00:23:31.820 --> 00:23:36.160
And this results in very
simple alt text with just two

00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:40.550
or three words like Oxford,
shoe, and bottle of perfume.

00:23:40.550 --> 00:23:43.060
And in this case,
there are a lot more details.

00:23:43.060 --> 00:23:48.220
It's a green suede Oxford shoe,
strangely positioned with peaches

00:23:48.220 --> 00:23:51.160
on top of a box,
but I don't feel that's important.

00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:53.310
And the perfume is not identified.

00:23:53.310 --> 00:23:56.420
It's Chanel number
five bottle of perfume.

00:23:56.420 --> 00:23:59.390
So that doesn't actually tell
us the significant details

00:23:59.390 --> 00:24:03.080
about these images that we would
need to know from the alt text.

00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:08.460
So a few AI plugins that
are in action right now.

00:24:08.460 --> 00:24:11.890
Not too many,
but they are out there.

00:24:11.890 --> 00:24:17.680
And I just like to say, this kind
of made me giggle, I don't know,

00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:19.000
in a weird way.

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:21.480
But one of them in the
descriptions actually said,

00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:24.180
Nobody enjoys writing
image alt text; leave it

00:24:24.180 --> 00:24:27.300
to our auto alt-tag generator.

00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:30.530
So that's a plug for my
theory earlier, right?

00:24:30.530 --> 00:24:33.066
Like, maybe people don't
actually like to write it

00:24:33.067 --> 00:24:34.260
and that's the problem.

00:24:34.260 --> 00:24:39.480
Clearly these plugins are
seeing that in their users

00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:43.790
and are delivering these
plugins for that reason.

00:24:43.790 --> 00:24:47.940
Going for the first one, there are
3,000 activations, so not quite

00:24:47.940 --> 00:24:49.370
as many as the other.

00:24:49.370 --> 00:24:52.410
And the way this works is it
automatically adds an AI description

00:24:52.410 --> 00:24:55.360
when the image is added
to the WordPress site.

00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:59.790
And it can either do this for
missing alt text or all images.

00:24:59.790 --> 00:25:03.490
It does allow human review,
but only in a gallery view.

00:25:03.490 --> 00:25:07.830
So we can't actually see the
context surrounding that image.

00:25:07.830 --> 00:25:09.710
We can only see it
in the gallery view,

00:25:09.710 --> 00:25:13.210
which may make it difficult
to write quality alt text.

00:25:14.460 --> 00:25:17.970
The next AI plugin has
a thousand activations.

00:25:17.970 --> 00:25:22.800
AI alt text uses computer
vision and common SEO keywords

00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:26.440
to formulate alt text based on
what it can see in the image.

00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:30.080
So it attempts to see what's there
and then uses the best keywords

00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:31.750
it has available.

00:25:31.750 --> 00:25:34.520
It also allows human review
but only in gallery views,

00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:37.110
so making it very
difficult to customize.

00:25:38.340 --> 00:25:41.210
My thoughts on this approach
are, these seem

00:25:41.210 --> 00:25:43.460
to be more about a
quick fix than quality,

00:25:43.460 --> 00:25:47.230
and I worry that people
aren't customizing.

00:25:47.230 --> 00:25:51.160
They aren't taking those steps
because that step of customizing

00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:54.700
and adding your own inputs is
actually quite challenging to do

00:25:54.700 --> 00:25:56.410
in context.

00:25:56.410 --> 00:26:00.270
They're not really providing
a way to do that seamlessly.

00:26:00.270 --> 00:26:03.810
And the AI is very short
and often incomplete.

00:26:03.810 --> 00:26:07.710
So we're seeing really basic
descriptions coming out of these.

00:26:07.710 --> 00:26:10.440
And SEO keywords are
often non-descriptive,

00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:13.904
so I don't think that that makes up

00:26:13.905 --> 00:26:17.600
for describing the
unique details of images.

00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:21.290
Sometimes keywords include
those, but often not; they are

00:26:21.290 --> 00:26:22.690
for SEO purposes.

00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:29.710
OK, so just a few ideas for plugin
solutions that I think are needed.

00:26:30.770 --> 00:26:34.680
We need better shortcuts, and
that's the point I wanted to make.

00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:37.520
There are pretty basic
ways that we can do that.

00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:38.410
A few ideas.

00:26:38.410 --> 00:26:41.800
Again, these are not available, but
I feel like any developers out there,

00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:43.710
maybe an opportunity.

00:26:43.710 --> 00:26:49.210
Flag missing alt text in both the
page and the galleries on WordPress.

00:26:49.210 --> 00:26:54.430
So just finding any missing alt
text is super helpful to users.

00:26:54.430 --> 00:26:58.230
And directing them to the exact
location where it's missing,

00:26:58.230 --> 00:27:01.960
this gives people the ability
to go in and write alt text

00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:04.450
if they inadvertently
missed it on their site.

00:27:04.450 --> 00:27:07.020
So that could be a powerful tool.

00:27:07.020 --> 00:27:09.750
Assistance with describing
images in context.

00:27:09.750 --> 00:27:11.270
This is really difficult.

00:27:11.270 --> 00:27:15.800
I feel like there are a few ways
that you could do this efficiently.

00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:19.960
One would be directing to an exact
location, as I mentioned before,

00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:22.200
or using a grid or
gallery view with links

00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:25.660
to view the context,
or pulling that in somehow,

00:27:25.660 --> 00:27:28.140
maybe pulling in the product
description or something like that.

00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:31.440
Anything with context that
helps give you a sense

00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:33.010
of why that image is there.

00:27:34.590 --> 00:27:38.930
Then options to bulk-export and
import to a page or gallery.

00:27:38.930 --> 00:27:43.700
This is not easy to get
alt text out and back in.

00:27:43.700 --> 00:27:47.850
And that's such a simple way
that we could have more control.

00:27:47.850 --> 00:27:52.000
It would make it easier to use
vendors, to work across teams,

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:55.750
use digital asset management systems
where we're storing our alt text

00:27:55.750 --> 00:28:00.060
or any sort of external tools
that we use to manage our images,

00:28:00.060 --> 00:28:02.870
and actually having that
translate to WordPress.

00:28:02.870 --> 00:28:06.880
So any one of these solutions,
I think, would be a better shortcut

00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:08.080
and a better step forward.

00:28:09.820 --> 00:28:14.590
All right, so getting into AI.

00:28:14.590 --> 00:28:17.950
Now, I'm going to talk about
the technology that exists

00:28:17.950 --> 00:28:19.050
outside of WordPress.

00:28:19.050 --> 00:28:22.890
So moving away from the plugins
that exist within the system.

00:28:23.930 --> 00:28:25.040
What's going on with AI?

00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:27.270
There's a lot of talk,
especially this week.

00:28:27.270 --> 00:28:30.780
I don't know if anyone's been
staying on top of the news,

00:28:30.780 --> 00:28:34.080
but some interesting things
have come out, to the point

00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:37.710
where I needed to check
all my facts today to see

00:28:37.710 --> 00:28:39.320
if anything changed.

00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:41.520
So I'm going to go
through, in this section,

00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:45.030
and talk about AI
alt text solutions.

00:28:45.030 --> 00:28:48.460
What I think could be used as AI
alt text solutions, from least

00:28:48.460 --> 00:28:49.790
to most promising.

00:28:49.790 --> 00:28:53.510
Again, in my opinion,
from my perspective.

00:28:53.510 --> 00:28:58.170
But we're going to go through image
recognition with confidence scores.

00:28:58.170 --> 00:29:03.230
This is an approach computer vision
plus natural language processing

00:29:03.230 --> 00:29:05.200
and combinations thereof.

00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:08.410
And then finally,
multimodal and large language models.

00:29:09.930 --> 00:29:13.650
So first up, we have image
recognition and scores.

00:29:13.650 --> 00:29:16.250
This is a really common
approach seen across a lot

00:29:16.250 --> 00:29:18.580
of computer vision tools out there.

00:29:18.580 --> 00:29:21.960
And the way that it works is it
identifies objects, places, people,

00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:26.320
text, anything it can identify
within the image actions.

00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:31.250
And it attempts to label
those, often with just a word

00:29:31.250 --> 00:29:34.380
or a few words, and then
apply a confidence score about

00:29:34.380 --> 00:29:39.360
how certain it is that that
thing is what it actually is.

00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:44.820
So you get this view into what
we have up here on the screen.

00:29:44.820 --> 00:29:49.550
This is a photo of a person
with some green boxes drawn

00:29:49.550 --> 00:29:53.210
around different parts of the photo,
and they really have this kind

00:29:53.210 --> 00:29:56.680
of interesting outfit with
striped pants, a leather vest,

00:29:56.680 --> 00:30:00.120
and a yellow sequined
button-down top.

00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:03.790
So very stylish, but the
bounding boxes that we're seeing

00:30:03.790 --> 00:30:07.700
are the actual components of the
photo that can be recognized.

00:30:07.700 --> 00:30:12.130
So we see here,
pants, 96% confident.

00:30:12.130 --> 00:30:16.370
Footwear appears twice because
there are two shoes in view.

00:30:16.370 --> 00:30:20.770
One at 92%, one at 85% confidence.

00:30:20.770 --> 00:30:25.890
It has 86% confidence in a person,
and 74% confidence in a belt.

00:30:25.890 --> 00:30:29.380
So it's attempting to see
what's in this image based on

00:30:29.380 --> 00:30:30.380
how it's been trained.

00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:38.590
The top providers that are using this
model are Google Cloud Vision API.

00:30:38.590 --> 00:30:41.340
If you want to test this
out, you can drop any image

00:30:41.340 --> 00:30:44.330
into Google Cloud Vision
API, which is how I was able

00:30:44.330 --> 00:30:47.180
to get some of the examples that
are featured in this presentation,

00:30:47.180 --> 00:30:48.180
and test it out.

00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:51.850
It looks for all sorts of things.

00:30:51.850 --> 00:30:58.430
It uses face and landmark
detection, OCR, object localization,

00:30:58.430 --> 00:31:00.810
explicit content flags.

00:31:00.810 --> 00:31:03.520
That's what it's designed for; to
actually see what's in the image.

00:31:04.580 --> 00:31:08.540
Amazon Rekognition is another
one, similarly looking for objects

00:31:08.540 --> 00:31:13.180
and scenes and activities, but also,
interestingly enough, celebrities.

00:31:13.180 --> 00:31:15.470
That's a key part of
Amazon Rekognition

00:31:15.471 --> 00:31:18.130
and the way that it's useful
and has been trained.

00:31:19.220 --> 00:31:20.180
Clearfy [phonetic]

00:31:20.180 --> 00:31:21.150
is another big one.

00:31:21.150 --> 00:31:23.990
It identifies concepts in images.

00:31:23.990 --> 00:31:28.480
And it's trained in over 10,000
concepts and 20 million images.

00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:31.800
So it's looking for
objects, themes, moods,

00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:34.490
which may yield a different
result than the others.

00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:37.950
So thoughts on this approach.

00:31:37.950 --> 00:31:41.220
I think it's useful for
object ID and keywording.

00:31:41.220 --> 00:31:45.170
So actually finding
objects within images

00:31:45.170 --> 00:31:48.090
that the information
contained there.

00:31:48.090 --> 00:31:50.260
We can get some really
good details and keywords

00:31:50.260 --> 00:31:52.290
for search results this way.

00:31:53.350 --> 00:31:57.120
But I think it's difficult to
visualize a list of words, right?

00:31:57.120 --> 00:31:59.440
We have this list of
words, and it is

00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:01.509
maybe identifying
everything appropriately,

00:32:01.510 --> 00:32:02.920
but we still don't understand

00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:06.680
what's there, and we're
missing some critical details

00:32:06.680 --> 00:32:08.690
on how everything
stitches together.

00:32:08.690 --> 00:32:13.530
It's seeing pants and belt,
but the whole ensemble

00:32:13.530 --> 00:32:17.260
that guy wearing was really
quite cool, and it's missing all

00:32:17.260 --> 00:32:21.000
of those fun, unique visual
details contained within the image.

00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:27.970
I am not feeling all that
confident in the confidence scores,

00:32:27.970 --> 00:32:28.950
just in my review.

00:32:28.950 --> 00:32:31.050
I'm interested to hear
others' thoughts there.

00:32:31.050 --> 00:32:35.070
I don't know how these
confidence scores are determined,

00:32:35.070 --> 00:32:37.590
but they seem to be a
bit all over the place.

00:32:37.590 --> 00:32:42.130
So there's some distrust in
the confidence scores there.

00:32:43.580 --> 00:32:47.970
Here's another example, and I'm
going to use this image again.

00:32:47.970 --> 00:32:49.520
We're going to see it a few times,

00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:53.460
just as an example
for this AI section.

00:32:53.460 --> 00:32:55.140
So I’m going to describe it.

00:32:55.140 --> 00:32:58.000
It's a portrait of a person
wearing a pastel-colored wig

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:00.660
and bold red and orange eye
makeup, looking at us

00:33:00.660 --> 00:33:04.730
with a mysterious expression
that could be wistful or bored.

00:33:04.730 --> 00:33:09.800
And here we have the results
of image recognition.

00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:14.010
And what I'm going to
do is read the word list

00:33:14.010 --> 00:33:19.510
that is contained here, and see
if we can get anything from this.

00:33:19.510 --> 00:33:22.720
So if we strung all these words
together, we would get image

00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:27.610
of joy, sorrow, anger, surprise,
exposed, blurred, headwear.

00:33:27.610 --> 00:33:29.910
And there's a 62%
confidence rating.

00:33:29.910 --> 00:33:33.050
So I think a lot of emotion
attached to this image,

00:33:33.050 --> 00:33:36.470
and that's why maybe there was
some difficulty with identifying

00:33:36.470 --> 00:33:37.470
what's there.

00:33:38.150 --> 00:33:40.170
This person does have a
mysterious facial expression.

00:33:40.170 --> 00:33:41.550
That's why I chose it.

00:33:41.550 --> 00:33:42.720
It's an interesting example.

00:33:43.910 --> 00:33:49.800
Now, ask yourself,
would you trust an image recognition

00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:54.310
that is actually determined to be
very unlikely or 62% confident?

00:33:54.310 --> 00:33:55.310
Is that good enough?

00:33:56.560 --> 00:34:00.250
We need to be more
confident in the AI coming

00:34:00.250 --> 00:34:02.970
out of this particular approach.

00:34:04.590 --> 00:34:08.190
All right, so the next approach
is computer vision plus

00:34:08.190 --> 00:34:11.670
natural language processing,
or some sort of combination

00:34:11.670 --> 00:34:13.480
of those technologies.

00:34:13.480 --> 00:34:17.010
And this is AI-generated
human-like image description.

00:34:17.010 --> 00:34:20.450
So we're moving beyond word list
and we're actually attempting

00:34:20.450 --> 00:34:22.050
to create sentences.

00:34:22.050 --> 00:34:25.950
I'm not an AI expert, but I want
to quickly define these terms.

00:34:25.950 --> 00:34:27.290
So we all know what they are.

00:34:27.290 --> 00:34:31.840
Computer vision enables computers
to derive information from images,

00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:33.990
videos, and other inputs.

00:34:33.990 --> 00:34:37.800
Natural language processing is
about how computers interpret

00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:40.690
and comprehend human language.

00:34:40.690 --> 00:34:44.560
And image captioning is kind of like
the intersection between these two.

00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:47.753
So the image is encoded
into different features

00:34:47.754 --> 00:34:52.120
that are recognized, and then
decoded into descriptive text.

00:34:52.120 --> 00:34:54.720
So we're actually attempting
to string words together

00:34:54.720 --> 00:34:59.400
to make interpretations, to try
to comprehend, and manipulate,

00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:03.300
and go a step further
into image description.

00:35:04.990 --> 00:35:07.750
So a few providers in this
space, MidJourney,

00:35:07.750 --> 00:35:12.230
doing some interesting things
with their describe command.

00:35:12.230 --> 00:35:17.130
I'm going to start throwing
out dates just to emphasize

00:35:17.130 --> 00:35:18.240
how recent all of this is.

00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:20.990
On April 4th, 2023,
they released the describe command,

00:35:20.990 --> 00:35:24.380
allowing users to transform
images into words,

00:35:24.380 --> 00:35:28.060
and actually reverse the process
of inputting text-based prompts

00:35:28.060 --> 00:35:29.540
to generate images.

00:35:29.540 --> 00:35:34.790
So the whole hypothesis is, Well,
can we use these image prompts

00:35:34.790 --> 00:35:39.710
for alt text purposes,
and can it go both ways?

00:35:39.710 --> 00:35:42.980
If we use this describe command
going from image to text,

00:35:42.980 --> 00:35:46.650
how can that recreate images,
and different versions of images?

00:35:46.650 --> 00:35:49.320
So this is a really interesting
approach happening right now

00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:53.680
where we're seeing more
details than before.

00:35:53.680 --> 00:35:57.870
So entering this command
creates an image-upload option.

00:35:57.870 --> 00:36:00.740
You upload your image
and then hitting enter

00:36:00.740 --> 00:36:04.690
returns four different versions of
a description based on that image.

00:36:04.690 --> 00:36:07.090
And then you can actually
use one of those versions

00:36:07.090 --> 00:36:09.960
to remix the image based
on that description.

00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:13.420
So MidJourney is helping us
create different versions

00:36:13.420 --> 00:36:19.670
of images utilizing AI,
but the possibilities

00:36:19.670 --> 00:36:23.150
for alt text here could
be interesting to explore.

00:36:24.820 --> 00:36:29.680
We also have Microsoft Azure
with their Vision AI caption

00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:31.930
and dense caption option.

00:36:31.930 --> 00:36:38.080
So the way this works is the AI
is attempting to recognize objects

00:36:38.080 --> 00:36:41.670
in images but also string them
together into some sort of sentence.

00:36:41.670 --> 00:36:46.100
So a caption returns a
very short description.

00:36:46.100 --> 00:36:53.140
Here, we have a yellow toy
bus with luggage on top

00:36:53.140 --> 00:36:55.650
that's kind of moving
across a pavement.

00:36:55.650 --> 00:36:59.980
And the image alt text is A toy bus
with luggage on top. So not bad.

00:36:59.980 --> 00:37:02.290
We could probably go
into more details here.

00:37:02.290 --> 00:37:05.480
I think there might be an
actual bus in the background

00:37:05.480 --> 00:37:08.330
that's blurred out in all
sorts of funky colors.

00:37:08.330 --> 00:37:12.250
We can get into the style of the
bus; it's more vintage-looking,

00:37:12.250 --> 00:37:15.330
but that's the description
they have for the caption.

00:37:15.330 --> 00:37:18.110
A then a dense caption
works in a different way.

00:37:18.110 --> 00:37:21.050
So it attempts to see all of
the different parts of the image

00:37:21.050 --> 00:37:24.220
and then write a short
caption for each one of those.

00:37:24.220 --> 00:37:27.490
So here we have an
aerial view of a bunch

00:37:27.490 --> 00:37:30.920
of different colored glasses
with different liquid inside.

00:37:30.920 --> 00:37:34.970
And it returns a whole scene
description at the top that,

00:37:34.971 --> 00:37:38.500
which is, A group of glasses
with different colored liquid.

00:37:38.500 --> 00:37:42.950
And it's recognizing that because
it sees a close up of the glass.

00:37:42.950 --> 00:37:45.970
A glass with pink liquid in
it, a glass with blue liquid,

00:37:45.970 --> 00:37:48.080
a glass of liquid on a saucer.

00:37:48.080 --> 00:37:49.710
It's attempting to see
all of these things

00:37:49.710 --> 00:37:52.990
and then string them together
for a whole scene description.

00:37:54.270 --> 00:37:58.170
And it's looking at up to
10 regions of the image.

00:37:58.170 --> 00:37:59.840
So a different approach
being taken here.

00:38:01.090 --> 00:38:03.570
And a few others using
this computer vision

00:38:03.570 --> 00:38:07.960
plus natural language processing
approach, CloudSide AI.

00:38:07.960 --> 00:38:11.150
They are labeling, classifying,
and moderating images

00:38:11.150 --> 00:38:13.950
to also deliver whole
scene descriptions.

00:38:13.950 --> 00:38:15.990
Meta AI for Facebook and Instagram.

00:38:17.480 --> 00:38:20.060
There is alt text that can
be automatically generated

00:38:20.061 --> 00:38:22.330
for the images
that you post there.

00:38:22.330 --> 00:38:27.100
Identifying activities, landmarks,
animals, locations, relative size

00:38:27.100 --> 00:38:28.440
of elements.

00:38:28.440 --> 00:38:30.450
They've been making some
effort to improve that

00:38:30.450 --> 00:38:35.750
and to also deliver descriptions that
sound like they have been written,

00:38:35.750 --> 00:38:37.480
not just list of words.

00:38:38.620 --> 00:38:40.680
Filestack Image Captioning.

00:38:40.680 --> 00:38:45.190
So this returns captions
as a synchronous operation

00:38:45.190 --> 00:38:48.970
when utilizing the API, by just
running this caption command.

00:38:48.970 --> 00:38:50.610
So a few different
approaches there.

00:38:52.460 --> 00:38:53.460
So thoughts.

00:38:54.660 --> 00:38:57.820
These generally keep alt
text short and succinct,

00:38:57.820 --> 00:39:00.190
but that's not always a good thing.

00:39:00.190 --> 00:39:02.240
Again, we're looking for meaning.

00:39:02.240 --> 00:39:04.320
The descriptions are
often incomplete.

00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:07.760
Because it's focusing so much on
what is the most important detail

00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:10.990
to convey, it’s not getting into
the territory of the relevant

00:39:10.990 --> 00:39:14.160
and meaningful details
that make alt text great.

00:39:15.330 --> 00:39:18.390
It also is not able to
describe images in context.

00:39:18.390 --> 00:39:19.510
I'm just taking a look at time.

00:39:19.510 --> 00:39:20.610
I want to make sure we have enough.

00:39:22.320 --> 00:39:25.327
Getting into probably the
most promising approach

00:39:25.328 --> 00:39:26.770
that we have right now,

00:39:26.770 --> 00:39:30.740
multimodal and large-language
models, and combining these.

00:39:30.740 --> 00:39:34.060
So multimodal is combining
different types of data inputs

00:39:34.060 --> 00:39:38.070
to create different
determinations, draw conclusions.

00:39:38.070 --> 00:39:43.380
And by multiple types, I mean
images, voice, text, all kind of part

00:39:43.380 --> 00:39:46.394
of the same conversation
you're having,

00:39:46.395 --> 00:39:48.880
the way you're engaging with AI.

00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:52.740
And these are trained on
massive data sets that are aimed

00:39:52.740 --> 00:39:55.309
at recognizing, translating,
and generating text

00:39:55.310 --> 00:39:56.620
in a human-like fashion.

00:39:56.620 --> 00:39:59.660
So how is this progressing here?

00:39:59.660 --> 00:40:05.930
We have ChatGPT this week
announcing multimodal capabilities

00:40:05.930 --> 00:40:10.120
in ChatGPT for plus
and enterprise users.

00:40:10.120 --> 00:40:14.300
So soon people will be
able to input text, voice,

00:40:14.300 --> 00:40:19.650
and image prompts into ChatGPT
and have a conversation.

00:40:19.650 --> 00:40:22.440
And this is where we get
into prompt engineering,

00:40:22.440 --> 00:40:25.860
where you're fine-tuning these
questions that you're asking

00:40:25.860 --> 00:40:27.910
in order to get different results.

00:40:27.910 --> 00:40:31.100
You can actually test this
right now in Bing Chat,

00:40:31.100 --> 00:40:33.290
this multimodal capability.

00:40:33.290 --> 00:40:34.730
So I encourage you to do that.

00:40:35.980 --> 00:40:39.570
I did it this week,
attempting to write alt text,

00:40:39.570 --> 00:40:42.100
and got some very
interesting results.

00:40:43.250 --> 00:40:46.560
Here I'm using that same image
from earlier, and we have a GIF

00:40:46.560 --> 00:40:50.690
that's playing, and I'm asking it
to write alt text for the image.

00:40:50.690 --> 00:40:55.630
It takes a moment,
and then it quickly defines alt text

00:40:55.630 --> 00:40:58.890
and then attempts
to write something.

00:40:58.890 --> 00:41:03.260
So there is this process where
you are waiting for it to respond,

00:41:03.260 --> 00:41:06.520
but it's decoding; Yes, I know what
alt text means, and here you go.

00:41:06.520 --> 00:41:10.060
A person with multicolored hair and
loose curls wearing a blue tank top.

00:41:10.060 --> 00:41:11.190
So pretty good.

00:41:11.190 --> 00:41:12.920
Better than the others we've seen.

00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:16.290
What I did next was add some of
the details that it was missing

00:41:16.290 --> 00:41:18.130
that I thought were
important, and I asked it,

00:41:18.130 --> 00:41:22.240
Can you please include these details,
but keep it under 250 characters?

00:41:22.240 --> 00:41:25.500
And it attempts to actually,
you know, write the alt text again,

00:41:25.500 --> 00:41:27.960
and it comes up with,
A person with a pastel wig in pink,

00:41:27.960 --> 00:41:30.000
blue, and yellow curls,
red and orange eye makeup,

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:32.700
and a wistful expression
wearing a blue tank top.

00:41:32.700 --> 00:41:35.560
So I don't know why it wanted
to keep in the blue tank top.

00:41:35.560 --> 00:41:37.340
It’s really obsessed
with that detail.

00:41:37.340 --> 00:41:39.210
I actually wouldn't
include it in my alt text,

00:41:39.210 --> 00:41:42.870
because I think the focus is the
expression on the person's face.

00:41:42.870 --> 00:41:44.350
But there we have it.

00:41:44.350 --> 00:41:47.800
It’s actually a more
detailed description.

00:41:47.800 --> 00:41:48.980
A few things to note here.

00:41:50.010 --> 00:41:51.790
Faces are blurred from Bing Chat.

00:41:51.790 --> 00:41:54.190
So sometimes in your alt text,
it actually describes the image

00:41:54.190 --> 00:41:57.890
as having a blurred face, because
that is actually what it's seeing.

00:41:57.890 --> 00:41:59.980
Kind of an awkward detail
because it's not a blurred face.

00:42:01.090 --> 00:42:04.660
Also, half the time, weirdly,
it refuses to add more details.

00:42:04.660 --> 00:42:06.590
It says, Alt text should be
short, it should be functional.

00:42:06.590 --> 00:42:08.540
I won't add those details for you.

00:42:08.540 --> 00:42:10.140
But it only happened
about half the time.

00:42:10.140 --> 00:42:11.140
Really weird.

00:42:11.660 --> 00:42:14.670
You can use other terms like
visual description or describe

00:42:14.670 --> 00:42:18.350
instead of alt text,
but this may lead to interpretation.

00:42:18.350 --> 00:42:23.010
So I'm going to quickly move
through this, but actually asking it

00:42:23.010 --> 00:42:25.540
to describe the image
instead of write alt text.

00:42:25.540 --> 00:42:27.020
I'll read the first part of this.

00:42:27.020 --> 00:42:29.420
It said, This is a portrait
of a person who loves

00:42:29.420 --> 00:42:31.510
to express themselves
through their hair.

00:42:31.510 --> 00:42:34.020
Their face is not visible,
but their hair speaks volumes

00:42:34.020 --> 00:42:35.290
about their personality.

00:42:35.290 --> 00:42:37.680
They have a rainbow of colors
in their hair, from pink

00:42:37.680 --> 00:42:41.930
to yellow to blue. So it gets
very flowery and interpretive

00:42:41.930 --> 00:42:45.950
with details that don't actually
belong in alt text, but it attempts

00:42:45.950 --> 00:42:48.760
to get more descriptive
and also interpret

00:42:48.760 --> 00:42:51.480
what those descriptive
details mean.

00:42:51.480 --> 00:42:54.710
LAURA HUTTON: Caroline,
we do have a bunch of questions.

00:42:54.710 --> 00:42:58.710
So I'm sorry to cut you off,
but we are on a time schedule.

00:42:58.710 --> 00:42:59.850
<v Caroline> Sure.

00:42:59.850 --> 00:43:01.200
No problem at all.

00:43:03.232 --> 00:43:06.590
 <v Laura> Such a great presentation
of such a better understanding

00:43:06.590 --> 00:43:10.070
of what words should be
added to an alt text.

00:43:10.070 --> 00:43:13.130
But let's get into some
of the questions here.

00:43:13.130 --> 00:43:19.480
Angela asks: When is
alt text required?

00:43:19.480 --> 00:43:23.370
We use so many images
that are decorative.

00:43:23.370 --> 00:43:28.600
We do use alt text on any
images that are important part

00:43:28.600 --> 00:43:34.050
of the context of the text or
graphics with data or info in them.

00:43:36.380 --> 00:43:38.850
 <v Caroline> OK,
and what's the question?

00:43:39.860 --> 00:43:43.470
 <v Laura> When is alt text required?
 <v Caroline> Oh, OK.

00:43:43.470 --> 00:43:47.590
So alt text is required when it
carries any visual information

00:43:47.590 --> 00:43:50.510
that is important for
a user to understand.

00:43:50.510 --> 00:43:55.230
So when we are talking about the
details of a chart, or graph,

00:43:55.230 --> 00:44:00.200
or the trend lines, all of that is
important to include in alt text.

00:44:00.200 --> 00:44:03.200
It's also important to pay
attention to any surrounding text.

00:44:03.200 --> 00:44:06.160
If anything's already been
explained in the caption

00:44:06.160 --> 00:44:09.180
or the surrounding text, you don't
need to repeat that information.

00:44:09.180 --> 00:44:12.360
Just think of the way the image
is furthering the surrounding text

00:44:12.360 --> 00:44:13.230
around it.

00:44:14.020 --> 00:44:14.650
 <v Laura> All right.

00:44:14.650 --> 00:44:15.050
Dee [phonetic]

00:44:15.050 --> 00:44:19.880
asked: On a team page with an image
gallery, do you include the name

00:44:19.880 --> 00:44:22.860
of the team members
in the alt text?

00:44:22.860 --> 00:44:24.200
 <v Caroline> It depends.

00:44:24.200 --> 00:44:27.710
Does their name appear
below their image?

00:44:27.710 --> 00:44:31.830
Or is their image truly the only
way that you would know their name?

00:44:33.150 --> 00:44:36.848
So I think that's an important
contextual piece of information

00:44:36.849 --> 00:44:38.080
to answer.

00:44:39.670 --> 00:44:43.270
If their name is displayed
below and just be read twice,

00:44:43.270 --> 00:44:45.360
it may not be necessary to include.

00:44:46.450 --> 00:44:50.720
 <v Laura> If you go back to
Peter Ingersoll's presentation,

00:44:50.720 --> 00:44:53.910
he had a picture of himself,
and he did a great alt text

00:44:53.910 --> 00:44:57.580
of describing him,
a 60 year old white man with a smile

00:44:57.580 --> 00:44:58.930
on his face kind of thing.

00:44:58.930 --> 00:45:00.820
And then he put his
name in the caption.

00:45:00.820 --> 00:45:04.720
So yes, like you said,
if the name is under the picture,

00:45:04.720 --> 00:45:06.710
then you don't need to
have it in that alt text.

00:45:06.710 --> 00:45:07.710
So that's good.

00:45:08.890 --> 00:45:13.180
Anonymous asked: Just
curious which role or roles

00:45:13.180 --> 00:45:15.727
on a web team is
generally responsible

00:45:15.728 --> 00:45:17.490
for creating the alt text,

00:45:17.490 --> 00:45:21.380
such as a site owner, the content
creator, the web developer?

00:45:22.414 --> 00:45:23.694
 <v Caroline> Yes.

00:45:24.030 --> 00:45:27.720
It often lands with different
teams, but I say that it should go

00:45:27.720 --> 00:45:31.240
with the person or the team
that is closest to the content.

00:45:31.240 --> 00:45:35.850
So that depends on the
organization, but we definitely need

00:45:35.850 --> 00:45:38.630
to have writers in this role.

00:45:38.630 --> 00:45:41.750
You have to love to write to
appreciate alt text, love the way

00:45:41.750 --> 00:45:44.070
that language and
communication work.

00:45:45.130 --> 00:45:47.900
So it’s really something I
think belongs with the team

00:45:47.900 --> 00:45:51.260
that's involved in selecting those
images or placing those images

00:45:51.260 --> 00:45:56.090
on the page, because they have a
really good reason for that why.

00:45:56.090 --> 00:45:58.410
Why does this image exist?

00:46:01.300 --> 00:46:06.770
 <v Laura> Another question was:
What are the roll, tilt, pan?

00:46:06.770 --> 00:46:10.060
I guess you used that
in one of your slides.

00:46:11.300 --> 00:46:15.080
 <v Caroline> I don't know
if I understand exactly

00:46:15.080 --> 00:46:16.920
what you're referring to, sorry.

00:46:17.900 --> 00:46:21.340
 <v Laura> Well, the question is
what are roll, tile, and pan,

00:46:21.340 --> 00:46:25.280
and then there was a...
Looks like a correction of tilt.

00:46:27.270 --> 00:46:29.510
<v Caroline> I really don't know
what that's referring to,

00:46:29.510 --> 00:46:30.590
so we're going to have to move on.

00:46:30.590 --> 00:46:30.800
[chuckles]

00:46:30.800 --> 00:46:32.550
 <v Laura> No problem.

00:46:32.550 --> 00:46:35.830
Look in the chat, because I
believe somebody answered that

00:46:35.830 --> 00:46:42.980
with a description of what that could
be, whoever asked that question.

00:46:42.980 --> 00:46:44.310
We have two more minutes.

00:46:44.310 --> 00:46:45.410
Let's see.

00:46:45.410 --> 00:46:53.410
Anonymous asks: Is there a gap
of describing images, by the way?

00:46:58.690 --> 00:47:02.600
What a seeing person sees
and what a blind person sees

00:47:02.600 --> 00:47:07.760
in the alt text that a seeing person
could miss telling in alt text,

00:47:07.760 --> 00:47:12.120
like a sense that we don't use
as much as a blind person would

00:47:12.120 --> 00:47:17.220
to understand something in an image?
<v Caroline> It's a great point.

00:47:17.220 --> 00:47:21.870
We do need to continuously make
sure that the image descriptions

00:47:21.870 --> 00:47:25.110
that we're writing,
we're getting direct feedback

00:47:25.110 --> 00:47:28.300
from screen-reader
users, from blind users.

00:47:28.300 --> 00:47:30.890
Is this information
actually getting across?

00:47:30.890 --> 00:47:34.760
So it's really important to make
sure to collect that information

00:47:34.760 --> 00:47:39.360
from your users to get
that understanding.

00:47:39.360 --> 00:47:43.850
But, you know, leaning on different
techniques for image description,

00:47:43.850 --> 00:47:48.550
not just describing the basics.

00:47:48.550 --> 00:47:51.120
So feedback from users
would be my answer.

00:47:52.460 --> 00:48:00.379
 <v Laura> Well, thank you so very
much again for this presentation.

00:48:00.380 --> 00:48:04.210
