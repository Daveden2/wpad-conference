00:00:27.267 --> 00:00:30.800
 SAMYUKTHA CHADARAM: Welcome back
to WordPress Accessibility Day 2023.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.117
My name is Samyuktha Chadaram,

00:00:32.118 --> 00:00:34.860
and I am the Accessibility
Consultant from India.

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.680
Thank you for joining us
for Beyond the Visible:

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.340
Crafting Inclusive WordPress Events
for Those with Invisible Illness

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:45.110
and Chronic Disabilities,
with Birgit Olzem.

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:48.220
A little bit about her.

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:52.520
Olzem is a remarkable
WordPress enthusiast known

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:57.450
for her diverse background in
psychology, design, and development.

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:01.140
She has a strong commitment
to the WordPress community

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.050
and a passion for
sharing knowledge.

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.420
Over her 13 years of journey
of contributing to WordPress,

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.550
she has advocated for mental
health awareness, diversity,

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:15.740
and the recognition of
non-coding contributors.

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:19.920
Birgit is also a devoted
mother and a grandmother.

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.090
Recently,
she victoriously bounced back

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.460
from two total hip replacement
surgeries, proving that she is

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.640
as resilient as the
WordPress platform itself.

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.960
In addition to her work
in consulting, teaching,

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.160
and organizing events, she is
exploring surface pattern design

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.280
and fabric collection creation.

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.630
Her warm and humorous
personality add a human touch

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:46.930
to the digital world,
making her a true embodiment

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:49.920
of WordPress values and
[Inaudible 00:01:48].

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.270
Please feel free to add your
questions in the Zoom Q&A session

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.000
and we will answer them at
the end of this session.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.220
Use the chat to connect
with our attendees.

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.740
 BIRGIT OLZEM: Yes, thank you
very much for your introduction.

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.100
I'd like to share my screen.

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.630
Thank you, everyone.

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.680
I really appreciate
your presence today.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:22.040
I just want to ask everyone who's
listening and watching today,

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:27.200
did you enjoy the WordPress
Accessibility Day so far?

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.750
For this talk,
I invite you to embark on a journey

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:39.170
that takes us beyond the
visible and beyond the realms,

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.080
and the sign languages
interpreters into a world

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:47.050
where challenges aren't always
seen, but deeply felt.

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:53.720
I'd like to start with a question.

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:01.790
When we think of accessibility at
WordPress events, we often think

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:03.770
of physical accommodations.

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:11.360
But what about those invisible
illnesses and chronic disabilities?

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.730
This question is not just words,
It's an invitation to explore

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:25.530
and to emphasize a community
within our community.

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:35.020
A group of individuals who are
also maybe not visible sides

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:37.640
of their battles,
face hurdles every day,

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:42.860
and hurdles that can be magnified
when attending events like ours.

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:48.000
Invisible illnesses and
chronic disabilities are

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.524
as diverse as our community,

00:03:50.525 --> 00:03:54.220
affecting mental
health, energy levels,

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:57.610
sensory processing,
and so much more.

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:02.340
These conditions so unseen,
having profound impact on those

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:03.340
who live with them.

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:08.590
Today, we are not just going
to talk about these challenges,

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:14.430
but also explore how we as a
community can evolve, adapt,

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:21.050
and transform our WordPress events
to be a sanctuary of inclusivity,

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:25.760
a place where every member,
visible disability or not,

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:31.690
feels accommodated, but also
welcomed, valued, and understood.

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:37.930
So as we delve into this
important conversation, I want you

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:42.810
to keep this question in your mind
and let it echo in your thoughts.

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:46.270
And may it be a catalyst
for a transformation

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:52.840
that makes our community a
beacon of inclusivity for all.

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:56.490
And it's essential to
understand the perspective

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:59.550
from which this conversation
is being anchored.

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:03.070
Allow me a moment
to introduce myself.

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:11.190
On the right hand side on the
slides, you see a picture of me.

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:17.680
This was taken during the Ambassador
Talk on the International Book Fair

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:20.450
in Frankfurt, Germany back in 2010.

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:24.830
I was talking about how to
build a portfolio website

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:29.180
and build a marketing strategy
for self-publishing book authors.

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:33.390
And the photo shows me as a
female person in a white blouse

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:38.400
and dark cardigan, with short
brown hair, and wearing a pair

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:42.030
of sun glasses as
a kind of a tiara.

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:46.230
And me, the person,
holds a microphone in one hand,

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:47.670
and in the other hand a book.

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:54.010
The book was self-published
by me in 2009.

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:57.480
A bit more about me.

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:02.640
I'm a proud mother of five
children, and a grandmother of two.

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:06.680
Each of them are enriching
my life in unique ways

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:11.270
and teaching me invaluable
lessons about love and resilience

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:13.250
on a daily basis.

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:21.250
I'm also a professional entrepreneur
with a diverse portfolio,

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:26.490
and also an artist who
dives into web design.

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:31.300
Each role I play is like a
distinct color to my life's canvas,

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:35.860
and contributing to my growth,
and understand the world around me.

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:41.320
And I'm also a certified life
coach, wearing a lot of hats

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:45.180
during my time,
all my life's existence.

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:51.870
And I love that I have the
privilege to be a partner

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:57.640
in a journey of someone's life,
and to understand why we are here

00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:00.260
for the WordPress
Accessibility Day.

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:03.160
I’ve use WordPress
since its first release,

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:07.560
and have been contributing to
WordPress for over a decade now.

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:11.680
And so I'm deeply involved
into the community.

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:21.240
As we proceed, I’d like to
give you an understanding

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:24.870
on how this shaped my
perspective and my dedication

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:27.630
to WordPress and accessibility.

00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:33.320
But also, I'm a person with
chronic health issues, and I like

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:38.020
to share what's about
understanding invisible illness

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:39.580
and chronic disabilities.

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:48.240
So we are stepping into the
space where the unseen is brought

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:52.450
to light, where silent
struggles are given a voice,

00:07:52.450 --> 00:07:54.960
and where the invisible
becomes visible.

00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:04.870
In this moment, we will go on a
journey of explanation and discovery.

00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:09.930
And we want to discuss three
vital, pivotal questions.

00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:14.900
First, we will unravel the
enigma of invisible illness

00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:16.500
and chronic disabilities.

00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:19.100
And what are they?

00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:20.590
How do they manifest?

00:08:20.590 --> 00:08:26.140
And why are they often clogged
in silence and invisibility?

00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:29.320
Next, we will delve
into the intricate ways

00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:33.210
these conditions impact
event participation.

00:08:33.210 --> 00:08:39.310
And we will also explore the unseen
barriers, the silent challenges,

00:08:39.310 --> 00:08:44.740
the often unspoken needs that define
the experience of those living

00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:45.980
with these conditions.

00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:52.630
Finally, we will confront the
imperative of visibility in a world

00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:55.190
that often validates what's seen.

00:08:55.190 --> 00:09:00.780
And how do we acknowledge, validate,
and accommodate the unseen?

00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:02.510
Why does visibility matter?

00:09:02.510 --> 00:09:08.610
And how can we transform
experiences and foster inclusivity

00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:12.490
and build bridges of
understanding and support?

00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:17.620
Yes.

00:09:20.170 --> 00:09:24.240
What are invisible illness
and chronic disabilities?

00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:32.590
We are confronted with the
reality that invisible illness

00:09:32.590 --> 00:09:36.660
and chronic disabilities
are often overlooked.

00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:42.590
And these conditions are
not immediately apparent.

00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:50.140
They lurk into the shadows unseen,
and they do not announce themselves

00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:52.500
with visible signs.

00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:57.790
Like, you don't see any
crutches or a wheelchair.

00:09:57.790 --> 00:09:59.220
You can't see them.

00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:02.880
And that's why we are
talking about invisible,

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:08.200
because it's not that obvious
that someone is facing a condition

00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:13.280
which is not apparent to anyone.

00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:21.449
Also, they include conditions
like chronic fatigue syndrome,

00:10:21.450 --> 00:10:27.290
and the exhaustion which
comes with chronic fatigue,

00:10:27.290 --> 00:10:33.100
but also the silent battles
of mental health conditions,

00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:37.900
as well as complex challenges
of neurological conditions.

00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:41.750
And like also having
autoimmune diseases,

00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:46.240
and you don't have any prediction
how is your day tomorrow,

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:49.080
and how do you feel
in the next hour.

00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:56.870
For instance, I need to pace
myself to power through my day.

00:10:58.050 --> 00:11:00.190
And sometimes I
need to take breaks.

00:11:00.190 --> 00:11:06.200
And there's so much
we have to cover,

00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:10.810
that a lot of people don't
understand what it means

00:11:10.810 --> 00:11:15.750
to face an invisible condition
and health condition.

00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:23.490
How do these condition
impact event participation?

00:11:23.490 --> 00:11:30.300
I'm someone who’s really
interested in attending WordCamps,

00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:36.270
and I also face a lot of
struggles when attending WordCamps

00:11:36.270 --> 00:11:38.600
because of my health conditions.

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:45.950
And I like to explore what
it means to attend these.

00:11:45.950 --> 00:11:48.230
For instance, energy levels.

00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:54.370
I don't know if you know
about the spoon theory?

00:11:54.370 --> 00:12:00.910
When someone say, I just have
only three spoons left in a day.

00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:08.910
It is meant to be that we have to
pace ourselves and be really careful

00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:10.540
about our energy levels.

00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:18.540
Imagine charging of your smartphone
when it runs really low on battery.

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:24.830
So you have to be very
careful of what are you doing

00:12:24.830 --> 00:12:32.830
with your fully charged,
or half-full charged mobile phone.

00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:38.850
It is also the individual journey
through a WordPress event.

00:12:38.850 --> 00:12:45.550
It is because we have a kind of
silent dance of energy with apps

00:12:45.550 --> 00:12:46.980
and flows.

00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:49.590
But it is not visible to anyone.

00:12:49.590 --> 00:12:54.610
The same goes with
sensory sensitivity.

00:12:55.840 --> 00:13:02.540
Imagine you have a bright light
on the ceiling, and it reflects

00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:09.110
on your glasses for instance,
and it's really sharp in the eyes.

00:13:10.690 --> 00:13:15.010
And this is also an
overwhelming cascade

00:13:15.010 --> 00:13:19.320
when you also have sensory
overload, not only from lights,

00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:21.040
but also from sounds.

00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:25.880
If a sound is echoing in the
room, or there is too much chatter

00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:29.040
around you, and you need
to focus on what the person

00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:30.500
in front of you is saying.

00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:39.230
Yes, that's also the sensitivity,
reflecting on clothes

00:13:39.230 --> 00:13:43.780
that you are wearing on that day,
which can also give something

00:13:43.780 --> 00:13:45.220
on top on the cascade.

00:13:46.530 --> 00:13:49.520
Now, onto the cognitive challenges.

00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:53.560
I'll just like to explore
the issues like anxiety

00:13:53.560 --> 00:14:00.070
or other cognitive aspects that
are not obvious to everyone.

00:14:00.070 --> 00:14:03.990
But someone is dealing
with understanding.

00:14:03.990 --> 00:14:08.160
For instance, I'm a non-native
English-speaking person.

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:13.510
I'm from Germany,
and I have sometimes struggled

00:14:13.510 --> 00:14:18.530
to understand others when they
don't speak in a clear voice,

00:14:18.530 --> 00:14:25.900
or if they are talking really
fast, or have a strong dialect

00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:27.960
when they are speaking English.

00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:34.620
And so it is really difficult for me
to process what someone is saying,

00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:39.290
or to understand what
the person is saying.

00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:50.180
Yes, that's the cognitive challenges
on the language barrier basis are.

00:14:51.530 --> 00:14:58.890
Also, someone with different
backgrounds has also difficulties

00:14:58.890 --> 00:15:07.900
to grasp the environment, and also
maybe distracted by the environment.

00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:12.830
So that is also the
challenge someone faces.

00:15:15.830 --> 00:15:19.030
And that's why visibility matters.

00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:23.690
It’s just not a phrase.

00:15:23.690 --> 00:15:28.870
I'm really advocating for
visibility in and why it matters,

00:15:28.870 --> 00:15:31.820
and representation
matters, It's a movement.

00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:39.200
And I like it also to be a call
of action, that we are rooting

00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:46.660
for those facing those challenges,
and we also want to create awareness

00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:51.020
so that someone gets more
empathy and understanding.

00:15:51.020 --> 00:15:55.800
And also to reducing the
stigma and the misconceptions

00:15:55.800 --> 00:16:01.280
around invisible health conditions.

00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:09.280
And also illuminating the pathways
where judgment hopefully fades away.

00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:22.050
But also to ensure that we
tailor our accommodations

00:16:22.050 --> 00:16:28.070
as WordPress event organizers,
and also fostering participation

00:16:28.070 --> 00:16:30.460
and contribution to those events.

00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:38.030
How we can accommodate
during a WordPress event

00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:42.140
like the WP Accessibility,
for instance.

00:16:42.140 --> 00:16:45.530
The organizing team did
a great job to make it

00:16:45.530 --> 00:16:49.670
as inclusive and
accessible as possible.

00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:57.190
That’s because they listen to
the challenges someone faces

00:16:57.190 --> 00:17:03.550
while attending,
but also participating on an event.

00:17:05.860 --> 00:17:12.350
This is also a space where
diverse voices aren't just heard,

00:17:12.350 --> 00:17:19.610
but also amplified, and it's not
just a concept, but also a living,

00:17:19.610 --> 00:17:22.470
breathing entity.

00:17:24.690 --> 00:17:30.790
Empowerment isn't just a gift we
offer; it's a space we create,

00:17:30.790 --> 00:17:34.870
where every member of our
community can sense the power

00:17:34.870 --> 00:17:38.600
of their truth and their
own yielding potential.

00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:44.717
This is why I think
it's very important

00:17:44.718 --> 00:17:47.490
that we empower our attendees,

00:17:47.490 --> 00:17:55.330
and that we also are
empathetic about it, to learn,

00:17:55.330 --> 00:17:58.980
and be also open-minded
to learn more about it.

00:18:00.350 --> 00:18:06.640
When we think about
invisible conditions.

00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:10.960
I like to transition to an analogy.

00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:17.280
I find it really simple,
because it compares as a bridge

00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:21.260
between the tangible and
intangible, and the seen and unseen.

00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:29.470
Invisible disabilities
are like a Wi-Fi signal.

00:18:29.470 --> 00:18:33.760
Picture this: You walk into a
room, your device in one hand,

00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:37.930
and there are no visible cords,
no tangible connections yet,

00:18:37.930 --> 00:18:41.120
In the silence and
in the invisibility,

00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:47.380
there's a powerful signal enabling
a communication, connection,

00:18:47.380 --> 00:18:48.440
and interaction.

00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:50.730
But do you see it?

00:18:52.030 --> 00:18:53.560
Do you see it really?

00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:54.950
Can you grasp it?

00:18:54.950 --> 00:18:55.950
Can you grab it?

00:18:57.380 --> 00:19:03.290
Just like Wi-Fi, invisible
disabilities are in our spaces,

00:19:03.290 --> 00:19:05.970
in our communities, in our events.

00:19:05.970 --> 00:19:11.180
And they may not be seen,
but they are deeply felt.

00:19:11.180 --> 00:19:18.290
And they may not be heard, but they
are profoundly impacting experiences

00:19:18.290 --> 00:19:21.530
and interaction,
and also engagement.

00:19:25.210 --> 00:19:25.960
Think about it.

00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:30.450
We don't question the existence
or the impact of a Wi-Fi signal,

00:19:32.230 --> 00:19:34.850
even if it's invisible.

00:19:34.850 --> 00:19:39.530
But we acknowledge it's presence,
and we adapt our actions

00:19:39.530 --> 00:19:44.730
and our spaces, but also our
technologies to handle the power

00:19:44.730 --> 00:19:49.590
of a Wi-Fi signal,
and to facilitate a connection,

00:19:49.590 --> 00:19:52.290
and to bridge distances.

00:19:52.290 --> 00:19:57.760
Similarly, the invisibility
of a certain disability

00:19:57.760 --> 00:20:02.790
should not negate our
existence or their existence

00:20:02.790 --> 00:20:04.650
or dilute their significance.

00:20:06.210 --> 00:20:10.830
So acknowledging that
invisible disabilities

00:20:10.830 --> 00:20:17.850
or invisible conditions exist,
and that we accommodate this

00:20:17.850 --> 00:20:22.340
because they're there even
if we are not on the surface.

00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:31.590
It is crucial that we ground our
understanding and empathy in numbers.

00:20:34.090 --> 00:20:41.700
I did a short research and I
found that one 1.3 billion people,

00:20:43.910 --> 00:20:49.960
about 16% of the global population,
are living with a severe disability.

00:20:51.380 --> 00:20:55.380
And even if each number of
this statistics is a person

00:20:55.380 --> 00:21:00.070
and individual with
experiences and challenges,

00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:05.350
and the contributions are as
diverse as they are significant,

00:21:05.350 --> 00:21:09.840
it's difficult to understand
that they are not visible.

00:21:11.780 --> 00:21:14.780
Also, when we think about
disabilities, the image

00:21:14.780 --> 00:21:16.700
of a wheelchair often prevails.

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.020
And it's a visible symbol.

00:21:20.020 --> 00:21:27.090
We are presenting accessibility
by presenting it with iconography

00:21:27.090 --> 00:21:33.850
of a wheelchair, but it represents
only 2% of people with disabilities.

00:21:35.050 --> 00:21:40.160
The overwhelming majority
are a full 80% grappling

00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:42.860
with invisible disabilities.

00:21:42.860 --> 00:21:49.650
And they also navigate a world where
their challenges, even though unseen,

00:21:49.650 --> 00:21:55.150
are as real and as impactful
as any visible disability.

00:21:56.960 --> 00:22:01.890
Yes, many of them are active
in the WordPress community.

00:22:01.890 --> 00:22:05.230
They are developers,
designers, users, contributors,

00:22:05.230 --> 00:22:11.820
and they enrich our community
with their skills, insights,

00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:12.820
and perspectives.

00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:18.240
Their invisible disabilities are
not barriers to their contributions,

00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:23.110
but they are also aspects
of their identity.

00:22:23.110 --> 00:22:25.792
And they also deserve
acknowledgement,

00:22:25.793 --> 00:22:28.130
understanding, and accommodation.

00:22:33.710 --> 00:22:37.900
As we move forward,
let's take a moment to delve

00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:43.170
into the specific types of
invisible health conditions.

00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:48.370
While the spectrum is
really vast and diverse,

00:22:48.370 --> 00:22:54.090
we will also focus on a select
to provide you a glimpse

00:22:54.090 --> 00:22:56.220
of the experiences.

00:22:58.790 --> 00:23:06.790
For this example, I picked some
well-known conditions like MECFS,

00:23:09.030 --> 00:23:16.190
Long COVID, CPTSD,
ADHD and Autism Spectrum Disorders.

00:23:16.190 --> 00:23:20.930
Each of these conditions,
even though invisible as profound,

00:23:20.930 --> 00:23:25.920
they have an impact on the life
of everyone who's facing them.

00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:30.570
And I just want to emphasize that
this is not an exhaustive list.

00:23:30.570 --> 00:23:35.102
The spectrum of invisible
health conditions is diverse

00:23:35.103 --> 00:23:36.750
as humanity itself.

00:23:36.750 --> 00:23:42.480
And each individual experience is
unique and shaped by the interplay

00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:47.470
of their condition, and environment,
and personal resilience.

00:23:47.470 --> 00:23:53.110
I would like to talk
first about MECFS.

00:23:53.110 --> 00:23:58.860
It's a topic close to my heart
because I'm currently also suffering

00:23:58.860 --> 00:24:00.370
on that.

00:24:00.370 --> 00:24:08.370
And it's the abbreviation of
myalgic encephalomyelitis,

00:24:08.570 --> 00:24:10.880
or chronic fatigue syndrome.

00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:16.630
And it's also a condition
characterized by really heavy fatigue

00:24:16.630 --> 00:24:21.010
that you can't accommodate
with more sleep.

00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:27.510
And this deep exhaustion,
what you're facing,

00:24:27.510 --> 00:24:30.760
and this is also a
physical discomfort.

00:24:31.820 --> 00:24:36.770
Imagine a fatigue that
is so intense that it’s

00:24:36.770 --> 00:24:40.370
as if gravity itself
is pulling you down,

00:24:40.370 --> 00:24:46.020
and also making every step and every
thought as a monumental effort.

00:24:46.020 --> 00:24:52.630
For instance, when I had a
flare-up, I even couldn't work

00:24:52.630 --> 00:24:56.760
from the bath to the bathroom
without excruciating pain.

00:24:56.760 --> 00:25:04.750
And it was really difficult to
accommodate my daily existence,

00:25:04.750 --> 00:25:05.520
for instance.

00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:11.740
I'm really glad I'm doing better
now, but it's really hard

00:25:11.740 --> 00:25:16.040
to accommodate those,
and imagine that translating

00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:24.040
to a WordCamp attendance,
or a Meetup attendance in person,

00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:28.780
but also attending to a virtual
event like the WP Accessibility Day,

00:25:28.780 --> 00:25:34.540
which is 24 hours a day,
and you want to learn a lot,

00:25:34.540 --> 00:25:37.940
but you can't sit for a long
time with this condition.

00:25:38.980 --> 00:25:43.190
The same spectrum also
fits in the Long COVID.

00:25:44.350 --> 00:25:52.350
It is also known like a neurologic
effect similar to MECFS,

00:25:54.700 --> 00:26:02.400
where they also have symptoms
persisting for weeks or even months.

00:26:03.650 --> 00:26:07.633
It’s like a ghost of an illness.

00:26:11.410 --> 00:26:14.743
When you're walking
alongside a person

00:26:14.744 --> 00:26:17.820
and you can't see it on their face.

00:26:19.340 --> 00:26:25.320
The same goes also for complex
post-traumatic stress disorder.

00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:33.060
For instance, someone who has
faced several traumatic events.

00:26:35.470 --> 00:26:40.560
That can also lead to
certain chronic diseases,

00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:45.990
and affect the mental health,
and your emotional regulation,

00:26:45.990 --> 00:26:47.430
but also relationships.

00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:55.180
The same goes also for ADHD,
known as attention deficit

00:26:55.180 --> 00:26:57.070
hyperactivity disorder.

00:26:57.070 --> 00:27:04.730
And ADHD is previously more
known from boys or young boys.

00:27:04.730 --> 00:27:12.730
But recent research shows that
also women have a form of ADHD,

00:27:13.890 --> 00:27:20.270
where the hyperactivity part is
more related in the thought process.

00:27:20.270 --> 00:27:21.920
And it's overwhelming.

00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:27.340
You have to think about every
step you do to fulfill a task.

00:27:27.340 --> 00:27:35.340
And it also is a whirlwind
of thoughts, ideas, impulses,

00:27:35.350 --> 00:27:38.130
but also you get easily distracted.

00:27:38.130 --> 00:27:46.130
So when someone enters a room,
you're seeing it in your periphery,

00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:52.060
or you're hearing some
noises, or a dog is barking

00:27:52.060 --> 00:27:55.350
and you're already distracted.

00:27:56.430 --> 00:28:03.650
And it can have a toll on your
cognitive ability to understand

00:28:03.650 --> 00:28:06.010
what someone is just telling.

00:28:08.930 --> 00:28:12.930
Lastly, I just also want to
include the autism spectrum.

00:28:14.310 --> 00:28:19.795
There's sensory experiences
like social interaction

00:28:19.796 --> 00:28:23.199
that can be complex.

00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:26.832
And this also are health challenges

00:28:26.833 --> 00:28:29.380
where someone doesn't
have the ability

00:28:29.380 --> 00:28:37.030
to understand social cues,
or sarcasm, or a twink with the eye

00:28:37.030 --> 00:28:38.130
or something like that.

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:45.220
Also the receptivity or
behavior someone may have needs

00:28:45.220 --> 00:28:50.870
to have a clear structure, where
they can go, what they can achieve.

00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:57.140
Each of these conditions,
even if they are invisible

00:28:57.140 --> 00:29:01.740
to the broader
audience, they are real.

00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:06.390
And those conditions shape
the lives and the experiences

00:29:06.390 --> 00:29:11.140
and contributions of many
in our WordPress community.

00:29:11.140 --> 00:29:16.010
I'm an advocate for inclusivity.

00:29:16.010 --> 00:29:19.850
And I’d like you to remember
that every step we take

00:29:19.850 --> 00:29:24.030
to accommodate and understand,
and support individuals

00:29:24.030 --> 00:29:29.320
with invisible health conditions is
a step toward a WordPress community

00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:35.970
that is truly diverse, inclusive, and
also makes someone feel belonging,

00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:44.510
and offers equitable ways to enter
the community and stay active

00:29:44.510 --> 00:29:45.510
in the community.

00:29:48.050 --> 00:29:53.030
From the perspective of
a WordCamp organizer,

00:29:53.030 --> 00:29:58.400
while I'm currently
organizing WordCamp Germany,

00:29:58.401 --> 00:30:03.833
the first time as an...

00:30:03.833 --> 00:30:06.400
I'm sorry, I switched slides.

00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:22.280
I'd like to tell a bit
about me in this moment.

00:30:25.250 --> 00:30:31.430
It's more about the invisible
illness and chronic disabilities.

00:30:31.430 --> 00:30:36.500
They are abstract terms,
but they are also lift experiences.

00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:44.260
You see the tangible impacts
on the outcome of someone.

00:30:44.260 --> 00:30:48.870
On the screen, you see a photo
of me captured during a talk

00:30:48.870 --> 00:30:53.400
at the WordCamp Utrecht in 2018.

00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:59.900
And this moment captures me as a
speaker, but also as a storyteller,

00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:05.266
talking about my
triumphs, my challenges,

00:31:05.267 --> 00:31:07.770
and also the silent battles.

00:31:08.767 --> 00:31:15.770
In the picture, I'm holding an
assistive gear I use to pull socks

00:31:16.140 --> 00:31:17.140
onto my feet.

00:31:18.130 --> 00:31:23.110
It's just a simple tool,
but it symbolizes, for me,

00:31:23.110 --> 00:31:28.450
the profound journey of
acceptance and adaptation.

00:31:28.450 --> 00:31:34.120
As an introduction,
it was mentioned I already have

00:31:34.120 --> 00:31:36.770
two total hip replacements.

00:31:36.770 --> 00:31:42.520
But back in the day, while standing
on that stage during the WordCamp

00:31:42.520 --> 00:31:47.460
in Utrecht, I had a really
heavy pain in both hips,

00:31:48.750 --> 00:31:55.490
and it was really difficult for
me just to do a mundane task

00:31:55.490 --> 00:31:57.030
like pulling up socks.

00:31:58.790 --> 00:32:06.790
I was thinking about,
I don't have any disabilities,

00:32:10.100 --> 00:32:14.020
but I needed some assistive gear.

00:32:14.020 --> 00:32:21.150
And it took me a long time to accept
the fact that I need assistive gear.

00:32:22.550 --> 00:32:29.850
But when I learned with this
gear, it was so helpful for me

00:32:29.850 --> 00:32:31.510
to go through my day.

00:32:33.100 --> 00:32:39.720
That day, I was kind of thinking
about, why didn't I use it more

00:32:41.930 --> 00:32:47.270
even earlier to make my
life even better and easier.

00:32:47.270 --> 00:32:55.270
And it's really interesting
to see how someone ignores

00:32:57.450 --> 00:32:59.490
that there is assistive gear.

00:33:00.860 --> 00:33:07.440
But also learns, in a hard way,
that using something is more easier.

00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:12.850
For instance,
when I travel to WordCamps, I order,

00:33:12.850 --> 00:33:17.670
when I travel by plane,
the accessibility service.

00:33:18.780 --> 00:33:26.780
I get wheelchaired or by a
Caddy car to the security check,

00:33:31.370 --> 00:33:34.330
passport control,
and even to the gate.

00:33:34.330 --> 00:33:38.410
Because walking long distances
for me is still a challenge,

00:33:38.410 --> 00:33:42.440
and I need to take a
break every 50 meters,

00:33:43.800 --> 00:33:49.540
because my pulse is pumping up
and I don't get enough breath

00:33:49.540 --> 00:33:51.420
and oxygen.

00:33:51.420 --> 00:33:54.550
So it's pretty difficult for me
along walking long distances.

00:33:55.860 --> 00:34:01.700
Also, I'd like to investigate
on the next slides

00:34:01.700 --> 00:34:07.500
for thriving press event organizers
that there are difficulties,

00:34:08.580 --> 00:34:12.120
and how we can manage those
and accommodate those.

00:34:14.930 --> 00:34:19.550
We navigate through the diverse
landscape of invisible illness

00:34:19.550 --> 00:34:22.000
and common challenges.

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:26.110
For instance, the difficulty,
fatigue, and energy management,

00:34:26.110 --> 00:34:31.100
as I recently told,
I need to take some breaks

00:34:31.100 --> 00:34:32.800
from chronic fatigue syndrome.

00:34:35.490 --> 00:34:41.060
When I'm attending an
event like a virtual event,

00:34:41.060 --> 00:34:45.090
it's really interesting
that we can accommodate this

00:34:45.090 --> 00:34:48.717
by offering flexible
participation options,

00:34:48.718 --> 00:34:51.190
like the WP Accessibility Day

00:34:51.190 --> 00:34:56.730
for instance, where the
sessions are getting recorded,

00:34:56.730 --> 00:35:07.867
and how long it takes to process
all those videos from 24 hours,

00:35:07.867 --> 00:35:12.620
they are offered as videos
you can re-watch, and watch

00:35:12.620 --> 00:35:16.150
in your own pace,
and pause in between.

00:35:18.100 --> 00:35:21.130
And there are also
breaks scheduled.

00:35:21.130 --> 00:35:25.390
The same goes for in person events.

00:35:25.390 --> 00:35:32.450
You can offer quiet and comfortable
spaces for attendees to rest,

00:35:32.450 --> 00:35:38.110
and make sure that you can
have some seating positions,

00:35:38.110 --> 00:35:42.134
like a chair or a
bench in the hallways,

00:35:42.135 --> 00:35:44.980
that people like me who need

00:35:44.980 --> 00:35:52.510
to take some breaks for long walking
distances can take the break,

00:35:52.510 --> 00:35:57.080
and don't look for any
ways to sit on a floor.

00:35:57.080 --> 00:36:02.420
Because when I sit on a
floor, I can't get back up.

00:36:02.420 --> 00:36:08.120
And also have a flexible schedule
so that you have a mix of short

00:36:08.120 --> 00:36:10.390
and longer sessions with breaks.

00:36:12.060 --> 00:36:14.640
The same goes for the
cognitive overload.

00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:23.960
Like for virtual meetups, settings
are important to provide a clear

00:36:23.960 --> 00:36:26.920
and concise agenda ahead of time.

00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:33.250
And also give visual aids,
and some infographics

00:36:33.250 --> 00:36:37.690
to simplify the complex
topics, for instance.

00:36:37.690 --> 00:36:43.770
And keep the content of
slides as short as possible,

00:36:43.770 --> 00:36:50.770
and use a good hierarchy
so that someone can grasp

00:36:50.770 --> 00:36:53.800
the content much easier.

00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:58.290
For the in-person event,
accommodation is the same.

00:36:58.290 --> 00:37:02.420
Like the quiet areas,
there’s also quiet rooms

00:37:02.420 --> 00:37:08.380
where attendees can take a
break from sensory overloads,

00:37:08.380 --> 00:37:15.890
and also provide different form of
materials or summaries for sessions.

00:37:15.890 --> 00:37:23.890
It is quite an organizational burden
sometimes to accommodate such thing,

00:37:25.050 --> 00:37:29.000
but in the end,
everyone benefits from this.

00:37:31.720 --> 00:37:35.280
The same goes with social anxiety.

00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:42.160
The pandemic was also
playing a big part,

00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:50.160
and some people have learned
that they don't do well in groups

00:37:50.530 --> 00:37:56.580
of people, and they may
not all have a disorder,

00:37:56.580 --> 00:37:59.510
but sometimes a spectrum of this.

00:37:59.510 --> 00:38:10.033
And we can, as organizers, ensure
that we allow participation via chat

00:38:10.033 --> 00:38:11.710
instead of a video.

00:38:11.710 --> 00:38:16.270
Or that we allow
anonymous participation,

00:38:16.270 --> 00:38:21.080
where they can use pseudonyms
or remain anonymous.

00:38:21.080 --> 00:38:27.940
Also, with in-person events,
we can create introvert zones

00:38:27.940 --> 00:38:30.550
with less sensory overload.

00:38:30.550 --> 00:38:35.504
And we designate areas
where attendees can network

00:38:35.505 --> 00:38:42.340
in smaller groups, and also
maybe offering body assistant.

00:38:42.340 --> 00:38:50.340
If you can imagine having a
volunteer group who offers assistance

00:38:50.850 --> 00:38:54.240
as a body so that we
can pair the attendees

00:38:54.240 --> 00:38:57.510
to help them navigate the event.

00:38:57.510 --> 00:39:05.510
It's not only for attendees,
like having visible disabilities,

00:39:09.230 --> 00:39:13.070
but also invisible disabilities.

00:39:17.967 --> 00:39:21.660
The same goes for
dietary restrictions.

00:39:24.680 --> 00:39:32.170
I see we are running low on time
so I’ll skip through some slides.

00:39:32.170 --> 00:39:37.790
I will provide the slides
after the talk, and feel free

00:39:37.790 --> 00:39:45.790
to read the tips in your own time.

00:39:48.620 --> 00:39:53.770
There are difficulties also for
medical treatment management.

00:39:55.860 --> 00:40:01.060
When we are creating inclusive
and accessible WordPress events,

00:40:01.060 --> 00:40:06.650
we have some practical strategies,
like the planning phase,

00:40:06.650 --> 00:40:07.760
and communication.

00:40:10.900 --> 00:40:15.240
And we need to have some
kind of survey feedback

00:40:15.240 --> 00:40:20.840
so that we have a diverse planning
committee for when you're selecting,

00:40:20.840 --> 00:40:22.300
et cetera.

00:40:22.300 --> 00:40:29.310
And also tips for attendees to
be patient and understanding,

00:40:29.310 --> 00:40:33.700
and ask before you're offering
help, and educate yourself

00:40:33.700 --> 00:40:36.110
about invisible disabilities.

00:40:40.610 --> 00:40:45.570
As we near the end of our
presentation, I'd like to invite you

00:40:45.570 --> 00:40:52.460
to have a visual and auditory
spectacle, like an orchestra.

00:40:52.460 --> 00:40:56.520
Imagine with me, if you will,
an orchestra where each musician,

00:40:56.520 --> 00:41:00.320
whether you can see them or
not, is holding an instrument.

00:41:00.320 --> 00:41:05.630
And a silent, yet profound,
is tantamount to their unique skills

00:41:05.630 --> 00:41:06.650
and experiences.

00:41:08.940 --> 00:41:12.040
This orchestra, with every
pause, and every note,

00:41:12.040 --> 00:41:15.690
and every crescendo is a
dance of a diverse experience,

00:41:15.690 --> 00:41:18.290
and a melody of silent battles.

00:41:18.290 --> 00:41:26.290
And someone who can't hear sound,
maybe also feels the rhythm

00:41:28.350 --> 00:41:29.990
in their body.

00:41:29.990 --> 00:41:33.440
So think of the WordPress
community as an orchestra.

00:41:33.440 --> 00:41:38.410
Each member, whether the
challenges are visible or not,

00:41:38.410 --> 00:41:39.590
plays a vital role.

00:41:39.590 --> 00:41:43.100
And we need to recognize
and accommodate each member.

00:41:44.130 --> 00:41:48.280
So it is the key to the
harmonious performance.

00:41:49.760 --> 00:41:57.760
Because when we embrace
inclusivity, every voice is heard,

00:42:00.350 --> 00:42:06.930
then we experience our value,
and we also feel like belong

00:42:07.940 --> 00:42:10.800
and are accepted.

00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:17.440
Accessibility benefits everyone
because it's not just a feature,

00:42:17.440 --> 00:42:25.440
but also a commitment,
and we have a diverse group

00:42:25.910 --> 00:42:32.210
when we invite everyone to
be accessible on our events.

00:42:32.210 --> 00:42:38.510
The picture shown on this slide
is taken by Sushitota [phonetic]

00:42:38.510 --> 00:42:43.290
during the WordPress Contributor
Day at the WordCamp US this year.

00:42:43.290 --> 00:42:48.490
I was participating, and it
shows a diverse group of people

00:42:48.490 --> 00:42:53.930
with big smiles on their faces and
they raise their hands of enjoyment.

00:42:53.930 --> 00:43:00.410
And it was a really accessible
event, but also displays that

00:43:02.450 --> 00:43:09.140
when we foster good connection,
that everyone is really interested

00:43:09.140 --> 00:43:17.309
in participating in event
like WP Accessibility Day

00:43:17.310 --> 00:43:19.688
or also any WordCamp.

00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:27.070
So this echoes our
today's information.

00:43:27.070 --> 00:43:34.480
I apologize that I struggled a
bit with the timing, but I want

00:43:34.480 --> 00:43:39.160
to extend my heartfelt gratitude
to all of your presence

00:43:39.160 --> 00:43:40.160
and your engagement.

00:43:41.740 --> 00:43:46.460
The photo on the left hand side
on the slide, shows me captured

00:43:46.460 --> 00:43:51.630
in a moment of joy when one
of my daughters got married,

00:43:51.630 --> 00:43:56.740
and it serves also as a reminder
to continue this conversation.

00:43:59.460 --> 00:44:00.950
I'm accessible.

00:44:00.950 --> 00:44:06.710
You can connect me and find me
on social sites at CoachBirgit,

00:44:06.710 --> 00:44:12.220
or on my website, CoachBirgit.com.
I’d like to invite you

00:44:12.220 --> 00:44:19.060
that we can together create events
that everyone feels welcomed.

00:44:20.880 --> 00:44:26.940
Like the common saying goes,
We came for the software,

00:44:26.940 --> 00:44:28.380
but we stayed for the people.

00:44:32.110 --> 00:44:36.030
 SAMYUKTHA: Thank you, Birgit,
for sharing the great information

00:44:36.030 --> 00:44:37.610
which is an eye-opener.

00:44:37.610 --> 00:44:42.320
And we have also gained a deeper
understanding of this topic.

00:44:42.320 --> 00:44:47.200
We really appreciate your time
for sharing your great insights.

00:44:47.200 --> 00:44:48.480
We have a couple of
questions for you.

00:44:48.480 --> 00:44:49.180
 BIRGIT: Yes.

00:44:50.733 --> 00:44:51.730
 SAMYUKTHA: Yes.

00:44:51.730 --> 00:44:55.900
Since invisible disabilities are
not evident, how can we prepare

00:44:55.900 --> 00:44:56.750
to address them?

00:44:56.750 --> 00:44:59.500
And how do we know we
are doing a good job?

00:45:00.900 --> 00:45:02.590
 BIRGIT: Thank you
for this great question.

00:45:03.660 --> 00:45:09.220
As I already mentioned,
there are ways to maybe survey,

00:45:10.410 --> 00:45:16.490
and pre-event organization
about kinds of disabilities.

00:45:16.490 --> 00:45:23.120
We need to be aware of the anonymity,
but also maybe privacy, GDPR.

00:45:23.120 --> 00:45:26.630
It is a sensitive topic to ask for.

00:45:26.630 --> 00:45:33.510
Not everyone is open to share
this, which is absolutely fine.

00:45:33.510 --> 00:45:40.220
But we are currently on
the WordPress Ecosystem

00:45:40.220 --> 00:45:44.780
and the DIB working group,
and we are currently working

00:45:44.780 --> 00:45:52.780
on facilitating a survey or offering
a survey to better understand

00:45:53.530 --> 00:45:57.480
how we can accommodate the
invisible disabilities.

00:45:59.130 --> 00:46:00.540
 SAMYUKTHA: That’s nice to know.

00:46:01.810 --> 00:46:08.210
Next question was from an Anonymous
attendee: You mentioned Long COVID,

00:46:08.210 --> 00:46:12.060
and I noticed the US
Center for Disease Control

00:46:12.060 --> 00:46:16.170
has increased the percentage
of people who have disabilities

00:46:16.170 --> 00:46:22.360
from 25% in 2019 to 27% now.

00:46:22.360 --> 00:46:25.090
Do you think that might
be due to Long COVID,

00:46:25.090 --> 00:46:27.870
or is there another explanation?

00:46:29.600 --> 00:46:31.490
 BIRGIT: Thank you
for this question.

00:46:31.490 --> 00:46:35.117
I'm not a research expert in that,

00:46:35.118 --> 00:46:39.490
but I can just tell
from my perception.

00:46:39.800 --> 00:46:44.860
I think Long COVID
puts a lot into this.

00:46:47.310 --> 00:46:55.310
Any viral infection gives
internal stress, and COVID,

00:46:55.350 --> 00:46:58.810
as a virus infection,
is also tailoring to this.

00:47:00.190 --> 00:47:04.080
I saw a lot of people
mentioning that also Long COVID

00:47:04.080 --> 00:47:09.920
is raising the disability numbers.

00:47:09.920 --> 00:47:15.600
And I think it contributes to
this number, Long COVID, Yes.

00:47:15.840 --> 00:47:21.290
 SAMYUKTHA: That's
nice to hear from you.

00:47:21.290 --> 00:47:22.500
Thank you for your time.

00:47:24.380 --> 00:47:26.630
We really appreciate you.

00:47:26.630 --> 00:47:29.510
Thank you, everyone, for
attending the session with Birgit.

00:47:29.510 --> 00:47:32.250
You can continue the
conversation in the chat

00:47:32.250 --> 00:47:40.160
or on social media using
#WPA11YDAY and #WPAD2023.

00:47:40.160 --> 00:47:46.070
We also appreciate if you go to
2023.wpaccessibility.day/feedback

00:47:46.070 --> 00:47:52.840
to provide anonymous feedback to
our speakers on their presentation,

00:47:52.840 --> 00:47:59.733
and can enter for a
chance to win a T-shirt.

00:48:00.040 --> 00:48:04.760
Stay tuned for the great
next talk: Simple Ways

00:48:04.760 --> 00:48:10.950
to Make Your Email Accessible,
with Gerson Lacdao at 08:00 UTC.

00:48:10.950 --> 00:48:14.620
Don't forget to visit our sponsors’
page to get virtual swags.

00:48:14.620 --> 00:48:16.480
See you right after the break.

00:48:17.733 --> 00:48:22.340
 AMBER: Thank you to WordPress
Accessibility Day 2023 sponsors.

00:48:22.340 --> 00:48:25.200
Platinum Sponsor: Equalize Digital.

00:48:25.200 --> 00:48:27.950
Equalize Digital’s
Accessibility Checker Plugin

00:48:27.950 --> 00:48:30.680
is an automated
accessibility-scanning tool

00:48:30.680 --> 00:48:33.890
