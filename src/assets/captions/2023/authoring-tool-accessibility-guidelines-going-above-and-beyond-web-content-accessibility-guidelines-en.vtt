00:00:01.008 --> 00:00:04.600
<v Amber Hinds> WordPress
Accessibility Day 2023:

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:07.170
Authoring Tool
Accessibility Guidelines -

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.770
Going Above and Beyond Web
Content Accessibility Guidelines,

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:13.620
with Speaker Helen Burge.

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.620
Director, Digital
Accessibility, Testlio.

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:21.830
This presentation was
recorded September 28th, 2023.

00:00:23.151 --> 00:00:24.310
<v Joost de Valk> Hey, hello.

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:26.070
And hello everyone.

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.070
Welcome to WordPress
Accessibility Day 2023.

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.690
Again, probably for most of you...
but I'm new.

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:34.150
So my name is Joost de Valk.

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:36.000
I'm a partner at Emilia Capital.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.650
I'm the CTO of Post Status
among many other things.

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:42.550
But much more importantly, I'm the
MC for you for the next few hours.

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:49.870
I'm really delighted to introduce
our next speaker, Helen Burge,

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:54.130
who will talk to us about authoring
tool accessibility guidelines.

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:57.700
Helen currently holds the position
of Director of Digital Accessibility

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.570
at Testlio,
and she has a distinguished career

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.310
since completing her University
studies at Bournemouth University.

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:09.120
She specializes in
focusing on accessibility,

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:13.500
and she has tirelessly advocated
for enhanced user experiences.

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.170
She has collaborated
closely with developers.

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.560
I'm a developer myself,
so I really appreciate that,

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.970
when people actually do collaborate
with developers to identify

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:26.040
and address accessibility issues,
establishing best practices

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.210
along the way.

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.700
Helen has worked with multiple
companies, ranging from Deque,

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.150
AbilityNet, Tenen, just to name
a few, leaving a lasting impact

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.340
with her expertise in
digital accessibility.

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.170
Committed to lifelong learning,
she continues to refine her skills

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:43.310
and knowledge.

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.800
Always aiming to ensure an optimal
experience for every user regardless

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.090
of their background.

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.240
Please join me in extending a
warm welcome to Helen Burge.

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:54.420
Take it away, Helen.

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:56.970
 <v Helen Burge> Thank you.

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:59.070
I hope I live up to
that introduction.

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:04.470
Thank you for coming.

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.240
This is a little bit
on the audit side

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.500
because we're talking
about guidelines.

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.370
And when it comes to
WordPress, there's a bit more

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.070
to just the web content
accessibility guidelines.

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:22.400
So I thought it would be
good to give you an overview

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.710
to authoring tool accessibility
guidelines or ATAG.

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.720
And as you can tell,
I do try to practice what I preach

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.760
with accessibility by having a full
term rather than an abbreviation,

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.370
because my title would
be a lot shorter then.

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:41.930
What I intend to cover today
is the history, the audience,

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:48.340
as in who requires ATAG,
where to start, a quick checklist

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:55.810
of what you can use when checking
what plugins you're going

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:02.400
to use with your WordPress
website or other tools as it were.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.430
And then I'm going to go
through part A, what's covered

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:11.600
in part A of ATAG, and I do cover
that a bit more through the slides,

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:15.500
part B, and then a summary.

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:21.100
So I'm trying not to give too
much away because I cover most

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:23.740
of what this all
means as I go through.

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:29.520
So for the history,
we had ATAG published

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:36.240
in 2015 after WCAG 2 was released.

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:44.240
And it goes side by side as
part of the Web Accessibility

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:48.340
Initiative Guidelines,
because we have three items.

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.440
We've got Web Content
Accessibility Guidelines,

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.660
We've got Authoring Tools
Accessibility Guidelines,

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:55.420
and User Agent
Accessibility Guidelines.

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:59.150
They all sort of
intertwine, and both ATAG,

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:03.990
and I say Ugg rather
than new UAAG sometimes,

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:08.710
but they both incorporate
WCAG as part of their testing.

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:12.660
They don't say we're all
independent and repeat stuff.

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:14.580
They reuse, and that's always
great, isn't it?

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:17.660
When we reuse each other's items.

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:19.720
But they have additional checks.

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:25.700
So authoring tools are things like
WordPress, where it's allowing you

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:27.670
to create something
that you put online.

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.710
Other tools can we
say, a word processor.

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:35.610
I'm trying not to name any
companies when I say this,

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:45.210
or sometimes more complicated tools
that you use to produce a website.

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:48.930
And again, I'm trying not to mention
Dreamweaver because we all know

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:52.880
that sometimes the tools don't
always make a good website

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:55.550
if the author doesn't totally
understand what they're doing.

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:57.013
And that's why Authoring Tools

00:04:57.014 --> 00:04:59.110
Accessibility Guidelines
were introduced,

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:02.140
to help you choose the tools
that will help you create

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:03.140
something accessible.

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:06.310
And user agent
accessibility guidelines,

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:11.020
that refers to things like browsers,
and what renders the content.

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:13.170
We're not going to cover that
too much today, but I want you

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:15.090
to understand there's
something out there.

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:20.150
Some say it's no longer needed
because when we get to WCAG3

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:25.470
and yes, the WC is staying in,
but it's going to be the W3C

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:28.330
for the acronym rather than
web content because AG is going

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:34.660
to be accessibility guidelines
for all of these items.

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:36.560
Anyway, that's still in the future.

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:43.270
So for now, we have three different
sets that are relevant according

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:46.150
to what it is you're using.

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:52.190
And yes,
I did copy an image from the W3C,

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:55.850
which is why I have credited it so
that you know where I got it from.

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:04.680
Anyway, the audience for ATAG.

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:09.360
If you can't make your
website accessible,

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:12.740
it can mean you exclude a lot
of your potential audience.

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:15.530
Never assume the needs of the
audience when building a website.

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:21.190
So the audience of ATAG is designed
for users that create content

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:23.130
for the web.

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:26.240
And I do hope a lot of you
are aware of these already,

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:28.610
but if not,
then this is a great starting point.

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:35.150
And as I said already, it's used
with WCAG if it's web-based.

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:39.960
If you've got something that is
an application that doesn't need

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:44.020
to go online,
then WCAG is not relevant.

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:48.420
But you still have to make
sure that's accessible to you.

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:50.130
And it's split into two parts.

00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:53.680
Part A: is the tool
itself accessible?

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:57.220
If I'm using, say, a screen
reader, do I understand the parts

00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:01.750
of the tool like,
is that button labeled as a button?

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:07.430
Part B: that's more relevant
to this tool in the fact that

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:11.350
when you're choosing the tool, does
it let you create accessible content?

00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:17.320
And the reason why these are both
important is because you want

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:21.480
to use plugins that don't block you
from making your content accessible.

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:27.420
If you've got something that doesn't
let you put alt tags onto images,

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:28.910
how's that going to
make your life easier?

00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:32.290
Are you going to add a caption
underneath it in the hope that

00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:33.740
that will be used?

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:38.320
Or is it going to use AI and
auto-generate alternative text

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:40.470
that will mean nothing to the user?

00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:44.930
So it's really important to make
sure that if you're choosing a plugin

00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:51.660
to build your site, that you are
going to be allowed to be the author

00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:54.690
of the content and don't let someone
else make the decisions for you.

00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:59.210
Because as we all know,
when it comes to accessibility,

00:07:59.210 --> 00:08:06.240
there's no one size fits all
and we all have like moments...

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:08.160
I always call it moments
because I have a lot of them.

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:12.130
I haven't had enough coffee today,
haven't had enough sleep today,

00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:16.780
they kind of go hand in hand really,
or I'm not wearing my glasses,

00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:23.750
or my toddler is pulling at my
arm so I can't type with one hand.

00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:27.540
There's all moments where I need
content to be more accessible,

00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:31.640
so this is why as we all know
it's important we make sure

00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:36.050
what we make is going to
make sure no one's blocked

00:08:36.050 --> 00:08:37.060
by what we deliver.

00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:39.830
So where to start?

00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:41.613
I found this image and I was like,

00:08:41.614 --> 00:08:43.710
that was me trying
to write this talk.

00:08:45.304 --> 00:08:49.010
So I was doing some
research for this talk

00:08:49.010 --> 00:08:55.710
about WordPress accessibility
plugins, and I'll share a bit

00:08:55.710 --> 00:09:00.680
of my findings after
this but when we start,

00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:02.240
do you author the content?

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:06.630
If you don't, then ATAG might
not be as relevant to you.

00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:14.900
But do you author content,
or do you have a WordPress site

00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:17.200
that you get content
authored for you?

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:19.790
That's also something
to be aware of.

00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:24.755
Make sure that whatever
plugins you're using are going

00:09:24.756 --> 00:09:26.560
to be meeting ATAG.

00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:29.150
Oh, yes.

00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:30.890
Are you in charge of
selecting the plugins?

00:09:30.890 --> 00:09:31.910
That's always important.

00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:34.830
If not, you can always
highlight to the person that is

00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:40.690
in charge of selecting the
plugins any findings you have,

00:09:40.690 --> 00:09:42.120
with the ones that you use.

00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:47.370
And do you test them to check if they
allow you to add accessible content?

00:09:47.370 --> 00:09:50.890
I've already mentioned the most
obvious one, alternative text.

00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:58.710
But there's other ones too, like
link text, or adding descriptions,

00:09:58.710 --> 00:10:01.350
or hints to items that
might not be intuitive.

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:05.070
There's so many variations.

00:10:05.070 --> 00:10:06.530
And do they guide you?

00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:12.310
Do they tell you they've
done the work for you?

00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:16.120
Or do they highlight what
might need fixing and help you?

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:18.740
And do you believe the ones that
claim they do the work for you?

00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:23.140
Because I'm going to share
with you now this website.

00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:26.350
When I was looking into
this, I was looking

00:10:26.350 --> 00:10:33.020
into WordPress accessibility
plugins, and I went through the site.

00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:33.590
I was very excited.

00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:35.760
I was like, oh,
there's like lots of articles.

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:37.430
And I went through this.

00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:41.750
And I started to go through,
and I started noticing the authors

00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:47.840
that use the way, Accessor B,
there's a lot of plugins that claim

00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:49.220
to do the work for you.

00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:57.220
What they're doing is... Yes,
this article annoyed me quite a bit

00:10:58.660 --> 00:11:04.140
because they're like, oh, I've got
a plug in here and it will fix it

00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:05.230
for you.

00:11:05.230 --> 00:11:09.030
And they don't actually
help you make the choices

00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:14.380
of what changes are made.

00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:16.050
It just overlays it.

00:11:16.050 --> 00:11:20.390
And we all know accessibility
overlays are snake oil.

00:11:20.390 --> 00:11:23.280
They promise to fix things,
but they don't actually

00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:25.280
and they can be
frustrating to users.

00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:28.210
I was looking at a
website the other day.

00:11:28.210 --> 00:11:36.210
I was ordering some bits for my
son who has autism, some light toys

00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:39.070
because he's fascinated by lights.

00:11:39.070 --> 00:11:41.510
And they had an accessibility
plug-in over the top of it

00:11:41.510 --> 00:11:44.390
and it was on my mobile,
and it was blocking my view for part

00:11:44.390 --> 00:11:47.060
of the site because it just wouldn't
go, you couldn't dismiss it.

00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:49.980
And I was like, how's that
actually making my life easier?

00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:52.210
I don't need it.

00:11:52.210 --> 00:11:54.100
I don't want it.

00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:54.730
Go away.

00:11:54.730 --> 00:11:55.640
And I did email them.

00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:56.730
I didn't get a response.

00:11:56.730 --> 00:11:59.870
Just saying, please take it
away, it's not going to work.

00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:04.420
So yes, it does look like,
even though the article

00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:09.310
does recommend Joe Dolsen's plug-in,
that actually looks at the things

00:12:09.310 --> 00:12:12.270
and fixes them to make them
accessible when you start,

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:15.040
be careful what they promise.

00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:19.980
If they do the hard work for
you, you might end up

00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:25.160
with something that is going to
frustrate and annoy your audience.

00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:30.310
So when it comes to choosing
plugins, go for reputable ones

00:12:30.310 --> 00:12:34.770
and also make sure that they
allow you to make changes,

00:12:34.770 --> 00:12:37.660
that they don't take
the control from you.

00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:42.950
And I think you've shared the
links, haven't you?

00:12:42.950 --> 00:12:49.110
So there's also a lovely overlay
fact sheet that Karl Groves wrote

00:12:49.110 --> 00:12:50.930
and collaborated on.

00:12:50.930 --> 00:12:54.760
And I have signed that,
I think a lot of us probably have.

00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:56.840
I recommend if you
haven't, to sign it.

00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:59.870
Because the overlays are just...
Anyway,

00:12:59.870 --> 00:13:02.370
that was my little soapbox
moment, I apologize there.

00:13:03.390 --> 00:13:06.310
And yes,
that was my frustration there,

00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:13.010
this person's showing their hands
on the head looking at their screen

00:13:13.010 --> 00:13:15.930
when I was looking into these
plugins and finding this article.

00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:25.060
So when it comes to Part B,
which is when you're trying

00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:30.730
to choose the plugin that's right
for you, there's a quick checklist.

00:13:30.730 --> 00:13:32.340
So is there an
accessibility checker?

00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:36.050
I always use that,
I use it on my slides.

00:13:36.050 --> 00:13:39.010
And it's quite clever these
days because it will notice

00:13:39.010 --> 00:13:42.600
if an alternative text has been
generated, and it will say,

00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:43.600
are you sure you want this one?

00:13:44.660 --> 00:13:47.520
Which is good because sometimes
when you look at what is generated,

00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:49.000
it's nothing like the image itself.

00:13:50.170 --> 00:13:53.600
And oh yes, I forgot to say
there's an image of a laptop

00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:57.350
with a WordPress site on it.

00:13:57.350 --> 00:14:02.370
I was quite chuffed when I found
an image of a WordPress site.

00:14:02.370 --> 00:14:07.810
I did have a site once, but I
don't anymore so I apologize there.

00:14:08.950 --> 00:14:11.720
Anyway, so is there an accessibility
checker... Is there something

00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:19.720
that will check my content and flag
anything that maybe needs fixing,

00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:23.210
like color contrast
or is there something

00:14:23.210 --> 00:14:28.680
that doesn't have an alternative text
or... It's always nice to have one.

00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:30.590
If it doesn't have one,
it's not the end of the world

00:14:30.590 --> 00:14:32.770
but it's just good to have.

00:14:33.850 --> 00:14:35.780
What guidance is available?

00:14:35.780 --> 00:14:39.670
Like we all know WordPress is a
great community for accessibility.

00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:41.340
So there's a lot of
guidance out there.

00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:47.610
You can go to the Slack forum,
you can go to the forum itself

00:14:47.610 --> 00:14:51.170
and ask questions and you'll
get someone lovely helping you

00:14:51.170 --> 00:14:54.010
to fix any accessibility issues.

00:14:54.010 --> 00:14:57.250
So that's why I would
recommend WordPress.

00:14:57.250 --> 00:14:59.640
Not just because they
wanted me to speak,

00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:04.600
but because they actually are
advocating what they preach.

00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:07.010
So yes, what guidance is available?

00:15:08.550 --> 00:15:10.690
That also can just be a help file.

00:15:10.690 --> 00:15:13.690
Like if I want to know
how to do something,

00:15:13.690 --> 00:15:19.160
if I can't easily find the
answer, that's a no-no.

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:22.310
I want to know how
to do things myself,

00:15:22.310 --> 00:15:25.760
and if I can't find the answer
easily and it's not intuitive,

00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:26.910
it's something to avoid then.

00:15:28.390 --> 00:15:29.760
And yes, I keep mentioning it,

00:15:29.761 --> 00:15:31.770
can alternative text
be added to an image?

00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:38.630
I did have experience
with an authoring tool

00:15:38.630 --> 00:15:42.240
where it had a banner image,
and you were not allowed

00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:45.130
to add any alternative text .

00:15:45.130 --> 00:15:48.970
And people kept putting a lot
of meaningful images in there

00:15:48.970 --> 00:15:50.080
with no description.

00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:51.700
And I said the only
way to work around it,

00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:53.700
because I didn't have the
choice, I wasn't allowed

00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:56.010
to choose the plugins or
the tool that we were using.

00:15:57.550 --> 00:16:01.570
So what I was doing was
adding a caption to the image,

00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:04.510
because it was the only
thing I could think

00:16:04.510 --> 00:16:09.060
of that would give a text
alternative to the image.

00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:10.970
It was a hack, it wasn't pretty.

00:16:13.010 --> 00:16:18.480
And I do think when it
comes to these hacks,

00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:23.260
they're a well-meaning way around
things, but they shouldn't be needed.

00:16:27.570 --> 00:16:30.480
Our links start using
more than color and line.

00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:36.800
This is another one, that sometimes
a bold link is not enough for me.

00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:38.320
I prefer to have an underline.

00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:39.200
I'm old school.

00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:43.540
If I see a change of color and
an underline, I know it's a link.

00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:47.210
But bold text is a
slight differentiator.

00:16:47.210 --> 00:16:54.940
But yes, if they style the links
and you can't change the format

00:16:54.940 --> 00:16:58.260
to suit your preferences, you
have to make it easy for the users

00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:00.900
to understand,
that's another one to be aware of.

00:17:03.050 --> 00:17:05.760
Can the keyboard focus
all actionable items?

00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:06.360
Yes.

00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:10.590
Do they have div items where
they add in items for you?

00:17:10.590 --> 00:17:12.430
Again, going back to
the snake oil people.

00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:19.410
If they add in lots of divs or
nested divs... It can be done

00:17:19.410 --> 00:17:24.650
due to JavaScript being injected
in, like when using React kind

00:17:24.650 --> 00:17:29.450
of frameworks where embed
divs into links that means

00:17:29.450 --> 00:17:32.560
that the list items are no longer
recognised by the screen reader.

00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:37.520
But it can also make things
like buttons not be a button.

00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:39.130
The keyboard can't focus it.

00:17:40.190 --> 00:17:43.980
And also another
one to add to that.

00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:46.500
If it's focused,
can I see the focus?

00:17:48.250 --> 00:17:50.290
So is it focusable and
can I see the focus?

00:17:50.290 --> 00:17:51.760
That's a good one to be checking.

00:17:53.170 --> 00:17:57.930
And if you copy accessible content
in, like if you find an image

00:17:57.930 --> 00:18:01.600
with a brilliant alternative
text and I copy and paste it,

00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:04.150
does the alternative text get
moved over too, or do I have

00:18:04.150 --> 00:18:07.950
to copy and paste the alternative
text into my image after I've copied

00:18:07.950 --> 00:18:08.950
and pasted it?

00:18:10.390 --> 00:18:15.020
I know that sounds like
something that's a minor thing,

00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:19.150
but if you're doing large
amounts of content creation,

00:18:19.150 --> 00:18:23.750
that can be an RSI sort of a passive
strain injury sort of incident.

00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:29.900
So that is for your ease of
not having to do an extra step

00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:31.320
to get the accessibility embedded.

00:18:35.390 --> 00:18:43.390
So, part A. Part A of ATAG is about,
is the tool itself accessible to use?

00:18:44.850 --> 00:18:49.610
So this is important if as part
of your content creation team,

00:18:49.610 --> 00:18:52.720
you've got anyone that might
rely on assistive technology

00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:57.360
or use assistive technology
on a daily basis.

00:18:57.360 --> 00:19:02.440
So, I always judge it,
could I understand this

00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:04.390
if I haven't had my coffee?

00:19:04.390 --> 00:19:10.220
But for part A, we have A1,
the authoring tool user interface

00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:12.620
follows applicable
accessibility guidelines.

00:19:13.780 --> 00:19:19.360
In other words, if it's web
based, does it follow WCAG?

00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:22.810
Does it meet the WCAG
checkpoints, Yes or no?

00:19:22.810 --> 00:19:26.400
That one is the largest part
of an ATAG world, making sure

00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:28.490
that WCAG is covered.

00:19:28.490 --> 00:19:30.609
But it also applies...

00:19:30.610 --> 00:19:35.520
It has a section for non
web based functionality.

00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:40.360
So if you have an application,
it's a similar principle of WCAG,

00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:42.350
but it is a stand-alone
application.

00:19:43.890 --> 00:19:46.770
So it's not HTML based, basically.

00:19:46.770 --> 00:19:48.890
It's making sure buttons
announces buttons.

00:19:48.890 --> 00:19:50.990
When you fix them,
do they interact with the keyboard?

00:19:50.990 --> 00:19:51.990
Same sort of thing.

00:19:52.660 --> 00:19:56.040
If I'm using a tool,
can I use it using a screen reader?

00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:57.730
Can I use it with a keyboard alone?

00:19:57.730 --> 00:19:59.790
Can I zoom in?

00:19:59.790 --> 00:20:01.290
Can I change the colors?

00:20:01.290 --> 00:20:04.900
Are the colors easy to
see in the first place?

00:20:04.900 --> 00:20:06.910
Am I allowed to change?

00:20:06.910 --> 00:20:12.130
Those are all things that should be
part of checking if it's accessible.

00:20:13.870 --> 00:20:17.020
Then again, editing views,
are they perceivable?

00:20:17.020 --> 00:20:25.020
So if I'm editing content, am I able
to get into all the different items?

00:20:25.310 --> 00:20:28.200
Do I understand what
I'm putting in where?

00:20:30.370 --> 00:20:35.260
So you need to make sure that there
is alternative content available

00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:37.330
to authors as needed.

00:20:37.330 --> 00:20:40.130
For instance, if it's a drag and
drop, can the keyboard do it?

00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:44.340
And just needs to be
programmatically determined.

00:20:46.150 --> 00:20:48.200
And then are they operable?

00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:50.750
You've got Paul coming in here.

00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:52.510
So editing views,
are they operable?

00:20:52.510 --> 00:20:53.780
Can I use a keyboard?

00:20:53.780 --> 00:20:55.050
Do I have to use a mouse?

00:20:55.050 --> 00:21:01.460
Can I use another tool to edit
items in the editing view?

00:21:03.290 --> 00:21:04.730
And are they understandable?

00:21:04.730 --> 00:21:07.710
Again, is the language simple?

00:21:07.710 --> 00:21:13.920
And does it make sense with
the roles assigned and so on?

00:21:15.870 --> 00:21:17.510
Because they don't have robust.

00:21:17.510 --> 00:21:24.270
Because basically when it comes
to editing views, we have ATAG

00:21:24.270 --> 00:21:26.960
at a glance, which I think
is a very good starting point

00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:30.570
for anyone when it comes
to these guidelines.

00:21:30.570 --> 00:21:31.590
But we don't have robust.

00:21:31.590 --> 00:21:35.490
Because robust is for content
you are creating yourself.

00:21:35.490 --> 00:21:40.760
This is more about checking the
tool is doing as it needs to.

00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:44.630
And as we all know,
4.1.1 [Inaudible 21:42]

00:21:44.630 --> 00:21:47.060
is no longer tested.

00:21:47.060 --> 00:21:52.180
Well, no longer deemed worthwhile
to be tested, I should say.

00:21:54.730 --> 00:21:56.080
But still I'm excited.

00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:59.490
4.1.1 one was always
a bit of a long winded

00:21:59.490 --> 00:22:02.180
with very low severity
issues type of checkpoints.

00:22:02.180 --> 00:22:03.580
So anyway.

00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:07.020
But robust is not there
because these are things

00:22:07.020 --> 00:22:15.020
that are covered partly by
WCAG and the editing views.

00:22:15.340 --> 00:22:17.840
You're not checking that
they've been built correctly.

00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:22.040
You're just making sure that the
user has no issues with interacting

00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:23.040
with them.

00:22:25.390 --> 00:22:29.260
Anyway, part B. This is a
bit that's most important for

00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:33.130
when you choose a plugin;
making sure it supports you in

00:22:33.130 --> 00:22:35.480
being able to produce
accessible content.

00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:45.000
So we have part B of B1:
fully automatic process

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:46.830
produce accessible content.

00:22:46.830 --> 00:22:51.170
This is not doing the job for you
people, it's not the overlay thing,

00:22:51.170 --> 00:22:56.120
it's more about does it have a
wizard that identifies where you need

00:22:56.120 --> 00:22:57.340
to change things?

00:22:58.440 --> 00:23:02.900
Does it flag things going, Oh
my word, you can't publish this,

00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:05.140
you haven't added an alt tag.

00:23:05.140 --> 00:23:06.930
I'm not saying it should
have an alarm like that

00:23:06.930 --> 00:23:08.390
but it would be kind
of cool if it did,

00:23:08.390 --> 00:23:12.250
because I know I personally sometimes
forget or I get a bit rushed,

00:23:12.250 --> 00:23:16.310
and it would be really
nice if there was a warning

00:23:16.310 --> 00:23:18.600
that sometimes it
needs to be checked.

00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:24.240
I know that on Word it will
have a little icon at the bottom

00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:26.840
to let me know that there's
issues with the accessibility.

00:23:28.390 --> 00:23:36.390
So is there something that will
help do some of the grunt work,

00:23:38.250 --> 00:23:41.040
I call it, checking everything
for you to make sure that there...

00:23:42.310 --> 00:23:45.570
It doesn't do all the work
because it doesn't make sure that,

00:23:45.570 --> 00:23:48.170
say, the alternative
text is meaningful.

00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:53.680
It's more about checking, are the
programmatic items there, yes or no?

00:23:56.440 --> 00:24:02.050
And B2, to complement B1, as I said
before, it needs to have processes

00:24:02.050 --> 00:24:06.050
to help you produce content,
but B2s are author supported

00:24:06.050 --> 00:24:07.550
in making accessible content.

00:24:07.550 --> 00:24:10.710
It's not doing it for
you, it's supporting.

00:24:10.710 --> 00:24:13.690
So it's making sure that
it gives you guides.

00:24:13.690 --> 00:24:17.470
It will assist you with
templates that are accessible,

00:24:17.470 --> 00:24:21.460
and I know WordPress again,
has a lot of accessible contents

00:24:21.460 --> 00:24:23.790
and templates.

00:24:23.790 --> 00:24:26.020
Don't always believe it,
just because it says it is.

00:24:26.020 --> 00:24:30.390
I always recommend quickly checking
them out, because as we all know,

00:24:30.390 --> 00:24:35.900
I could say that I was German,
for instance, but with my accent,

00:24:35.900 --> 00:24:39.310
you might be like, I'm not sure
you're telling the truth Helen.

00:24:39.310 --> 00:24:41.440
So just because I say
something does make it true.

00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:44.330
So just because something says
it's accessible, doesn't mean it

00:24:44.330 --> 00:24:45.820
might be 100%.

00:24:45.820 --> 00:24:50.680
So yes, it's great that they produce
accessible content and templates,

00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:55.910
but also you need to make sure
that you can change templates

00:24:55.910 --> 00:24:59.240
to suit your needs and to suit
your audience's needs as needed.

00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:05.070
And also, will they help authors
with accessible pre-authored content?

00:25:06.340 --> 00:25:09.200
Again, that's helping
with making sure that

00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:13.940
if you are a little bit non
techy, some of this will seem

00:25:13.940 --> 00:25:16.610
a little bit much to start up with.

00:25:16.610 --> 00:25:20.400
So I recommend if you've got
a great support community

00:25:21.470 --> 00:25:24.490
that will help,
that makes a massive difference

00:25:24.490 --> 00:25:27.070
to helping create
accessible content.

00:25:27.070 --> 00:25:32.010
And yes, are authors supported
in improving accessibility.

00:25:32.010 --> 00:25:36.460
So again, it's a bit like
the wizard part of it again.

00:25:36.460 --> 00:25:40.760
When I say wizard, it's not the
paperclip, but pretty much like.

00:25:42.010 --> 00:25:46.480
And it's basically sometimes
when I'm not sure going

00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:50.270
through the accessibility options,
I might not be able to get

00:25:50.270 --> 00:25:52.600
to the reordering of content.

00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:55.380
Like on slides,
sometimes it goes forward,

00:25:55.380 --> 00:25:57.980
sometimes it goes backwards
with the readability.

00:25:57.980 --> 00:26:00.040
It all depends on what
my first slide did.

00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:06.270
And then I get an option to
click, to go to the reorder option

00:26:06.270 --> 00:26:09.350
because I find it easily
in the menu options.

00:26:09.350 --> 00:26:13.710
And it's nice that it gives you
that quick jump to the tool you need

00:26:13.710 --> 00:26:15.400
to be able to fix the items.

00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:17.860
So when I talk about a
wizard, it's something

00:26:17.860 --> 00:26:22.500
that does a few shortcuts for you for
what you obviously need help with.

00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:27.680
And I call them wizards
because it's a dark art

00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:32.490
sometimes reading my mind,
but it seems to manage quite well.

00:26:32.490 --> 00:26:34.500
So it must be magical.

00:26:34.500 --> 00:26:39.130
Anyway, so do they assist authors in
checking for accessibility problems?

00:26:39.130 --> 00:26:41.010
Again, an accessibility check.

00:26:42.380 --> 00:26:44.650
And do they help with the repairs?

00:26:47.220 --> 00:26:51.360
And do they promote and integrate
their accessibility features?

00:26:54.440 --> 00:26:56.290
In other words,
do you have to search for it?

00:26:56.290 --> 00:26:59.930
Do you have to really look for how
to do something, or does it try

00:26:59.930 --> 00:27:03.170
to do it for you and
then tell you it's done?

00:27:03.170 --> 00:27:10.880
I'm not trying to tell everyone
not to use certain tools at all,

00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:14.620
but you'll notice that there
is a hidden agenda to this talk

00:27:14.620 --> 00:27:17.400
because slightly [Inaudible 27:17].

00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:21.200
Anyway, make sure that the
authoring tools promote

00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:23.980
and integrate their accessibility
features, but they let you know

00:27:23.980 --> 00:27:28.360
what they're doing, and you
can change it if you need to.

00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:31.500
And again, I take a glance.

00:27:34.140 --> 00:27:37.550
So anyway, so when authoring content,
you need to make it accessible.

00:27:38.730 --> 00:27:39.860
That's a given.

00:27:39.860 --> 00:27:42.520
You've come to this day of
talks where you've had lots

00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:46.110
of people, passionate,
telling you lots of hints and tips,

00:27:46.110 --> 00:27:49.290
and me with my little soapbox
saying don't use the overlays

00:27:49.290 --> 00:27:50.290
because I'm naughty.

00:27:51.870 --> 00:27:54.730
But you need to make
sure it's accessible.

00:27:54.730 --> 00:27:55.440
It's on you.

00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:57.110
No one else can take that from you.

00:27:57.110 --> 00:28:01.690
You can have someone audit it and
tell you what to do, but it's you.

00:28:01.690 --> 00:28:03.690
You are the one
creating the content.

00:28:03.690 --> 00:28:08.860
So it's quite a big responsibility
because then you get less sarcasm

00:28:08.860 --> 00:28:12.550
from me, if I happen to know you.

00:28:12.550 --> 00:28:16.890
Anyway, ATAG helps, because it
helps you work out what to focus on.

00:28:16.890 --> 00:28:18.820
It's got some guidelines.

00:28:18.820 --> 00:28:22.720
Some can be slightly misinterpreted,
like with the automatic processes,

00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:27.140
but it does let you know
what you need to focus on.

00:28:27.140 --> 00:28:30.490
Can I make the
changes, am I helped?

00:28:30.490 --> 00:28:34.260
It's not about leaving you to try
and work out what to do on your own.

00:28:36.660 --> 00:28:40.548
And it's often best
used with this checklist

00:28:40.549 --> 00:28:44.170
before doing any WCAG testing
that's done on your website.

00:28:44.170 --> 00:28:47.810
Because if you are aware
of the of how to fix items

00:28:47.810 --> 00:28:51.810
and you have gone through it,
If you've done the ATAG part

00:28:51.810 --> 00:28:57.230
of making sure your plugins
let you change items, then

00:28:57.230 --> 00:29:01.950
when you come to do a check on
your website that you've authored,

00:29:01.950 --> 00:29:04.930
I'm assuming it's a website
that you document or whatever...

00:29:04.930 --> 00:29:07.740
But if you've done the ATAG
part, and made sure

00:29:07.740 --> 00:29:11.890
you've applied all these items
to the content you're offering,

00:29:11.890 --> 00:29:14.582
then when you come to do an audit,

00:29:14.583 --> 00:29:17.750
the items found will
be the edge cases

00:29:17.750 --> 00:29:21.300
and not the... I don’t know,
another alt tag of logo

00:29:21.300 --> 00:29:23.850
when it's not even a logo.

00:29:25.190 --> 00:29:27.420
And if the plugins or
things do not allow you

00:29:27.420 --> 00:29:30.790
to create accessible content,
others are available.

00:29:30.790 --> 00:29:33.620
They are like search engines,
there's always others available.

00:29:33.620 --> 00:29:37.370
And if there isn't one that suits
your needs, ask the community,

00:29:37.370 --> 00:29:45.370
because I'm sure that they
will be able to advise you

00:29:45.410 --> 00:29:48.220
on what they recommend,
including Joe,

00:29:48.220 --> 00:29:49.860
who might have
authored one himself.

00:29:51.290 --> 00:29:53.010
Anyway, questions?

00:29:56.196 --> 00:29:58.170
 <v Joost> We do have
a question lined up,

00:29:58.170 --> 00:30:01.270
and I actually have some
questions too, but let's start

00:30:01.270 --> 00:30:04.010
with a question from
Yohann in Sales.

00:30:04.010 --> 00:30:06.600
I'm assuming he's Dutch,
I'm not butchering his name.

00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:13.760
This AI or machine learning,
can it now do accessibility for us?

00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:15.250
Will we get to that point?

00:30:15.250 --> 00:30:21.650
If you stop screen sharing,
we can see you a bit better.

00:30:21.650 --> 00:30:23.970
 <v Helen> Are you sure you want to?

00:30:23.970 --> 00:30:24.740
I don't know.

00:30:25.820 --> 00:30:26.740
 <v Joost> Yes, I'm sure.

00:30:26.740 --> 00:30:30.960
 <v Helen> But anyway, AI,
I do think I should chat

00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:32.390
to Chris Land about that one.

00:30:32.390 --> 00:30:38.210
But when it comes to AI,
it's getting there, but it's only

00:30:38.210 --> 00:30:40.060
as clever as the people
that programme it.

00:30:40.060 --> 00:30:45.670
I know that when Facebook
first introduced AI for images,

00:30:45.670 --> 00:30:49.270
I'd post a photo of my son
with a knight's helmet on,

00:30:49.270 --> 00:30:54.060
and the alternative text computed
would be person, indoors,

00:30:54.060 --> 00:30:55.620
maybe wearing shoes.

00:30:55.620 --> 00:30:57.180
And I'm like, hang
on, there's a helmet?

00:30:57.180 --> 00:30:57.860
What?

00:30:57.860 --> 00:31:03.600
And I do find that
when it comes to AI,

00:31:05.990 --> 00:31:10.910
it can be incredibly intelligent,
but it's gaining this knowledge

00:31:10.910 --> 00:31:12.290
from what we're telling it.

00:31:13.340 --> 00:31:15.660
So if we're not putting
meaningful alternative text

00:31:15.660 --> 00:31:20.760
when it gets it wrong,
it's not going to be able to learn.

00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:24.180
So obviously,
I'm always correcting AI,

00:31:24.180 --> 00:31:28.650
because my son is always wearing
shoes... well, sometimes he doesn't.

00:31:28.650 --> 00:31:30.190
Oh dear, yes, anyway.

00:31:31.210 --> 00:31:34.910
But maybe wearing shoes did get
me because I did wonder, like,

00:31:34.910 --> 00:31:38.500
how much is the AI being trained
by people obsessed with shoes.

00:31:40.900 --> 00:31:48.460
But when using alternative text,
I do think that when we amend it,

00:31:48.460 --> 00:31:51.040
and when there's AI involved,
I know that Facebook quite often

00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:53.870
will sell my data back to
whatever machines are learning

00:31:53.870 --> 00:31:56.460
in the background because we all
know they're there to make money.

00:31:57.650 --> 00:32:00.090
You get something for free,
so they've got to make money

00:32:00.090 --> 00:32:01.400
out of you somehow.

00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:05.090
I sound so dark there.

00:32:05.090 --> 00:32:10.660
But anyway, when it comes to AI,
yes, it could do accessibility

00:32:10.660 --> 00:32:12.280
for you to a point.

00:32:14.020 --> 00:32:18.940
And this is where we have to
be able to edit ourselves.

00:32:18.940 --> 00:32:21.910
This is why I find the
overlays dangerous.

00:32:21.910 --> 00:32:25.830
Because they are using a form of
AI where they inject JavaScript

00:32:25.830 --> 00:32:29.040
into your site and sometimes
make it less accessible

00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:32.770
in the first place because
of what they've added in.

00:32:32.770 --> 00:32:35.390
And they make it so that
you don't edit it yourself.

00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:40.390
How is that helping anyone?

00:32:40.390 --> 00:32:44.600
How are they learning from
the mistakes they make?

00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:48.342
True AI will make
suggestions and then learn

00:32:48.343 --> 00:32:50.670
from the feedback you give.

00:32:50.670 --> 00:32:56.090
I know that because Christopher
Land does do a lot of talks on AI,

00:32:56.090 --> 00:32:59.930
and he's very
entertaining with them.

00:32:59.930 --> 00:33:03.870
And one of the things I've noticed
is when he's talking about it,

00:33:03.870 --> 00:33:08.080
he does examples of Dall-E, where
they do the art from suggestions.

00:33:09.100 --> 00:33:15.850
And as a point of, if anyone tells
Dall-E... I forget now, but anyway

00:33:15.850 --> 00:33:16.570
 <v Joost> Dall-E.

00:33:16.570 --> 00:33:20.290
 <v Helen> I'm thinking of
Dolly the sheep now, aren't I?

00:33:20.290 --> 00:33:27.440
Yes, anyway, but if everyone told
Dall-E that a car was a plane,

00:33:29.220 --> 00:33:34.380
when it had to do artwork of
a car and it shows a plane,

00:33:34.380 --> 00:33:36.580
it's not wrong, it's just
going by what it's been told.

00:33:37.690 --> 00:33:41.090
So if we're not telling the
AI, or we're not nurturing...

00:33:41.090 --> 00:33:44.220
I know someone was saying to me
once that AI is like a toddler,

00:33:44.220 --> 00:33:46.800
and as I have a toddler,
I know how it goes.

00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:49.860
You have to nurture them so that
they learn right from wrong.

00:33:49.860 --> 00:33:52.910
But you also have to put up
with a lot of temper tantrums,

00:33:52.910 --> 00:33:54.970
and messes along the way.

00:33:54.970 --> 00:33:58.140
It's a learning
process for everyone.

00:33:58.140 --> 00:34:06.140
And if we don't teach AI, hopefully
that human life is worth saving...

00:34:06.650 --> 00:34:08.150
just putting it out there.

00:34:08.150 --> 00:34:13.290
But if we don't teach AI
empathy and understanding,

00:34:13.290 --> 00:34:15.540
how will it do accessibility well?

00:34:15.540 --> 00:34:23.540
So it's not there yet, but I do
believe it will get there if,

00:34:24.420 --> 00:34:29.250
but only if we help
teach a bit to them.

00:34:29.250 --> 00:34:32.380
And yes, Yohan, it's fun,
isn't it, having children

00:34:32.380 --> 00:34:35.080
that don't like sleeping
at certain times?

00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:37.350
 <v Joost> I can tell.

00:34:37.350 --> 00:34:42.400
I've got four kids who are luckily
now slightly older than toddler age,

00:34:42.400 --> 00:34:43.860
so I can actually sleep.

00:34:43.860 --> 00:34:47.200
 <v Helen> Oh, no, then you stay
up wondering where they are

00:34:47.200 --> 00:34:48.390
if they don't come home on time.

00:34:49.225 --> 00:34:51.360
 <v Joost> Oh, yes,
don't get me started.

00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:53.680
 <v Helen> Yes, anyway.

00:34:53.680 --> 00:34:57.940
 <v Joost> I see a question
from Joe by way of Estella.

00:34:57.940 --> 00:35:01.690
Can you provide a concrete
example of automated content?

00:35:01.690 --> 00:35:05.110
What's a practical scenario
people might encounter

00:35:05.110 --> 00:35:07.530
where automated content
is being created?

00:35:11.081 --> 00:35:12.206
 <v Helen> OK.

00:35:13.770 --> 00:35:18.780
If you use Word and
you paste in an image,

00:35:19.930 --> 00:35:23.690
it will generate
alternative text and it has

00:35:23.690 --> 00:35:29.000
a sentence underneath it
saying, auto generated content.

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:31.930
And then that gets flagged
in the accessibility checker

00:35:31.930 --> 00:35:34.470
because that's a phrase
it looks for to make sure

00:35:34.470 --> 00:35:39.040
that you've checked that the
alternative text is valid.

00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:43.500
That's great because it not
only tells you what it does,

00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:50.420
that it's done the alternative
text, but it also trying.

00:35:50.420 --> 00:35:55.240
So those are the automated
content that's being created.

00:35:57.210 --> 00:36:01.220
And like Facebook, again,
it does say, might be.

00:36:01.220 --> 00:36:02.390
It never says it definitely is.

00:36:02.390 --> 00:36:06.530
It will say, could be this,
because it knows it might be wrong.

00:36:06.530 --> 00:36:11.590
But not everyone will know that
something has been automated

00:36:11.590 --> 00:36:16.130
because not all tools will do
that in an easy to spot way.

00:36:17.180 --> 00:36:21.180
So if you've got a tool that
generates alternative text

00:36:21.180 --> 00:36:24.950
that you haven't created, it wasn't
from the original source file,

00:36:24.950 --> 00:36:29.380
and it's incorrect, then it's
going to make you look a bit

00:36:29.380 --> 00:36:33.080
of a [Inaudible 36:30]

00:36:33.080 --> 00:36:35.750
for not having the right term
in your alternative text.

00:36:35.750 --> 00:36:39.880
So that's something that I
recommend checking in your plugins.

00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:45.060
If it does the AI side of things,
does it make it easy for you

00:36:45.060 --> 00:36:46.050
to spot it has done it?

00:36:48.140 --> 00:36:49.280
 <v Joost> Clear.

00:36:49.280 --> 00:36:54.370
So for everyone listening and
viewing, there's a Q & A button

00:36:54.370 --> 00:36:58.590
in the lower part of your Zoom screen
where you can add your questions.

00:36:58.590 --> 00:37:01.860
We have one more question
from Gina Sheldrake.

00:37:01.860 --> 00:37:06.350
She asks, as plugins go, or themes,
are there any resources out there

00:37:06.350 --> 00:37:10.440
to assist in helping us understand
who is real and who is not

00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:12.460
in their accessible
plug-ins and themes?

00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:18.540
Sorry to answer this on your
behalf, Helen, but I do know

00:37:18.540 --> 00:37:22.410
from the chat that Joe
Dolson just shared a link

00:37:22.410 --> 00:37:28.510
to the WordPress accessibility team’s
list of plugins that they have,

00:37:28.510 --> 00:37:32.410
that help you to actually improve
your site that are not overlays,

00:37:32.410 --> 00:37:37.760
like the ones that Helen
was, so kindfully addressing.

00:37:39.580 --> 00:37:43.970
Well, yes, so there is a list,
but are there any other things

00:37:43.970 --> 00:37:46.530
that you would like to add to
that, Helen?

00:37:46.530 --> 00:37:50.270
Other resources that
you would go to?

00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:54.690
 <v Helen> Ask the
community, as a first point.

00:37:54.690 --> 00:38:00.980
And also check the company that
makes it, because I instantly knew

00:38:00.980 --> 00:38:06.360
when I see a Accessaby or
just looking at the list now

00:38:06.360 --> 00:38:09.280
that I got open here.

00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:12.150
So when you go through the
list and you see a company name

00:38:12.150 --> 00:38:16.340
that you know is an overlay
provider, like Userway,

00:38:16.340 --> 00:38:21.160
that tells me don't use
it, it's going to enforce

00:38:21.160 --> 00:38:27.540
what it thinks should be done,
or is programmed should be done.

00:38:27.540 --> 00:38:32.380
I should never blame the actual
tool itself because it's only

00:38:32.380 --> 00:38:35.760
as good as a program that makes
it and it's best intentions,

00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:37.710
but yes anyway.

00:38:39.560 --> 00:38:41.850
But also,
when I go through the descriptions,

00:38:41.850 --> 00:38:49.850
if I see something like it's paid
for, it will change items for you.

00:38:50.910 --> 00:38:53.710
You don't have to do any
of the work yourself.

00:38:54.730 --> 00:38:58.410
That’s a snake oil bit,
that's a bit that everyone goes for

00:38:58.410 --> 00:39:05.500
because it's telling you
exactly the easy route.

00:39:05.500 --> 00:39:11.570
If it's too easy, then you're
not able to change it yourself,

00:39:11.570 --> 00:39:14.110
and then that means you
can be producing complete

00:39:15.490 --> 00:39:18.960
insert rude words there,
rather than something that's going

00:39:18.960 --> 00:39:20.020
to help your audience.

00:39:21.900 --> 00:39:25.780
 <v Joost> Yes, if it sounds too
good to be true, it often is,

00:39:25.780 --> 00:39:29.260
as Jonathan already
said in the chat.

00:39:29.260 --> 00:39:32.060
But I think if you're looking
for the resources, you've come

00:39:32.060 --> 00:39:32.930
to the right place.

00:39:32.930 --> 00:39:34.970
I mean,
you're here listening to this,

00:39:34.970 --> 00:39:37.680
join the WordPress
accessibility day slack.

00:39:37.680 --> 00:39:41.840
You'll find tons of people willing
to help you find the right plug-ins

00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:45.190
and resources for
all of these things.

00:39:45.190 --> 00:39:48.090
Now, I have a question
myself, Helen.

00:39:48.090 --> 00:39:52.180
How much extra work is
it to add an ATAG check

00:39:52.180 --> 00:39:54.257
to your accessibility audit,

00:39:54.258 --> 00:39:57.520
and where would you
put it in the process?

00:40:01.100 --> 00:40:06.960
 <v Helen> It incorporates
WCAG, If it's just for me

00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:12.110
and my personal use,
I do part B on the items I'm using

00:40:12.110 --> 00:40:15.510
to make sure that if I'm
producing content that I'm able

00:40:15.510 --> 00:40:20.740
to not be blocked It's like when I
get enforced, the company says I have

00:40:20.740 --> 00:40:25.050
to use this product and then I
can't create graphs for my reports

00:40:25.050 --> 00:40:26.050
that are accessible.

00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:28.300
It's so frustrating.

00:40:28.300 --> 00:40:32.380
And it's that sort of thing,
making sure that I can do what I need

00:40:32.380 --> 00:40:34.260
to do without getting frustrated.

00:40:35.380 --> 00:40:36.610
So that doesn't take a lot.

00:40:36.610 --> 00:40:38.500
And that's just a common
sense kind of thing.

00:40:38.500 --> 00:40:43.500
But when it comes to the audit
itself, it doesn't take a lot extra

00:40:43.500 --> 00:40:46.590
from the WCAG because
you quite often

00:40:46.590 --> 00:40:50.100
from doing the web content
accessibility guideline checks,

00:40:50.100 --> 00:40:52.350
you will notice the
alternative text,

00:40:52.350 --> 00:40:56.370
you'll notice the keyboard
accessibility and so on,

00:40:56.370 --> 00:40:58.290
because that's part of it there.

00:40:59.380 --> 00:41:02.110
But remember if you're using
an application it's not going

00:41:02.110 --> 00:41:04.410
to be like for like with
websites where you've got

00:41:04.410 --> 00:41:07.050
the same keyboard shortcuts.

00:41:07.050 --> 00:41:14.030
So one thing I recommend when
it comes to ATAG is making sure

00:41:14.030 --> 00:41:16.040
that it is an authoring
tool first off.

00:41:16.040 --> 00:41:18.740
If it's not an authoring tool,
you're not creating content.

00:41:18.740 --> 00:41:20.310
If it's really easy,
don't do it at all.

00:41:21.450 --> 00:41:25.590
But when it comes to creating
content, it's important on a personal

00:41:25.590 --> 00:41:30.140
and on an audit way
because it does extras.

00:41:30.140 --> 00:41:33.460
It's like it's looking at the
support, it's looking at the help.

00:41:33.460 --> 00:41:35.060
And that doesn't
take too long at all.

00:41:35.060 --> 00:41:39.450
If it takes you a long time to do
that part, it's not accessible.

00:41:39.450 --> 00:41:40.640
That's always a big giveaway.

00:41:41.790 --> 00:41:42.560
So yes.

00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:43.830
Sorry, a long-winded answer there.

00:41:44.820 --> 00:41:46.380
 <v Joost> Not a problem.

00:41:46.380 --> 00:41:50.730
So you were alluding to it a
bit already, but how do I know

00:41:50.730 --> 00:41:53.210
if I need to check
for ATAG guidelines?

00:41:55.540 --> 00:41:56.570
 <v Helen> When it frustrates you.

00:41:56.570 --> 00:41:58.140
[Laughs]

00:41:58.140 --> 00:42:00.560
When you're trying
to create content,

00:42:01.730 --> 00:42:03.890
if it's something that's
rendering your content,

00:42:03.890 --> 00:42:06.120
then that's user agent
accessibility guidelines.

00:42:07.450 --> 00:42:10.180
I know that when I first
started doing mobile testing,

00:42:10.181 --> 00:42:12.044
everyone's like, Oh,
WC, it doesn't count.

00:42:12.045 --> 00:42:13.430
I said, well, actually it does.

00:42:13.430 --> 00:42:19.690
Because your mobile app is the user
agent that's rendering the content.

00:42:19.690 --> 00:42:24.090
So it's still available online, but
it's not in the recognized browser.

00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:29.308
So yes, it's not always
one-size-fits-all,

00:42:29.309 --> 00:42:31.950
but understanding that you're

00:42:31.950 --> 00:42:36.090
on the developer side, you're the
creator and the tools you need,

00:42:36.090 --> 00:42:36.670
need ATAG.

00:42:38.380 --> 00:42:39.780
 <v Joost> Perfect.

00:42:39.780 --> 00:42:44.550
Well, with that, we've come to
the end of our list of questions,

00:42:44.550 --> 00:42:47.830
and with that also the
end of this session.

00:42:47.830 --> 00:42:49.880
So thank you all for attending.

00:42:49.880 --> 00:42:53.260
Thank you, Helen,
for your excellent presentation.

00:42:53.260 --> 00:42:55.420
You can continue the
conversation in chat

00:42:55.420 --> 00:42:58.161
or on social media
using the hashtags,

00:42:58.162 --> 00:43:01.420
and these are extremely hard
to pronounce.

00:43:01.420 --> 00:43:03.230
I don't know why they do that.

00:43:03.230 --> 00:43:07.006
#WPA11YDay is like,
how do I pronounce that,

00:43:07.007 --> 00:43:09.440
WordPress Accessibility Day?

00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:15.110
OK, I understand that, but
that's the hashtag, or #WPAD2023.

00:43:15.110 --> 00:43:16.920
We also really appreciate
it, if you go

00:43:16.920 --> 00:43:24.470
to 2023.wpeaccessibility.day/feedback
to provide anonymous feedback

00:43:24.470 --> 00:43:26.228

00:43:55.860 --> 00:43:56.860

Oh, and if you're an overlay
company, I do not want feedback.

00:44:01.070 --> 00:44:02.290

Just saying.
