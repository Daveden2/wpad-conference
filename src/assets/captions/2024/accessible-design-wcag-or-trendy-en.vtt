00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:03.599
<v Announcer> WordPress
Accessibility Day 2024.

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.179
Accessible Design.

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:07.319
WCAG or trendy?

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:10.319
No, WCAG and trendy.

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.519
With speaker Zsolt Edelényi

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:15.554
Certified Professional
in Web Accessibility.

00:00:15.555 --> 00:00:19.080
His presentation
was recorded October 2024.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.799
<v Kelly Crowley> Welcome, everybody.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.159
Welcome to WordPress
Accessibility Day 2024.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.420
My name is Kelly Crowley

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:31.120
and I am an accessible design consultant,
a writer, and a coach.

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:35.039
I'm also a Paralympian
and a member of the disability community.

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.999
Thank you for joining us
for accessible design.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.679
WCAG or trendy?

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.120
No, WCAG and trendy.

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.000
With Zsolt Edelényi.

00:00:45.126 --> 00:00:49.479
Zsolt is a certified professional in web
accessibility based in Hungary.

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.839
He delved into the realm of accessibility
a decade ago after witnessing

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.879
the challenges his blind
wife faced accessing websites.

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:00.839
He believes that ensuring access
to digital products is inevitable

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.879
for long-term success
and ethical business practices.

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:07.759
Previously, Zsolt developed
over 100 accessible

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.319
WordPress suites using his own theme.

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.879
Currently, he leads audits
and guides organizations towards

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.926
achieving accessibility
and maturity via consulting.

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.279
During the webinar, please feel free
to use the Q&amp;A section in Zoom to ask

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.799
your questions and we'll answer
them at the end of the session.

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.159
You can use the chat to connect
with other attendees.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.060
Now I'll turn it over to you, Zsolt.

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.919
<v Zsolt Edelényi> Thank you very much.

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.234
Can you see my presentation?

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:44.920
I share it.

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.071
Thank you everyone for coming

00:01:51.072 --> 00:01:54.837
and thank you for pronouncing
my name very well.

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.092
I'm really passionate about accessibility.

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.239
My wife is blind and I am deaf in one ear

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.890
and I also have color
blindness and dysgraphia.

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:11.640
I have a story.

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.719
Hearing with only one ear,

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:20.079
it's impossible for me to identify
where sounds are coming from.

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.839
After about a month of dating,

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.799
we went for a walk on a beautiful island
by the Danube.

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.599
We heard music playing.

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.493
My wife asked, "What's that sound?"

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.639
I said to her, "If you can tell
me where it's coming from,

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.360
I can tell you what it is."

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:43.199
This story represents
the connection between people.

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.040
We need to work
together to get things done.

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.119
This experience tells
me that collaboration

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.920
is key to overcoming challenges.

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.879
Accessibility is no different.

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.599
It's about creating
an environment where everyone,

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:07.520
regardless of their abilities,
can participate fully and independently.

00:03:08.376 --> 00:03:12.719
Whether it's navigating
a website or booking a seat at a concert,

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.239
accessibility ensures
that everyone can get

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:20.320
things done efficiently and in dignity.

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.160
Just picture this.

00:03:23.396 --> 00:03:27.879
A user asks a computer for available
seats in a music hall.

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:31.559
The designer would write
squares with an X inside for booked

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:36.320
seats and green squares
with a dot inside for available ones.

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.960
This is inclusive for everybody.

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.919
Even the color-blind user
can select a free seat

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:49.200
because not only the color but
the dot inside makes them different.

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:53.000
Learning objectives.

00:03:54.405 --> 00:03:58.769
We have three practical
outcomes from this presentation.

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.879
First of all,

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:07.279
many people think that a trendy website
cannot be accessible.

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:12.600
I offer a fresh look and show
a new way of designing a website.

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:17.039
Second, we the experts overemphasize

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:21.007
the Web Content Accessibility
Guidelines, the WCAG.

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.840
It's a standard, not a method.

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:28.860
The success criteria is important,
but even more important

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:32.880
to know your users
with different abilities.

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:37.119
In addition,
many people think that it's enough

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.373
to comply with the law by using a plugin.

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:45.321
If you have a trendy website,
why would you need an overlay?

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:49.439
Accessibility comes
from a website owner's strategy

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:52.959
called Accessibility In Mind.

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.959
If you succeed,
your site will be available

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:58.799
to users with disabilities.

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:02.059
In addition, the majority of your users

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:06.120
will get an even better user experience.

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:11.720
In my presentation, I include three polls,

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:17.799
and you can see the QR code
on my presentation.

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:23.120
Please scan it,
or there is a URL in the chat,

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:27.600
and if you go there, you can use the poll.

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:36.439
What's the first word that comes to mind

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:39.455
when you think of a trendy web design?

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:47.720
If you have a phone or you have the URL,
please vote.

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:55.479
I'm telling you that I've already made
this poll with other presentations.

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:59.760
I received many different answers.

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:03.299
Most of them are extremely the same

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:06.315
what I think of the trendy web design.

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:10.159
This number is, I don't understand this.

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:11.360
Thank you.

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:13.829
You can say anyone what you think.

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:16.734
Aesthetic, flashy, that's very good.

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:20.934
Aesthetic is very, very, very important.

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:25.680
Low contrast.

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:33.359
I've never heard that,
but I admire your one.

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:34.560
Gradient.

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:41.099
Gradient means that you like to use

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:45.959
very advanced UX elements.

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:47.160
Animated.

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:51.359
Yes, this creates
a more engaging user experience.

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:52.550
That's good.

00:06:53.900 --> 00:07:00.099
Customizable, flashy, fast, simple,

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:03.880
low contrast, sexy, responsive,

00:07:03.966 --> 00:07:09.360
gradient, aesthetic,
beautiful, and usable colors.

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:14.879
I'm still missing some points.

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:19.323
These are very important
that there are new items for me.

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:25.400
I see that many of you like simplicity
and ease of use.

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:31.813
That's very close to accessibility.

00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:37.439
[?] I think it's enough for now.

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:38.719
Thank you very much.

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:42.080
I'm going to continue my presentation.

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:52.164
The next is that what I think
of a trendy web design is.

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:55.919
It means applying three points.

00:07:55.920 --> 00:08:00.240
First of all, something that is not new,

00:08:00.302 --> 00:08:03.920
a trendy website based
on basic UX principles.

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:06.169
These are the followings.

00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:08.011
Clear page hierarchy.

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:10.797
Simple and consistent labels.

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:14.920
Consistent menus
and layouts across the pages.

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:18.799
Micro animations, such as hour effects.

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:24.240
Loading indicators and responsiveness,
but real responsiveness,

00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:27.662
where all views retain full functionality.

00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:29.560
Just a side note.

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:35.919
This principle what I've listed
is available in my speaker's note

00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:41.474
of my presentation that will be available
on the website of this event.

00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:43.879
My second point of trendy website

00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:48.480
is using advanced functions and features.

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:51.599
Some examples.

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:53.919
Making voice recognition and screen reader

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:56.960
software compatible with the website.

00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:02.359
Integrating social media platforms,
such as Facebook, X, and YouTube.

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:07.041
Using modern site interactions,
such as tabs and drop downs.

00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:11.249
Applying modern client
scripts like AJAX search.

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:15.319
The good news
is that every function and feature

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:19.120
can be implemented in an accessible way.

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:25.440
Finally, trendy sites use
enhanced visuals like followings.

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:28.319
High-quality videos and photos.

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:32.799
Special effects like parallax scrolling,
simple, clear,

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:36.080
and well-sized call-to-action buttons,

00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:41.359
organic shapes, flowing borders,
three-dimensional elements,

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:44.760
and gradient and shadows as you mentioned.

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:50.811
I listed four domains.

00:09:50.812 --> 00:09:54.960
General, colors,
dynamic elements, and targets.

00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:57.200
Where are they from?

00:09:57.640 --> 00:10:02.279
I made a list of 50 points
for creating an inclusive webpage

00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:05.479
but we don't have many hours
to go through.

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:10.079
Therefore, I grouped them
into 10 categories and picked

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:13.333
only the four most important to focus on.

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:17.880
Now I can spend 7 minutes on each one.

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:21.600
At the end, I'll provide
you with resources

00:10:21.650 --> 00:10:24.047
where you can go on learning.

00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:32.600
The first area, general guidelines.

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:36.440
Know your users.

00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:41.285
You need to know more than just
WCAG success criteria.

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:46.440
You also need to understand
different abilities of users.

00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:51.819
I mean different abilities,
not disabilities.

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:55.440
Accessibility is for everyone.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.759
If there are blocking errors,
some users can't use your website

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:04.600
at all and many other people
find it more difficult to use.

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:10.879
There are many users whose abilities
are different from an average user.

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:12.959
However, they are not disabled.

00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:19.479
For example, users with dyslexia,
colorblindness like me,

00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:24.879
hearing impairment,
ADHD, many people have.

00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:31.559
Autism spectrum disorder,
just a broken arm, or a headache.

00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:33.879
A headache can make it hard to think.

00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:37.999
You might throw your phone
out of the window if you can't solve

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.727
the reCAPTCHA for the fifth time.

00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:46.079
In addition, there are many special
circumstances that require

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:50.760
inclusive design like browsing
on a sunny beach,

00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:54.656
watching a video in a silent library,

00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:57.815
using a laptop with a broken touchpad.

00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:00.959
These examples are only a few.

00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:03.019
You can find more than 100

00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:06.273
on the speaker's note of my presentation.

00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:11.200
All right, let's talk
about the disabilities now.

00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:13.471
These can be very distinct.

00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:16.319
The Paralympics finished a month ago.

00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:18.479
You may have watched some competition.

00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:20.399
I enjoyed the wheelchair rugby.

00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:23.479
They move fast like a bunch of cars.

00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:27.999
The classification has 67 categories,
each different.

00:12:28.073 --> 00:12:34.740
For example, athletes in T11
and T12 can run only with a guide.

00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:38.210
Lack of screen reader
support on your sides

00:12:38.211 --> 00:12:41.400
creates a blocking barrier for them.

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:45.159
Some people are born with disabilities,

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:48.334
while others acquire them later in life.

00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:53.028
Disabilities can be either
permanent or temporary.

00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:58.799
One thing they all have in common
is that when a person visits

00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:04.799
a website and encounters
difficulty with a basic contact form,

00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:08.360
it can result in feelings of humiliation.

00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:16.680
In 1997, Tim Berners-Lee,
the inventor of the World Wide Web said,

00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:20.771
'The power of the Web
is in its universality.

00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:27.594
Access by everyone, regardless
of disability, is an essential aspect."

00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:34.079
How shall we start designing for everyone?

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:36.160
How early shall we start?

00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:40.159
We should start from the definition
of the goals and objectives.

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:43.171
Here is an example for a good definition.

00:13:43.172 --> 00:13:48.520
Websites we design
will maximize accessibility and UX.

00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:53.649
I will go into the details
into user stories.

00:13:53.650 --> 00:13:56.879
Although some designers may not use them,

00:13:56.880 --> 00:13:59.895
I want to illustrate their usefulness.

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:04.599
If you want to create
a professional website,

00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:09.439
user stories are the best place
to outline all your expectations,

00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:11.685
including accessibility.

00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:14.879
I give you some examples
that how are these coming

00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:17.607
from the knowledge of your users.

00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:21.559
The template of the user story
is the following.

00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:27.160
As a user, I want to do something,
so I can do that.

00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:33.560
As a deaf user, I want all website
videos to have accurate captions,

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:37.320
so I can follow the audio content.

00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:42.800
As a user working outdoors
in bright sunlight on a mobile phone,

00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:46.439
I want the website to have enough
color contrast,

00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:50.640
so I can get the phone number
of the desired service.

00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:52.599
As a colorblind user,

00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:56.959
I want information presented
in ways other than just color,

00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:59.906
so I can book a seat without help.

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:03.119
As a blind user,
I want the website to work

00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:05.879
fully with my screen reader,

00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:11.800
so I can navigate
into another page of the website.

00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:16.653
Again, more examples in a speaker's mode.

00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:20.759
If you consider
the specific needs of your users

00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:24.759
at the very beginning
of the design process, you will end up

00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:28.172
with a product that can be used
by everyone.

00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:34.079
Just to imagine the absurdity
of some accessibility plugins,

00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:37.000
here is a fictitious user story.

00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:43.679
As a user with cognitive impairment,
I want the border of all targets,

00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:48.280
so I can activate
the cognitive disability profile.

00:15:51.669 --> 00:15:54.399
Go another key point
in the general section,

00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:59.680
construct the best design processes,
and choose the best tools.

00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:02.519
Some design tools, such as Stigma,

00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:07.267
offer strong accessibility features,
while others don't.

00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:10.519
Choosing the right tools
can save money and ensure

00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:14.725
that your design
is on the right track from the start.

00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:18.199
I'm not going to talk about
the shift left process here,

00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:21.197
because you are probably aware
that catching

00:16:21.198 --> 00:16:27.120
errors late increases
cost really significantly.

00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:33.240
If an acceptance test uncovers
a problem caused by poor design,

00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:35.994
it would cost 40 times more.

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:39.279
I give you a best practice.

00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:42.879
To make a team of your front-end
developers more efficient,

00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:46.640
establish a clear token naming convention.

00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:51.080
This is for translating
visual design into code.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:57.760
Design tokens are design decisions
that are translated into data.

00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:00.239
Using this,

00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:04.799
developers should be able to look
at the design file and easily find

00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:10.116
the specific design tokens
for a simple name of typography elements.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.799
This can be instructions, anything else.

00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:19.579
For example, design tokens represented

00:17:19.580 --> 00:17:24.000
in Figma by variables,
styles, or annotations.

00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:28.039
What kind of tokens can you add?

00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:33.760
You can add the accessible name
as annotations for a button with an icon.

00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:37.479
You can add a user preference
token to a dynamic element

00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:41.480
that keep disabled
by a user preference settings.

00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:46.086
You can add a token
for the name of the main region.

00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:50.879
These tokens can be added
by an accessibility designer or expert.

00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:55.679
Without them, developers
have to figure things out for themselves,

00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:59.012
which can lead to errors and higher costs.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.239
As many of you have noticed,

00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:08.120
I said that designers also need
to be aware of accessibility.

00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:12.239
Having the right knowledge
can significantly reduce

00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:15.652
the cost of developing
a conforming product.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.839
It's a good idea to bring
in an accessibility expert to help

00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:22.959
the product owner to clarify

00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:27.720
the definition of done
and also to review tasks.

00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:33.800
Use of colors.

00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:41.079
In my introduction, I've already mentioned
the rule that information

00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:46.280
should be conveyed in different
sensory types, not only colors.

00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:52.560
This lets 10 to 20% more users
be satisfied with your website.

00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:57.920
The wording of the related success
criteria is the following.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:02.999
Color is not used as the only visual
means of conveying information,

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.479
indicating an action,
prompting a response,

00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:09.373
or distinguishing a visual element.

00:19:10.153 --> 00:19:13.679
Colors are not enough,
but what are the other visual means?

00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:16.919
These can be symbols, size, patterns,

00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:22.880
shapes, borders, tooltips,
lines, fonts, and so on.

00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:31.759
Without going into details,
I recommend the very best practice

00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:34.854
when starting a new design or redesign.

00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:38.047
Make the color palette inclusive.

00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:40.839
If you create the right colors
at the very beginning,

00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:44.520
you won't have to worry too much about

00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:50.200
the contrast later
in the redesign process.

00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:53.046
Let's say your primary brand color

00:19:53.047 --> 00:19:55.279
is deep blue with a slight greenish tinge.

00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:57.879
This color works
well on a white background

00:19:57.880 --> 00:20:01.119
and can be used for either
a background or a text.

00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:04.079
The secondary color is a light cyan
that has a contrast ratio

00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:08.880
of 1.58 to 1 to the primary brand color.

00:20:08.973 --> 00:20:11.159
We need to find a third that is suitable

00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:14.199
for indicating different states
of components.

00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:16.999
For example, in a radial bottom circle,

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:20.174
a checkbox square, or a focus indicator.

00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:25.520
This needs to have a 3 to 1 contrast
ratio to the brand color.

00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:28.647
This pink would be good for that.

00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:32.639
Now comes the hardest part.

00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:36.954
We need to choose two different colors
for the link and the text.

00:20:36.955 --> 00:20:42.719
Both need a contrast ratio
of 1.5 to 1 to white

00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:46.240
and a contrast ratio
of 3 to 1 to each other.

00:20:47.657 --> 00:20:50.039
Adding color pairs to your color palette

00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:53.531
makes it easier to apply
them to your design.

00:20:56.160 --> 00:20:58.309
Some other considerations.

00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:03.799
Trendy designs often use
gradient backgrounds for text,

00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:09.116
especially in key areas such
as headlines or call-to-action buttons.

00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:11.279
Smooth gradients with gentler transitions

00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:14.519
are less likely to interfere
with readability.

00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:16.919
Avoid complex backgrounds or patterns

00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:22.077
to the text because it can make reading
more difficult and slower.

00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:26.239
According to WCAG,
the use of gradient is acceptable

00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:30.842
as long as all the colors meet
the required contrast ratio.

00:21:32.503 --> 00:21:38.040
Another best practice
which definitely works in the long run,

00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:44.640
create a second palette
with limited and reversed colors.

00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:49.360
You can use the same tokens
as the original palette,

00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:53.840
and developers
will be able to create it in no time.

00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:59.519
The second theme will be used
in the preferred colors scheme.

00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:01.799
This is a new CSS
feature that is supported

00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:04.362
by all major operating systems.

00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:07.799
The reason is that many people
use dark mode,

00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:09.919
and by creating this second theme,

00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:14.284
your dark mode users will get
the site with your colors.

00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:17.619
I need to talk about the relationship

00:22:17.620 --> 00:22:20.430
between color and visual overload.

00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:26.279
The question is, should that design
be simple or full of information?

00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:29.005
Some users suffer from visual overload

00:22:29.006 --> 00:22:33.159
when there is a lot of text and links

00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:38.080
on a page but in many cases,
this is a necessity.

00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:43.199
Look at a webshop that requires
many visual elements such as badges,

00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:46.100
reviews, and additional information.

00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:51.920
It's a fact that too much
information can overwhelm users.

00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:55.679
A clean and simple
layout helps users focus

00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:59.171
while still delivering
the necessary content.

00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:04.200
Professional UX experts
are capable of solving this problem.

00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:07.439
They can categorize data into two groups.

00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:12.599
Some information should be hidden
because it's irrelevant to most users.

00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:14.939
Less important information
should be hidden

00:23:14.940 --> 00:23:18.719
by default and you can use
modern design elements

00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:21.758
to dissipate them upon user interaction.

00:23:21.759 --> 00:23:25.680
This can be tooltips, dropdowns, or tabs.

00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:32.610
If your design meets
these UX expectations,

00:23:32.611 --> 00:23:36.959
you don't need to use
too many colors or too little contrast.

00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:42.752
Finally, remember that non-HTML
contents also need to meet contrast ratio.

00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:50.600
Dynamic contents.

00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:54.588
Let's turn to our third domain,
dynamic contents.

00:23:54.589 --> 00:23:57.604
No website can be trendy without them.

00:23:57.640 --> 00:24:00.080
I show you some key points.

00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:04.205
The design of perpetuum mobiles.

00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:10.920
Following components that play
automatically and run in an endless loop.

00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:16.919
This can be animated GIFs,
hero videos, advertising videos,

00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:23.040
slideshow carousels, marquees,
infinite scrolls, and so on.

00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:26.759
The basic principles to use
them freely in web design,

00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:31.080
but ensure that users
can easily control them.

00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:35.599
Many users leave your website
if they cannot control it.

00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:39.719
Here are a few creative
solutions to provide control.

00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:42.080
Stop within five seconds.

00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:45.360
Use controls like stop, pause, start.

00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:50.360
Delay autoplay
and let the user explore control buttons.

00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:53.839
Add an overlay requiring
a click or keyboard

00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:56.567
activation to start the movement.

00:24:56.940 --> 00:25:00.800
Use confirmation dialogues
to let the user decide

00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:04.319
and allow browser and operating

00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:10.000
system settings to control dynamic
elements based on user preferences.

00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:14.333
Now we go to the second poll.

00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:22.599
Pointing back to a user story,

00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:26.480
such as creating user
preferences for a website.

00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:28.800
What is your experience?

00:25:29.385 --> 00:25:31.279
Please answer the following questions.

00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:37.240
Do you or anyone you know
use user preferences in any way?

00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:42.359
For example, I set up
my Android phone to show larger fonts,

00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:46.882
and I expect that web page
would apply my user preference.

00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:50.690
Currently, most of them ignore it.

00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:54.479
The possible answers.

00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:56.759
I don't know anyone who uses it.

00:25:56.760 --> 00:26:00.599
I know someone who uses
the operating system basic settings.

00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:05.040
This can be font size, colors,
and color temperature.

00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:08.359
I know someone who uses
the operating system

00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:11.377
accessibility features like screen reader,

00:26:11.378 --> 00:26:14.023
touch assistant, color contrast.

00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:18.804
I know someone who uses
browser settings or extensions.

00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:24.440
This can set font size, focus visibles,
and many other things.

00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:27.720
Maybe individual CSS.

00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:33.902
I know someone who uses
user preferences in other ways.

00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:40.080
If you don't mind, please write
your experience into the chat.

00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:48.700
I see very interesting polls.

00:26:49.180 --> 00:26:53.040
60% use browser settings or extensions.

00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:55.460
In my last presentation,

00:26:56.580 --> 00:27:02.720
there was nobody who polled this answer.

00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:07.880
No one uses operating system settings.

00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:19.440
It seems that everyone knows
somebody who uses preferences.

00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:29.440
Anyway, you can do the poll and continue

00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:37.320
but we can go
on because our time is short.

00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:49.580
The next consideration, be moderate.

00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:55.165
In my experience,
content is added without enough thought.

00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:57.639
This is the case in many times.

00:27:57.640 --> 00:28:02.399
For example, someone might think
that a moving GIF looks cool.

00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:06.839
Consequently, it is included
into the website without checking

00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:10.886
how it affects
the user experience or accessibility.

00:28:12.549 --> 00:28:15.719
While some people
might be impressed by dynamic elements,

00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:18.365
others would find them annoying.

00:28:18.619 --> 00:28:23.279
Trendy websites shouldn't choose
dynamic content just for fun.

00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:27.406
It's there to drive conversion
and share information.

00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:30.000
Here are a few advices.

00:28:30.515 --> 00:28:34.559
Limit parallax scrolling
to one instance per page.

00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:38.200
Keep dynamic elements small and shallow.

00:28:38.865 --> 00:28:41.539
Ensure that it's well-spaced

00:28:41.540 --> 00:28:46.080
from text and this increases readability.

00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:50.519
The good news
is that there are many types of inclusive

00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:54.487
dynamic content that work
well on a trendy website.

00:28:54.560 --> 00:28:58.679
I'm going to list some of them,
divided into four groups.

00:28:58.680 --> 00:29:03.282
Group one, organizing information
elements like drop-downs,

00:29:04.001 --> 00:29:08.639
also known as night show
or accordion components tabs,

00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:14.114
which is a very good component
to make content into a clear structure.

00:29:14.950 --> 00:29:20.583
Tooltips that provide additional
details without overwhelming the users.

00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:24.452
Group two, related
to forms like dialogues,

00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:30.360
auto-suggestions in field,
conditional form fields, combo boxes.

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:36.599
Group three, related to interaction
like real-time data updates,

00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:38.999
expandable image galleries,

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:44.160
interactive maps, augmented reality,
interactive sliders.

00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:47.319
Group four is content-related.

00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:53.200
Interactive infographics,
parallax scrolling, infinite scroll.

00:29:54.712 --> 00:30:00.119
Remember that the default use
of these elements is often not accessible,

00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:04.642
but all of them can be used
in a way that suits all users.

00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:09.031
Lastly, dynamic elements
increase cognitive loads.

00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:12.359
This may seem like a minor issue,
but it's not.

00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:14.719
People with reduced cognitive function,

00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:19.199
whether due to a headache,
stress, or a medical condition,

00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:22.136
may find these elements overwhelming.

00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:31.959
Our time is short,
so step into our last domain, targets.

00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:36.600
There are more types as follows,
links within text.

00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:38.999
It's crucial to distinguish links

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:42.491
from regular text using
more than just color.

00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:45.079
Navigation menu links.

00:30:45.080 --> 00:30:49.680
This often seems easy,
but careful planning is necessary,

00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:52.567
especially for complex megamenus.

00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:59.720
Consistency is key, even when menus
are different in pages or users.

00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:04.920
It's also important to make parent
menus easy to find.

00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:07.880
Application menu buttons.

00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:11.639
Application menus
are different from navigation menus.

00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:14.199
These are typically
associated with actions

00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:20.320
or commands within a web application
like save, open settings, and so on.

00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:22.781
Call to action buttons.

00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:26.279
This typically receives
significant design attention

00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:31.199
and usually meets accessibility
standards with a good contrast.

00:31:31.640 --> 00:31:33.639
Form targets like buttons, sliders,

00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:38.760
switches, auto-suggestions,
inactive buttons, and so on.

00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:45.120
Switches should be designed
so users can easily tell their status.

00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:51.120
Sliders need to display values
when navigated via keyboard.

00:31:52.420 --> 00:31:54.299
Auto-suggestions should have

00:31:54.300 --> 00:31:57.600
a good contrast and be resizable.

00:31:58.480 --> 00:32:02.559
Inactive buttons
don't have a minimum contrast requirement,

00:32:02.560 --> 00:32:05.100
but it's essential

00:32:05.380 --> 00:32:09.900
to clearly differentiate

00:32:09.940 --> 00:32:13.000
between active and inactive states.

00:32:14.196 --> 00:32:17.319
Player control buttons
for interacting with media

00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:23.160
players and special targets
like chessboard or locations.

00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:29.800
Designing special targets
requires specialized expertise.

00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:36.593
These targets need extra care due
to the complexity of user interaction.

00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:41.360
Top considerations.

00:32:41.520 --> 00:32:45.579
The target on a web page
is crucial for user interaction

00:32:45.580 --> 00:32:48.473
and must be available for everyone.

00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:54.011
Landing pages, which drive profits,
are typically very good.

00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:56.519
This is a proof that accessibility

00:32:56.520 --> 00:33:00.680
can directly contribute
to increased revenue.

00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:03.959
Here is a top list of my considerations.

00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:05.639
Proper contrast.

00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:11.035
Make sure that clickable links stand
out from non-clickable elements.

00:33:12.040 --> 00:33:13.479
Visual cues.

00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:18.240
Links should be distinct from non-links
in at least two ways.

00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:20.760
Proper sizing for touch.

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:25.919
Ensure that clickable areas
are large enough for touch interactions.

00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:28.079
The WCAG recommends a minimum size

00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:32.240
of 24 CSS pixel circles for touch areas,

00:33:34.440 --> 00:33:39.240
but for better usability
aim for an even bigger size.

00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:41.688
Responsiveness.

00:33:42.600 --> 00:33:47.159
Using only four or five different screens

00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:50.359
for simple design might not be enough.

00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:54.159
Sometimes a high-quality fluid
grid can help,

00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:58.000
but you might need
extra adjustments to make sure

00:33:58.142 --> 00:34:02.240
all content and functions
fit well on each viewport,

00:34:03.160 --> 00:34:08.000
and ensure that design
is consistent across different devices.

00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:11.000
Focus indicators.

00:34:11.160 --> 00:34:15.842
Design your site that there is enough
space for focus indicators.

00:34:15.843 --> 00:34:17.799
While you can use different visual cues,

00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:22.560
an outline is often the most practical
and consistent method.

00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:26.440
Clear and simple labeling.

00:34:26.840 --> 00:34:29.927
Use straightforward language for labels.

00:34:29.928 --> 00:34:35.520
While creative wording can be fun,
it may not be clear to everyone.

00:34:35.680 --> 00:34:38.400
For example, instead of saying,

00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:43.560
access restricted to individuals
aged 18 and above,

00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:47.480
simply say, 18 and older only.

00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:51.045
Differentiate links and buttons.

00:34:51.640 --> 00:34:53.879
Links should navigate to other pages,

00:34:53.880 --> 00:34:56.819
while buttons should perform functions.

00:34:56.820 --> 00:35:01.422
Use buttons for sliders, tabs,
or single-page applications.

00:35:07.720 --> 00:35:09.786
Hiding target by default.

00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:13.199
Many times the target appears
when it's hovered.

00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:17.399
In other cases, the target is hidden
by a fixed-position element.

00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:21.879
If targets are hidden,
write a token to instruct developers

00:35:21.880 --> 00:35:25.926
that it should be visible
in case of hover or focus.

00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:34.079
This was a very brief overview.

00:35:34.080 --> 00:35:36.890
40 minutes just isn't enough time.

00:35:38.080 --> 00:35:40.859
We got to the last poll.

00:35:46.120 --> 00:35:51.599
Based on our experience,
arrange the following web accessibility

00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:54.720
challenges in order to difficulty.

00:35:57.200 --> 00:36:02.840
I'm very curious what you are telling
us and voting.

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:09.839
I would say that
differentiation between links

00:36:09.840 --> 00:36:13.807
and tags are probably the most easier
part of this,

00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:18.366
but I don't want to predict anything.

00:36:26.120 --> 00:36:31.800
I think that creating an accessible color
palette is quite challenging.

00:36:39.040 --> 00:36:42.400
Maybe don't rely on color alone.

00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:44.279
I think it's not too difficult,

00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:48.564
but maybe some other people
think it's quite difficult.

00:36:51.739 --> 00:36:55.060
We have only two participants.

00:36:56.040 --> 00:36:57.600
Getting back.

00:37:01.519 --> 00:37:06.440
Adding a stop to
an infinitely moving object.

00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:12.380
This is difficult

00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:18.119
because it's an additional design element,

00:37:18.120 --> 00:37:23.960
and you can somehow
arrange it into your design.

00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:30.239
I would say the future is that using
user preferences everywhere,

00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:35.493
so if operation systems and browsers

00:37:36.196 --> 00:37:39.191
will be compatible with accessibility,

00:37:39.192 --> 00:37:44.599
you set your user preference
that don't move any moving object,

00:37:44.600 --> 00:37:48.399
and the website will apply it.

00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:51.480
I think this is the future, not now.

00:37:57.360 --> 00:38:01.177
Sorry, I think our time is short.

00:38:01.178 --> 00:38:03.657
We started a little bit later.

00:38:04.640 --> 00:38:06.862
Don't rely on color alone.

00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:11.319
I think this is one of the most important,

00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:15.049
but many people think
that it's quite difficult.

00:38:20.943 --> 00:38:25.259
While you voting,

00:38:27.220 --> 00:38:31.800
I'm trying to summarize everything.

00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:34.539
If you already have a website

00:38:34.540 --> 00:38:37.839
and you are thinking
about making accessible,

00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:41.639
you might want to think about
whether you will need to redesign.

00:38:41.640 --> 00:38:44.119
A brand-new concept
might cost a little bit more,

00:38:44.120 --> 00:38:48.008
but it will give
you a real competitive advantage.

00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:50.519
I know it would be great if a cheap plugin

00:38:50.520 --> 00:38:53.852
could make all
the changes to be inclusive.

00:38:54.680 --> 00:38:58.559
I'm not here to explain
why accessibility overlays don't work,

00:38:58.560 --> 00:38:59.919
but I just wanted to say

00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:03.279
that this can't make your website
much better.

00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:07.040
They don't fix things like consistency,

00:39:07.098 --> 00:39:12.160
clear language, or good typography,
or semantic structure.

00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:29.279
Keep accessibility in mind
when you are designing,

00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:32.295
maintaining, or remediating a website.

00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:37.359
This means recognizing
that different users have different needs.

00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:39.759
That's why it's so great that modern web

00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:43.960
technology can include
most of the trendy elements.

00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:47.612
It's important to use
them in a soulful way

00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:50.733
and follow the specific guidelines.

00:39:53.480 --> 00:39:55.463
Here are some resources.

00:39:57.600 --> 00:40:02.959
Smashing Magazine,
and there are very good UX magazines

00:40:02.960 --> 00:40:05.191
dealing with accessibility.

00:40:05.400 --> 00:40:10.180
Understanding success
criteria is a part of a WCAG,

00:40:10.920 --> 00:40:16.580
and each criteria
has understanding section

00:40:17.540 --> 00:40:23.160
with resources, detailed explanations,
examples, and best cases.

00:40:23.586 --> 00:40:28.200
Deque University's comprehensive
learning materials.

00:40:31.280 --> 00:40:36.039
There's other courses on how to design
for accessibility for UX designers.

00:40:36.040 --> 00:40:40.319
I've reviewed many courses,
and I think this is the best.

00:40:40.320 --> 00:40:45.079
Figma, OneGage,
we don't have experience with Figma.

00:40:45.080 --> 00:40:46.879
We don't have experience with OneGage.

00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:50.120
If you have, please let me know.

00:40:51.360 --> 00:40:53.619
Today, Johnny Albert will present

00:40:53.620 --> 00:40:58.279
the inclusive design strategies
for WordPress professionals.

00:40:58.280 --> 00:41:00.459
The last year's Carrie Fisher

00:41:00.460 --> 00:41:03.079
and Jonathan Whiting has
a very good presentation

00:41:03.080 --> 00:41:05.040
about this topic.

00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:09.040
Takeaways very shortly.

00:41:09.160 --> 00:41:15.240
Make accessibility a core part
of your project and don't rely on plugins.

00:41:15.460 --> 00:41:20.720
Two, understand that users
have a wide range of abilities.

00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:24.719
Three, bring in experts
to train your designers

00:41:24.720 --> 00:41:27.117
and give them the best tools.

00:41:28.229 --> 00:41:32.593
Four, if you don't have enough knowledge,
ask an expert.

00:41:33.440 --> 00:41:39.319
I believe that true
accessibility isn't just a quick fix.

00:41:39.320 --> 00:41:42.479
It's a commitment to a thoughtful
and inclusive design.

00:41:42.480 --> 00:41:47.479
It may require more effort upfront,
but the rewards are unmeasurable.

00:41:47.480 --> 00:41:50.759
By creating websites
that everyone can use,

00:41:50.760 --> 00:41:53.119
we are not merely
just following guidelines,

00:41:53.120 --> 00:41:56.240
but building a better web for everyone.

00:41:56.480 --> 00:41:59.259
Thank you for your time,
and thanks to my colleagues

00:41:59.260 --> 00:42:01.799
who helped me
to prepare this presentation.

00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:04.520
I will take questions now.

00:42:08.040 --> 00:42:11.559
<v Kelly> Thank you,
Zsolt for that great explanation

00:42:11.560 --> 00:42:14.879
of the basics of accessible web design.

00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:18.600
We have a question in the Q&amp;A.

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:23.639
The question is,
what is one of the most difficult design

00:42:23.640 --> 00:42:28.638
requests you had to make accessible,
and what was your approach?

00:42:32.280 --> 00:42:33.679
<v Zsolt> That's a good question.

00:42:33.680 --> 00:42:36.077
Let's go back to the polling.

00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:42.779
For us, the color part
was the most difficult

00:42:42.833 --> 00:42:49.833
because when we start
to create a new website,

00:42:50.580 --> 00:42:57.559
the designers want very specific colors,

00:42:57.560 --> 00:43:00.959
and it's very difficult to find
those colors

00:43:00.960 --> 00:43:05.320
which have a good contrast
ratio to each other.

00:43:07.440 --> 00:43:09.239
That was the most difficult part.

00:43:09.240 --> 00:43:12.652
I think the other thing
is much more easier.

00:43:15.600 --> 00:43:17.040
Is it okay?

00:43:17.760 --> 00:43:18.851
<v Kelly> Yes.

00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:25.299
Our next question is,
do you have accessible websites

00:43:25.300 --> 00:43:30.319
that you think have great design
that you could share as examples?

00:43:30.320 --> 00:43:34.366
Are there any brands
that you take inspiration from?

00:43:36.400 --> 00:43:38.301
<v Zsolt> Fortunately not.

00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:42.532
There are many good accessible web design.

00:43:48.240 --> 00:43:52.920
I would say that, for example,
in Hungary, I don't know.

00:43:53.627 --> 00:43:58.719
There are two webshops
which has a very accessible web design.

00:43:58.720 --> 00:44:03.900
One of them made
the accessibility redesign

00:44:04.380 --> 00:44:09.099
in five years' time, and after,

00:44:09.100 --> 00:44:13.479
it announced that three and a half times

00:44:13.480 --> 00:44:19.280
more users are buying

00:44:19.281 --> 00:44:21.029
from this webshop.

00:44:21.720 --> 00:44:25.079
I don't want to say
the name of this website,

00:44:25.080 --> 00:44:27.279
because it's an international company.

00:44:27.280 --> 00:44:32.360
It's a quite good webshop,
accessible, trendy, very good.

00:44:32.800 --> 00:44:38.520
I also like Google's accessibility.

00:44:39.800 --> 00:44:42.219
Most of the Google applications

00:44:42.220 --> 00:44:47.599
can be quite good design,

00:44:47.600 --> 00:44:50.280
and they are also accessible.

00:44:54.120 --> 00:44:57.770
<v Kelly> We have maybe
one or two questions here.

00:44:57.800 --> 00:45:02.119
The next one is,
if you have to do a major brand redesign,

00:45:02.120 --> 00:45:06.484
what element of accessibility
would you implement first,

00:45:06.520 --> 00:45:09.082
and what is the most important?

00:45:10.640 --> 00:45:14.686
<v Zsolt> Sorry to say,
but there is no most important.

00:45:17.160 --> 00:45:20.199
Accessibility is not
very difficult for me,

00:45:20.200 --> 00:45:22.499
but I think it's quite complex

00:45:22.500 --> 00:45:28.679
because we the experts can see

00:45:28.680 --> 00:45:34.559
that many different users
have many different abilities,

00:45:34.560 --> 00:45:38.280
and we are doing an accessible website.

00:45:38.892 --> 00:45:44.520
We can sync all of them, and we find
a solution which fits all of them.

00:45:44.782 --> 00:45:46.419
There is no most important

00:45:46.420 --> 00:45:52.359
because everyone is important.

00:45:52.360 --> 00:45:56.059
Maybe you can rank the most important

00:45:56.060 --> 00:45:59.399
as this is blocking for some people,

00:45:59.400 --> 00:46:02.039
and this is not blocking for some people.

00:46:02.040 --> 00:46:04.420
For example, if you have

00:46:05.780 --> 00:46:12.040
an unlabeled target, an unlabeled button,

00:46:12.600 --> 00:46:15.079
it can be blocking
for screen reader users,

00:46:15.080 --> 00:46:19.840
for many other people,
for voice recognition, software users.

00:46:19.880 --> 00:46:21.759
This is a blocking element.

00:46:21.760 --> 00:46:24.359
If you have a color contrast not enough,

00:46:24.360 --> 00:46:28.406
maybe a little bit less,
this is not a blocking one.

00:46:28.880 --> 00:46:35.780
I think accessibility is collecting
all of this information together

00:46:35.820 --> 00:46:39.960
and putting it into
the one trendy solution.

00:46:42.080 --> 00:46:42.939
<v Kelly> All right.

00:46:42.940 --> 00:46:45.759
