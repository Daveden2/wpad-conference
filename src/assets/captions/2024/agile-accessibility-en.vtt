Announcer:
WordPress Accessibility Day 2024.

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:05.990
Agile Accessibility:

00:00:06.291 --> 00:00:08.690
Building Inclusivity
into the Product Roadmap,

00:00:09.131 --> 00:00:12.088
with speaker Nasah Kuma,
front-end engineer.

00:00:12.947 --> 00:00:15.877
This presentation
was recorded October 2024.

00:00:16.768 --> 00:00:19.168
Laura Adamonis:
WordPress Accessibility Day 2024.

00:00:19.242 --> 00:00:22.012
My name is Laura
and I'm your MC for this talk.

00:00:22.722 --> 00:00:25.587
Thank you for joining us
for Agile Accessibility:

00:00:25.624 --> 00:00:31.026
Building Inclusivity
into the Product Roadmap with Nasah Kuma.

00:00:31.837 --> 00:00:36.090
Nasah is a front-end engineer
living in Cameroon.

00:00:36.509 --> 00:00:41.368
She has a degree in software engineering
and is very passionate about open-source

00:00:41.369 --> 00:00:43.710
and building accessible applications.

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:46.780
In her current role,

00:00:47.159 --> 00:00:50.038
she has spearheaded
several initiatives to improve

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.679
the accessibility
of their web applications,

00:00:53.099 --> 00:00:55.320
earning recognition from her peers

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.350
and leadership team.

00:00:57.089 --> 00:01:01.037
She is also an active contributor
in various open-source projects,

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.301
collaborating with developers
around the world

00:01:04.603 --> 00:01:07.080
to build innovative solutions.

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:08.820
Outside of her day job,

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.349
Nasah is studying to become an Agile coach

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:15.239
as she is deeply interested

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.658
in helping teams optimize their workflow

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.209
and deliver value more efficiently.

00:01:21.568 --> 00:01:25.079
She is excited to bring
these Agile methodologies

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:27.839
into her own work
and share them with others.

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.949
In her free time,
you can find her tinkering

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:32.428
with new technologies,

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:36.539
attending local tech meetups,
or volunteering at the community

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:37.840
coding events.

00:01:38.095 --> 00:01:41.595
She is also eager to learn and grow
both personally and professionally.

00:01:42.317 --> 00:01:47.159
Please feel free to add your questions
in the Zoom Q&amp;A section

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:50.040
at the bottom of your screen
and we'll answer them

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.370
at the end of the session.

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.210
Use the chat to connect
with other attendees.

00:01:54.599 --> 00:01:55.800
Please welcome Nasah.

00:01:59.609 --> 00:02:00.839
Nasah Kuma: Hello, everybody,

00:02:00.839 --> 00:02:03.919
and welcome to this talk
on Agile accessibility

00:02:04.529 --> 00:02:08.880
where we will be discussing building
inclusivity into the product roadmap.

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.189
As Laura already introduced,
thank you very much Laura

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:14.789
for the wonderful introduction.

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.759
I am Nasah and I'm joining you today
from Cameroon.

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:26.729
If you are new to the term accessibility,
accessibility in our context is

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:32.189
about making sure that all users,
including those with disabilities

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:33.809
can use our applications.

00:02:34.469 --> 00:02:37.878
To incorporate accessibility
in product development,

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:41.290
we need to first understand
accessibility guidelines

00:02:41.537 --> 00:02:44.609
and standards that will help us
when guiding our requirements

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:45.940
and during implementation.

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:55.452
Some of our learning outcomes
or objectives for this talk include WCAG,

00:02:56.242 --> 00:02:59.142
inclusivity,
inclusive product roadmapping,

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:00.529
some Agile terms,

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:04.769
and then integrating accessibility
into Agile practices.

00:03:05.639 --> 00:03:09.840
This talk is a beginner level talk
and I will try my best to define

00:03:09.869 --> 00:03:12.882
all the technical terms related
to accessibility and Agile

00:03:13.192 --> 00:03:14.790
that I will be using.

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:16.953
By the end of this talk,

00:03:16.954 --> 00:03:19.404
I hope that you should
have learned a thing or two

00:03:19.546 --> 00:03:22.409
about accessibility
if you're new to the topic

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:27.870
or about Agile just to help you to work
in the teams that you find yourselves.

00:03:31.344 --> 00:03:36.420
Since we are here for the web,
I would like us to focus

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:39.420
on the web content accessibility
guidelines,

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.180
which you commonly
come across as WCAG.

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:47.828
Over time, there
have been different versions of WCAG.

00:03:48.468 --> 00:03:52.139
From 2.0 we moved
to 2.1 and now we are at 2.2.

00:03:52.608 --> 00:03:58.282
WCAG 2.2 extends WCAG 2.1,
which was published

00:03:58.333 --> 00:04:03.896
as a W3C recommendation in June 2018.

00:04:05.039 --> 00:04:13.066
Content that conforms to WCAG 2.2
also conforms to WCAG 2.0

00:04:13.151 --> 00:04:15.056
and WCAG 2.1,

00:04:15.136 --> 00:04:19.857
so it is safe for us to center
our conversations in WCAG 2.2.

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:26.021
WCAG 2.2 is a set of guidelines created
by the World Wide Web Consortium, W3C,

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:27.200
as earlier mentioned,

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.782
to help make web content more accessible

00:04:29.811 --> 00:04:32.161
for people with disabilities.

00:04:33.032 --> 00:04:38.303
These guidelines contain recommendations
for designing and coding websites.

00:04:39.243 --> 00:04:42.924
WCAG 2.2 covers a wide range
of recommendations

00:04:42.954 --> 00:04:45.554
for making web content more accessible.

00:04:46.457 --> 00:04:47.857
Following these guidelines

00:04:47.887 --> 00:04:50.212
will help you make
more content accessible

00:04:50.213 --> 00:04:52.723
to a wider range of people
with disabilities,

00:04:52.773 --> 00:04:54.673
including accommodations for blindness

00:04:55.053 --> 00:04:57.183
and low vision,
deafness and hearing loss,

00:04:57.483 --> 00:05:00.735
limited movement,
speech disabilities,

00:05:00.765 --> 00:05:03.217
photosensitivity,
and combinations

00:05:03.247 --> 00:05:06.247
of these and probably accommodations

00:05:06.277 --> 00:05:08.827
for learning disabilities
and cognitive limitations,

00:05:09.285 --> 00:05:10.285
but of course,

00:05:10.306 --> 00:05:14.685
it is not going to address every user need
for people with disabilities.

00:05:15.886 --> 00:05:20.354
These guidelines address accessibility
for web content on desktops,

00:05:20.355 --> 00:05:22.845
laptops, tablets, and mobile devices.

00:05:23.464 --> 00:05:26.614
Following these guidelines
will also often help make web content

00:05:26.625 --> 00:05:29.626
more accessible to users in general.

00:05:34.636 --> 00:05:39.076
The key principles [?] of the principles
of WCAG 2.2 are perceivable,

00:05:39.436 --> 00:05:41.566
operable, understandable, and robust.

00:05:44.046 --> 00:05:47.295
By perceivable,
we just mean that information

00:05:47.356 --> 00:05:50.925
and user interface components
must be presentable to users

00:05:51.435 --> 00:05:53.117
in ways that they can perceive.

00:05:53.118 --> 00:05:54.118
An example

00:05:54.705 --> 00:05:59.505
is always to make sure to provide
authentic text for any non-text content

00:05:59.895 --> 00:06:06.644
so that it can be changed into other forms
for people who need it [?]

00:06:06.804 --> 00:06:13.408
also want to play a large screen [?]
symbols or simple language.

00:06:14.508 --> 00:06:18.255
Operable means that all users
should be able to operate the interface.

00:06:18.796 --> 00:06:22.425
In that light, it is essential
to make all functionality available

00:06:22.426 --> 00:06:23.426
from the keyboard.

00:06:24.375 --> 00:06:29.892
Understandable means that web content
must be presented in a way that is easy

00:06:29.952 --> 00:06:31.362
to understand to all users,

00:06:32.085 --> 00:06:35.206
including users with cognitive
and learning disabilities.

00:06:36.466 --> 00:06:37.815
As a recommendation,

00:06:37.816 --> 00:06:40.966
text has to be readable
and understandable for everybody.

00:06:42.603 --> 00:06:45.153
Robust means
that the content must be compatible

00:06:45.184 --> 00:06:49.600
with current and future user agents,
including assistive technologies.

00:06:50.465 --> 00:06:52.906
Applications
should maximize compatibility.

00:06:53.976 --> 00:06:56.574
There's a lot about WCAG 2.2
and WCAG as a whole,

00:06:56.595 --> 00:06:59.025
and you can always read more about it

00:06:59.646 --> 00:07:03.722
to just help you know the success criteria
and the guidelines to follow

00:07:03.772 --> 00:07:06.072
depending on the application
you're working on.

00:07:08.133 --> 00:07:12.616
Agile plus Accessibility,
the Ultimate Intersection.

00:07:13.525 --> 00:07:14.695
If you've been following

00:07:14.695 --> 00:07:18.375
the evolution of software
development methodologies,

00:07:18.465 --> 00:07:21.305
you know that most,
if not all, software products,

00:07:21.385 --> 00:07:24.598
including websites today are developed
following the Agile methodology,

00:07:24.598 --> 00:07:28.275
which emphasizes
collaboration and improvement and is

00:07:28.276 --> 00:07:31.677
based on a set of values and principles
that prioritize adaptability

00:07:32.097 --> 00:07:35.146
and flexibility over following a plan.

00:07:35.823 --> 00:07:39.673
Before getting here, people struggled
with traditional methods of development,

00:07:40.096 --> 00:07:44.775
which made it very difficult
to build inclusive applications.

00:07:46.508 --> 00:07:50.092
Agile, on the other hand,
because of its iterative nature

00:07:50.596 --> 00:07:55.035
and its focus on delivering value,
makes it a good candidate to incorporate

00:07:55.036 --> 00:07:57.226
accessibility in development practices.

00:07:58.415 --> 00:08:01.868
Why then do most creators
of applications still not include

00:08:01.898 --> 00:08:03.698
accessibility requirements?

00:08:03.996 --> 00:08:06.446
Well, in my case,
I would say that I was ignorant,

00:08:06.796 --> 00:08:10.845
but I'm glad that now I make the effort
to create and to build inclusively.

00:08:12.466 --> 00:08:15.374
Accessibility can be included
at any point in development,

00:08:15.375 --> 00:08:19.666
but it will be better and easier
to have it in mind from the start

00:08:20.566 --> 00:08:23.385
because this
is more cost effective.

00:08:23.815 --> 00:08:27.615
Early integrations allows
for user testing with diverse groups,

00:08:27.851 --> 00:08:30.705
giving you valuable feedback
that can improve the product

00:08:30.709 --> 00:08:31.709
before launch.

00:08:32.205 --> 00:08:33.225
If you're thinking,

00:08:33.585 --> 00:08:36.015
"Oh, I can start building
my application now

00:08:36.195 --> 00:08:40.725
and I'll include accessibility later,"
please think again.

00:08:44.476 --> 00:08:49.935
This talk is on Agile accessibility,
not only because Agile development

00:08:49.936 --> 00:08:55.006
has proven to have many advantages
over other methods of development,

00:08:55.266 --> 00:08:58.300
but because it is easier
to include accessibility in Agile.

00:08:58.875 --> 00:08:59.875
Why is it easier?

00:09:00.264 --> 00:09:03.255
First of all, Agile
promotes iterative cycles,

00:09:03.585 --> 00:09:07.236
otherwise known as sprints/
We'll talk about sprints in future slides.

00:09:07.436 --> 00:09:09.586
Allowing teams
to gather feedback regularly.

00:09:10.177 --> 00:09:12.577
This means accessibility issues
can be identified

00:09:12.767 --> 00:09:15.747
and addressed continuously
throughout development process,

00:09:16.436 --> 00:09:19.846
rather than at the end
of a very lengthy project timeline

00:09:19.847 --> 00:09:22.616
as is in the case
with most traditional methods

00:09:22.646 --> 00:09:23.646
of development.

00:09:24.646 --> 00:09:28.995
Also, Agile encourages collaboration
among diverse team members,

00:09:29.716 --> 00:09:30.945
including designers,

00:09:30.946 --> 00:09:33.524
developers, testers,
accessibility experts,

00:09:33.525 --> 00:09:35.625
and every other person
that is in the team.

00:09:35.926 --> 00:09:38.606
This collaborative environment fosters

00:09:38.686 --> 00:09:41.046
a shared understanding
of accessibility [?]

00:09:41.556 --> 00:09:47.931
ensures that all perspectives
are considered from the start.

00:09:49.006 --> 00:09:50.006
Also,

00:09:50.296 --> 00:09:52.756
Agile emphasizes
the involvement of the user,

00:09:53.176 --> 00:09:55.479
including those with disabilities,
of course.

00:09:55.689 --> 00:10:01.755
Regular usability testing sessions
with users allows teams to observe

00:10:01.755 --> 00:10:06.106
how people interact with the product,
leading to more informed decisions

00:10:06.135 --> 00:10:09.034
regarding accessibility features
and inputs.

00:10:10.214 --> 00:10:12.816
Of course, there's a flexibility to adapt

00:10:14.006 --> 00:10:16.216
to changing requirements,
which allows teams

00:10:16.276 --> 00:10:20.500
to prioritize accessibility enhancements
as new insights are gained

00:10:20.736 --> 00:10:22.896
or as users' needs evolve,

00:10:23.796 --> 00:10:27.815
ensuring that accessibility remains
a core focus rather than something

00:10:27.816 --> 00:10:29.904
that we just think about later on.

00:10:33.472 --> 00:10:37.584
Let's just talk about
the product roadmap a little bit.

00:10:39.234 --> 00:10:43.174
We cannot really talk Agile
without a solid product vision

00:10:43.264 --> 00:10:47.045
and a roadmap to outline
the journey for developing a product.

00:10:47.645 --> 00:10:50.916
While the vision covers
who and what the product is for,

00:10:51.407 --> 00:10:54.265
the roadmap is a high-level plan
which outlines the journey

00:10:54.265 --> 00:10:55.465
for product development.

00:10:56.105 --> 00:11:00.265
It communicates future releases
and when features can be expected.

00:11:00.386 --> 00:11:03.526
It's usually divided into phases,
which could be monthly,

00:11:03.846 --> 00:11:06.006
quarterly, or by release.

00:11:06.556 --> 00:11:09.286
From my image,
you see that our phases are monthly.

00:11:11.847 --> 00:11:14.675
We have from January to July.

00:11:14.976 --> 00:11:17.138
We have different features
that we're working on.

00:11:17.138 --> 00:11:19.955
We have features
that are related to enhancement.

00:11:19.956 --> 00:11:21.994
We have mobile-related features.

00:11:21.995 --> 00:11:26.165
We have data quality-related features
and things that concern automation.

00:11:26.646 --> 00:11:31.657
All of this we'll be doing throughout
the number of months

00:11:31.658 --> 00:11:33.408
that we have displayed on the image.

00:11:33.408 --> 00:11:35.788
This is just an example
of how a product roadmap

00:11:35.818 --> 00:11:36.818
may look like.

00:11:37.172 --> 00:11:40.745
It changes depending on the application
that we're building and depending

00:11:40.745 --> 00:11:43.326
on when we start development.

00:11:45.865 --> 00:11:48.964
In our discussion on building
inclusive product roadmaps,

00:11:48.965 --> 00:11:52.355
we will focus on developing
inclusive user stories,

00:11:52.675 --> 00:11:57.649
including accessibility
in retrospectives and sprints.

00:11:59.786 --> 00:12:00.816
It's story time.

00:12:01.786 --> 00:12:04.736
About four years ago,
when I left university,

00:12:04.787 --> 00:12:07.987
the first application
I worked on was a job portal.

00:12:09.846 --> 00:12:12.636
The team had decided
to use the Agile method.

00:12:13.566 --> 00:12:16.966
I was excited to be part of this team,
looking forward to fitting in,

00:12:17.316 --> 00:12:19.566
contributing,
and learning as much as I could.

00:12:20.466 --> 00:12:24.046
When work started, as is normal [?]

00:12:24.965 --> 00:12:26.165
any newly formed team,

00:12:26.586 --> 00:12:29.494
we got caught up in coding
and the application,

00:12:29.495 --> 00:12:31.395
and we forgot about every other thing.

00:12:31.695 --> 00:12:37.374
We neglected our stand-ups,
our meetings, our retrospectives.

00:12:37.962 --> 00:12:40.716
When we presented
what we had been working on

00:12:41.646 --> 00:12:46.745
for the time when we spent working,
it was clear that something

00:12:46.746 --> 00:12:48.546
was terribly wrong.

00:12:50.575 --> 00:12:54.050
When organizations and teams
experience Agile transformation,

00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:58.595
it is normal for them to experience
what my team from four years

00:12:58.596 --> 00:12:59.976
back experienced.

00:13:00.815 --> 00:13:02.256
In this same light,

00:13:02.465 --> 00:13:05.125
successfully adopting
Agile accessibility in teams,

00:13:05.175 --> 00:13:06.175
organizations,

00:13:06.435 --> 00:13:08.705
will require a large amount
of change in behavior

00:13:08.705 --> 00:13:09.705
from everyone.

00:13:10.182 --> 00:13:12.653
To successfully do this,
the Agile accessibility

00:13:12.703 --> 00:13:14.075
transformation process

00:13:14.466 --> 00:13:15.815
will need to be managed.

00:13:16.658 --> 00:13:20.316
Missing skills and knowledge
will have to be brought in,

00:13:20.826 --> 00:13:24.605
and teams will have to be supported
as they go through the process.

00:13:26.525 --> 00:13:30.756
Regardless of your role in the team,
there's always something you can do.

00:13:31.376 --> 00:13:33.035
You should not think or say that,

00:13:33.036 --> 00:13:38.275
"Oh, I'm not the product owner,"
or, "I'm not the facilitator,"

00:13:38.325 --> 00:13:41.805
or, "I'm not the accessibility coach.
What can I do?"

00:13:42.325 --> 00:13:43.785
Even as a normal team member,

00:13:43.815 --> 00:13:46.814
there's a lot that you can do
just by reading the guidelines

00:13:46.815 --> 00:13:48.984
and trying to think
about everyone when building

00:13:48.984 --> 00:13:50.134
and when designing.

00:13:52.085 --> 00:13:53.085
Let's use

00:13:54.005 --> 00:13:58.179
this job portal application as an example
and look at how to integrate accessibility

00:13:58.239 --> 00:13:59.796
into some Agile practices.

00:14:03.296 --> 00:14:06.786
Like I already mentioned
in previous slides,

00:14:07.175 --> 00:14:12.155
a good product vision tells us
what the product is attempting to achieve

00:14:12.546 --> 00:14:14.875
and who will benefit from this product.

00:14:15.696 --> 00:14:16.746
In our case,

00:14:18.005 --> 00:14:22.820
our product, the job portal,
aims to connect job seekers

00:14:22.950 --> 00:14:24.400
with meaningful opportunities

00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:27.515
and empower employers
to find the right talent,

00:14:28.025 --> 00:14:30.785
fostering a diverse
and thriving workforce.

00:14:32.234 --> 00:14:36.504
From this statement, from this vision,
you see that it covers

00:14:36.555 --> 00:14:38.016
all the important parts.

00:14:38.405 --> 00:14:42.155
We can see clearly who the product
is for and what they will achieve,

00:14:42.626 --> 00:14:44.726
what they will gain
from using the product.

00:14:45.125 --> 00:14:47.735
Let's see how we can include accessibility

00:14:48.425 --> 00:14:50.975
to better achieve this vision.

00:14:54.113 --> 00:14:57.319
Normally,
before building any application,

00:14:57.320 --> 00:15:00.300
you have to do some requirement gathering.

00:15:01.196 --> 00:15:05.135
Because we're talking accessibility,
it will be important that we look

00:15:05.136 --> 00:15:07.355
at some methods that we can also use to,

00:15:08.076 --> 00:15:09.365
when gathering

00:15:10.055 --> 00:15:12.705
our requirements,
also gather accessible requirements.

00:15:14.671 --> 00:15:18.061
One thing that we can do is
to carry out one-on-one interviews

00:15:18.091 --> 00:15:19.266
with users,

00:15:19.825 --> 00:15:23.314
particularly those with disabilities,
to help us to develop

00:15:23.315 --> 00:15:24.465
inclusive requirements.

00:15:24.625 --> 00:15:27.575
During these reviews,
we can ask open-ended questions

00:15:28.205 --> 00:15:31.144
to understand their needs, challenges,
and preferences

00:15:31.145 --> 00:15:32.825
regarding accessibility features.

00:15:33.945 --> 00:15:35.645
Another thing is our personas.

00:15:35.705 --> 00:15:39.116
We have to design to have
accessibility personas

00:15:39.486 --> 00:15:42.069
that represent users
with different disabilities

00:15:42.359 --> 00:15:42.786
and accessibility needs.

00:15:42.786 --> 00:15:46.145
We have to ensure that these personas
are as detailed as possible.

00:15:47.915 --> 00:15:51.995
Also, organizing focus groups that include
a diverse range of participants,

00:15:52.415 --> 00:15:54.156
including people
with various disabilities,

00:15:54.156 --> 00:15:55.505
can really help.

00:15:56.345 --> 00:15:59.885
We can facilitate discussions
around their experiences,

00:16:00.092 --> 00:16:03.842
their existing products, and also gather
insights on potential improvements.

00:16:04.706 --> 00:16:06.574
Also, surveys and questionnaires.

00:16:06.575 --> 00:16:07.575
Very important,

00:16:07.895 --> 00:16:11.195
but when we create them
for people with disabilities,

00:16:11.255 --> 00:16:12.275
let's also remember

00:16:12.785 --> 00:16:16.146
to create surveys and questionnaires
that are accessible.

00:16:18.831 --> 00:16:21.635
Usability testing, of course.

00:16:21.665 --> 00:16:27.002
We should have sessions with users
with disabilities where they can test

00:16:27.212 --> 00:16:29.298
and interact with prototypes
of existing products,

00:16:29.298 --> 00:16:32.152
and we should really observe
how they interact with these products

00:16:32.152 --> 00:16:35.045
so that we can note
any accessibility issues

00:16:35.046 --> 00:16:39.335
that they encounter so we can use
all of this information to improve

00:16:39.695 --> 00:16:42.935
on the application or to build
something that will be very,

00:16:42.936 --> 00:16:44.195
very usable to everybody.

00:16:48.266 --> 00:16:52.205
Let's assume that after gathering
our requirements

00:16:52.206 --> 00:16:54.500
and with input from top
management, we

00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:58.770
have these features
for our minimum viable products.

00:16:58.790 --> 00:17:02.016
We have user registration
and profile creation,

00:17:02.616 --> 00:17:03.616
job search,

00:17:03.786 --> 00:17:04.806
job listings,

00:17:05.296 --> 00:17:06.296
job posting,

00:17:06.346 --> 00:17:09.875
and we have to work
on an administrator dashboard.

00:17:12.263 --> 00:17:17.579
A high-level plan or the product roadmap
may look something like this,

00:17:18.519 --> 00:17:19.769
divided into four phases.

00:17:19.769 --> 00:17:23.978
For Phase 1, we'll be working
on user registration and profile creation,

00:17:24.325 --> 00:17:27.325
for Phase 2, we'll be developing
the administrator dashboard,

00:17:27.771 --> 00:17:31.967
Phase 3, we'll be working
on job listing and job posting features,

00:17:32.367 --> 00:17:35.495
and for Phase 4, we're going
to work on job search.

00:17:42.095 --> 00:17:44.436
Of course, we need a fabulous team

00:17:45.116 --> 00:17:46.205
to do all of this.

00:17:46.366 --> 00:17:48.685
I decided to call this team,
Team Dream,

00:17:48.975 --> 00:17:51.475
because they're going
to give us our dream product.

00:17:52.885 --> 00:17:55.714
I would love for all of us
attending this session

00:17:55.715 --> 00:18:00.417
to imagine being part of this team
and thinking of one of the rules

00:18:00.468 --> 00:18:01.818
that we'll discuss shortly.

00:18:02.328 --> 00:18:05.478
Think of how you can support
the accessibility goals of the team

00:18:05.786 --> 00:18:06.996
as an Agile member.

00:18:07.466 --> 00:18:11.066
I already picked a role for myself,
and I'll be working as a facilitator.

00:18:11.462 --> 00:18:14.232
No worries, there can be more
than one facilitator.

00:18:15.702 --> 00:18:16.702
It's okay.

00:18:17.195 --> 00:18:19.342
In a typical Agile team,

00:18:20.196 --> 00:18:23.295
and of course in Team Dream,
we have a product owner

00:18:23.375 --> 00:18:26.615
who is the voice of the customer.

00:18:27.226 --> 00:18:30.516
The product owner is responsible
for working with the Agile team,

00:18:30.575 --> 00:18:32.025
as well as the business,

00:18:32.075 --> 00:18:34.205
to maximize the value of the product.

00:18:34.952 --> 00:18:39.103
The product owner also prioritizes
and manages the product backlog,

00:18:39.313 --> 00:18:42.363
which is where user stories
and features are generally listed.

00:18:43.443 --> 00:18:46.813
We have a facilitator who serves
as the Agile coach

00:18:47.283 --> 00:18:50.283
and supports
the team to achieve its goals.

00:18:56.104 --> 00:18:58.928
The facilitator also keeps the team,
the Agile team,

00:18:59.248 --> 00:19:01.565
moving towards business objectives.

00:19:02.078 --> 00:19:04.628
The team always has to be
in line and their facilitator

00:19:04.628 --> 00:19:07.716
is there to make sure
that the team stays on point.

00:19:09.026 --> 00:19:13.834
The facilitator also removes blockages
experienced by the team or members

00:19:13.835 --> 00:19:14.875
individually.

00:19:15.995 --> 00:19:20.075
Then we have the Agile team,
which is made up of developers,

00:19:20.076 --> 00:19:23.437
designers, data scientists,
security experts,

00:19:23.473 --> 00:19:27.980
testers, and all necessary
for a great product.

00:19:28.895 --> 00:19:31.895
This team is responsible
for delivering the shippable product

00:19:32.195 --> 00:19:34.266
after every sprint

00:19:34.806 --> 00:19:35.945
or every iteration.

00:19:38.395 --> 00:19:46.735
Since we are talking about
increasing accessibility,

00:19:47.155 --> 00:19:49.395
we also [?] our accessibility goals.

00:19:50.616 --> 00:19:54.126
The coach directs the team
to achieve its accessibility goals

00:19:54.206 --> 00:19:59.316
and they can do so by conducting
training sessions to educate team members

00:19:59.766 --> 00:20:01.985
about accessibility principles,
guidelines,

00:20:01.986 --> 00:20:03.276
and best practices.

00:20:03.631 --> 00:20:05.847
They provide expert advice
during the design

00:20:05.879 --> 00:20:07.634
and development phases

00:20:07.646 --> 00:20:08.646
to ensure

00:20:09.126 --> 00:20:11.656
accessibility is integrated
from the start,

00:20:12.696 --> 00:20:16.396
and they promote an inclusive culture
within the team and the organization,

00:20:16.936 --> 00:20:18.496
because we cannot be building

00:20:19.365 --> 00:20:23.149
with accessibility in mind
and as a team we are not inclusive

00:20:23.729 --> 00:20:24.979
in the things that we do.

00:20:29.775 --> 00:20:32.925
Since we are being Agile,
we will have meetings

00:20:32.985 --> 00:20:34.875
before and after sprints.

00:20:36.406 --> 00:20:41.385
A sprint is really just
a short defined period of time when a team

00:20:41.386 --> 00:20:43.600
works on specific tasks to achieve goals.

00:20:43.710 --> 00:20:46.875
Sprints are generally two
to four weeks long.

00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:51.825
The sprint planning meeting is held
to discuss about the set of features

00:20:52.156 --> 00:20:55.569
to be delivered for the sprint
as well as user stories.

00:20:56.599 --> 00:20:58.396
During this planning meeting,

00:20:58.936 --> 00:21:00.556
team members can brainstorm

00:21:01.145 --> 00:21:04.345
the accessibility impacts of the stories
that are being proposed,

00:21:04.666 --> 00:21:07.665
and they can also identify
complex interactions or functionalities

00:21:07.665 --> 00:21:11.531
that may require
additional research or extra skills.

00:21:12.585 --> 00:21:15.435
It's important that during these meetings,
team members should think

00:21:15.435 --> 00:21:18.295
about the impact of accessibility
on these three points

00:21:18.735 --> 00:21:21.346
and the team's overall speed or velocity.

00:21:22.156 --> 00:21:27.039
Some accessibility features
may be pushed forward

00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:31.184
to help the team maintain its pace,
or other features may be replaced

00:21:31.185 --> 00:21:36.285
with accessibility features if the team
sees that they are of higher priority.

00:21:37.305 --> 00:21:39.255
Speaker 3: Excuse me one second, Nasah.

00:21:39.921 --> 00:21:40.921
Nasah: Yes.

00:21:41.025 --> 00:21:43.635
Speaker 3: Can we ask you
to try turning off your video

00:21:43.635 --> 00:21:45.525
just to improve the audio quality?

00:21:45.615 --> 00:21:48.825
The captioners are having
a lot of difficulty with dropped audio.

00:21:50.806 --> 00:21:51.806
Nasah: Okay.

00:21:52.674 --> 00:21:54.660
Speaker 3: We'll still see your slides.

00:21:54.661 --> 00:21:58.111
We just want to try and turn off the video
to decrease your bandwidth.

00:21:58.595 --> 00:22:00.615
Nasah: Okay. Is that okay?

00:22:01.185 --> 00:22:02.585
Speaker 3: Yes, that's fine.

00:22:02.705 --> 00:22:03.495
Nasah: All right.
Sorry about that.

00:22:03.495 --> 00:22:04.795
Speaker 3: I can hear you
more clearly now.

00:22:04.795 --> 00:22:06.145
No, that's quite all right.

00:22:06.706 --> 00:22:07.706
Thanks a lot.

00:22:10.496 --> 00:22:12.696
Nasah: Like I was saying,
for our Dream Team,

00:22:14.955 --> 00:22:19.420
during the first planning meeting,
we will plan on how to accomplish

00:22:19.450 --> 00:22:22.110
the first phase of our delivery,
which is implementing

00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:25.123
the user registration
and profile management feature.

00:22:25.660 --> 00:22:28.636
Since the assumption is
that the team is freshly formed,

00:22:29.145 --> 00:22:31.095
the Agile team members may not have

00:22:31.725 --> 00:22:35.776
much to say about the user stories
and their acceptance criteria.

00:22:37.275 --> 00:22:39.765
Normally, or as expected,
the product owner

00:22:40.636 --> 00:22:41.838
would develop the stories

00:22:41.838 --> 00:22:44.940
and can use the opportunity
to remind the team

00:22:45.020 --> 00:22:48.754
on the structure of these stories
and also how to come up

00:22:48.804 --> 00:22:50.506
with good acceptance criteria.

00:22:51.635 --> 00:22:53.785
Let's not forget
that when the team matures,

00:22:54.315 --> 00:22:57.494
every member is advised
to contribute as much as possible

00:22:57.495 --> 00:23:01.154
to the development of user stories,
acceptance criteria,

00:23:01.155 --> 00:23:04.336
and prioritization of the work
that has to be done.

00:23:09.761 --> 00:23:13.875
For our user registration feature,
we can have a story

00:23:14.895 --> 00:23:17.566
that looks like what we have on the slide.

00:23:18.375 --> 00:23:19.375
For example,

00:23:19.576 --> 00:23:21.046
as a new job seeker,

00:23:22.215 --> 00:23:26.324
I want to register using
my email or social media accounts

00:23:26.626 --> 00:23:29.026
so that I can quickly create an account.

00:23:30.466 --> 00:23:32.686
This story is simple
and straight to the point,

00:23:32.686 --> 00:23:36.554
and it serves its purpose of briefly
and informally describing

00:23:36.555 --> 00:23:40.326
a software feature or a function
from the perspective of the end user.

00:23:41.986 --> 00:23:46.905
However, whether this story is accessible
or not depends on its acceptance criteria.

00:23:50.257 --> 00:23:53.307
Acceptance criteria, for those of us
who are not familiar with the term,

00:23:53.307 --> 00:23:57.247
is the set of conditions that must be met
for the user stories

00:23:57.327 --> 00:23:58.756
to be considered complete.

00:24:00.515 --> 00:24:02.895
Normally, like in most cases,

00:24:03.406 --> 00:24:06.055
when people
don't think about accessibility,

00:24:06.365 --> 00:24:11.161
the acceptance criteria for a story like
this would be maybe users can register.

00:24:11.377 --> 00:24:14.752
After implementing this story,
what we will check is that users

00:24:14.753 --> 00:24:17.715
can register using an email address
or social media account.

00:24:17.946 --> 00:24:19.373
[?]

00:24:19.533 --> 00:24:21.753
The registration form includes all fields,

00:24:21.803 --> 00:24:23.163
maybe email, password.

00:24:23.213 --> 00:24:24.473
We say yes, everything is good.

00:24:24.473 --> 00:24:28.515
Then users receive a confirmation message
after successful registration.

00:24:30.036 --> 00:24:33.347
We see clearly
that this acceptance criteria leaves out

00:24:33.377 --> 00:24:35.084
a lot of users.

00:24:36.356 --> 00:24:41.176
Since we're thinking accessibility,
we could modify our acceptance criteria

00:24:41.205 --> 00:24:42.855
to look like this.

00:24:43.481 --> 00:24:46.413
Users can register using
email or social media

00:24:46.803 --> 00:24:49.606
with clear accessible labels.

00:24:50.375 --> 00:24:53.917
All input fields are navigable
via keyboard and compatible

00:24:53.975 --> 00:24:54.975
with screen readers.

00:25:11.017 --> 00:25:12.405
[?]

00:25:12.555 --> 00:25:13.605
I'm talking about.

00:25:14.625 --> 00:25:26.205
[?] accessible labels,

00:25:26.865 --> 00:25:32.326
we are making sure that our input fields
can be navigated using the keyboard

00:25:32.975 --> 00:25:35.384
and everything is compatible
with screen readers.

00:25:35.385 --> 00:25:40.905
We are also trying to send
our error messages out in a very,

00:25:40.906 --> 00:25:42.656
very simple and descriptive manner.

00:25:58.645 --> 00:26:03.046
Nasah: For the second part
of our user story,

00:26:06.350 --> 00:26:10.366
looking at the second user story option,

00:26:11.855 --> 00:26:13.545
we see that as a job seeker,

00:26:13.546 --> 00:26:17.175
I want to create a detailed profile
including work experience,

00:26:17.836 --> 00:26:18.915
education,

00:26:19.275 --> 00:26:20.275
skills,

00:26:21.465 --> 00:26:24.675
so that employers
can view my qualifications.

00:26:25.215 --> 00:26:26.215
Again,

00:26:29.805 --> 00:26:34.116
if we are just looking
at very simple stories

00:26:34.146 --> 00:26:35.546
that don't include everyone,

00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:37.881
the acceptance criteria
can be users can put

00:26:37.881 --> 00:26:40.674
their work experience,
education, and skills.

00:26:40.803 --> 00:26:43.385
Users can save their profile
without errors.

00:26:44.016 --> 00:26:47.120
Then the profile displays correctly
to employers after saving.

00:26:48.245 --> 00:26:51.905
This again, like I said,
does not include everybody.

00:26:52.425 --> 00:26:55.336
A set of criteria like all fields have

00:26:56.115 --> 00:27:00.766
accessible labels and form elements
are compatible with assistive technologies

00:27:01.306 --> 00:27:02.306
is good.

00:27:02.326 --> 00:27:15.047
Two tips or help texts are available
for complex fields presented

00:27:15.048 --> 00:27:16.827
in an accessible manner

00:27:17.355 --> 00:27:20.665
and validation messages are conveyed
through accessible palettes

00:27:20.715 --> 00:27:23.205
that are easy to understand.

00:27:23.565 --> 00:27:25.636
Again, this set of criteria

00:27:26.415 --> 00:27:30.376
tries to some extent to include
as many users as possible.

00:27:36.095 --> 00:27:37.188
During the sprints,

00:27:38.008 --> 00:27:39.738
during the development of our features

00:27:39.738 --> 00:27:42.287
and when work is being done,
there are also some things

00:27:42.287 --> 00:27:43.936
that we can do

00:27:44.865 --> 00:27:48.586
to make sure that we are developing
accessible features.

00:27:49.486 --> 00:27:51.706
In Agile, most Agile frameworks,

00:27:53.176 --> 00:27:55.876
and the most common of them,
maybe the Scrum framework,

00:27:56.775 --> 00:27:59.380
it's advised that there
should be daily meetings

00:27:59.381 --> 00:28:02.768
at the first stand-ups
that team members attend,

00:28:03.515 --> 00:28:06.365
where they will talk
about what they did the previous day,

00:28:06.855 --> 00:28:10.156
what they're going to do today,
and they share any challenges.

00:28:10.872 --> 00:28:15.282
These meetings can be a good opportunity
for team members to probably share

00:28:15.752 --> 00:28:19.503
with the accessibility challenges
that they face beyond a feature

00:28:19.504 --> 00:28:21.504
that they were working the previous day.

00:28:22.655 --> 00:28:24.845
Let's say they were not able
to complete it because of this

00:28:24.845 --> 00:28:25.996
and this challenge.

00:28:26.566 --> 00:28:30.226
Because the team has the opportunity
to meet every day face-to-face

00:28:30.496 --> 00:28:31.725
or even remotely,

00:28:32.106 --> 00:28:36.006
it's just the fact that they have
the opportunity to meet on daily basis.

00:28:36.366 --> 00:28:40.006
They can always look
at what is not going well.

00:28:40.183 --> 00:28:42.466
They can always talk
about the problems that they have,

00:28:42.466 --> 00:28:46.936
and they can always block out time
to try to fix these issues.

00:28:47.435 --> 00:28:50.764
During the sprints and during stand-ups,
members can still discuss

00:28:50.814 --> 00:28:53.364
about accessibility challenges
that they are having,

00:28:53.536 --> 00:28:56.111
and they see how they can work on it.

00:28:58.006 --> 00:29:01.245
There are some teams
that practice paired programming

00:29:03.425 --> 00:29:06.091
with the aim
of facilitating skill transfer,

00:29:06.124 --> 00:29:11.426
let's say that maybe there's
a team of very junior developers

00:29:11.476 --> 00:29:16.335
or designers, and there's someone
who is a tech lead or at a higher level.

00:29:17.227 --> 00:29:24.315
The team could have paired sessions
of working or programming

00:29:24.595 --> 00:29:29.296
where the person who is more senior
can work on the same computer

00:29:29.296 --> 00:29:32.686
with the juniors just to aid them
through their tasks.

00:29:33.226 --> 00:29:36.525
These kind of sessions
can be very useful when trying

00:29:36.526 --> 00:29:40.276
to [?] accessibility challenges.

00:29:40.515 --> 00:29:42.965
Maybe you are working
on an accessibility feature,

00:29:43.335 --> 00:29:46.936
a junior, you can take it to someone
who is more senior to you.

00:29:47.985 --> 00:29:53.204
Throughout the Agile process,
you can always follow up

00:29:53.205 --> 00:29:56.684
on accessibility issues
and just generally stories

00:29:56.685 --> 00:29:59.955
that can help us to achieve
our goal as a team.

00:30:05.566 --> 00:30:12.285
At the end of our sprints,
it is highly recommended that we hold

00:30:12.345 --> 00:30:13.426
a retrospective.

00:30:16.185 --> 00:30:18.285
This retrospective is,
as a matter of fact,

00:30:18.295 --> 00:30:20.755
one of the most important [?]

00:30:21.075 --> 00:30:24.886
where we sit down to evaluate
the sprints that just passed,

00:30:25.726 --> 00:30:28.935
and maybe we ask questions
like what went well,

00:30:29.172 --> 00:30:31.572
what should be improved,
what should be discarded

00:30:31.652 --> 00:30:37.786
because it wasn't working,
and so on and so forth.

00:30:40.687 --> 00:30:44.226
During these meetings,
you can reserve time on the agenda

00:30:45.005 --> 00:30:47.195
for discussing accessibility practices,

00:30:49.145 --> 00:30:52.124
and the accessibility skills
of team members will help

00:30:52.125 --> 00:30:53.775
in achieving accessibility goals.

00:30:53.925 --> 00:30:56.174
We can always block out time to say,

00:30:56.223 --> 00:30:59.676
"Oh, how can we improve
on our accessibility practices,

00:31:00.016 --> 00:31:03.776
and what do our members need
to improve on their accessibility skills?

00:31:04.396 --> 00:31:06.783
Are the methods
that we are using to achieve

00:31:06.856 --> 00:31:08.586
our accessibility goals working,

00:31:09.186 --> 00:31:11.255
or do we need
to try something else?"

00:31:11.915 --> 00:31:14.525
During these meetings,
the accessibility coach

00:31:14.526 --> 00:31:19.007
is very, very active,
because he or she

00:31:19.271 --> 00:31:24.080
or they help the team to answer very,
very important questions,

00:31:24.180 --> 00:31:29.616
and also try to see if the team
is pulling up as agreed,

00:31:29.645 --> 00:31:36.186
and if the team is moving
in the right direction.

00:31:37.476 --> 00:31:40.845
During these meetings,
it's advisable to seek open discussions

00:31:40.846 --> 00:31:45.426
on instances where skills
or practices were well implemented,

00:31:45.498 --> 00:31:47.788
because, of course,
when we do good work,

00:31:48.158 --> 00:31:50.658
it's important that we always
appreciate ourselves.

00:31:51.065 --> 00:31:56.017
Then, where maybe they were forgotten,
or maybe they did not work well,

00:31:56.466 --> 00:31:59.286
and we also try to identify
opportunities for coaching,

00:31:59.730 --> 00:32:00.730
skills training,

00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:05.015
or even any tools
that will help us to improve

00:32:05.016 --> 00:32:06.016
on our outcome.

00:32:14.801 --> 00:32:16.026
We're already at the end.

00:32:16.026 --> 00:32:17.026
Wow.

00:32:19.136 --> 00:32:20.712
Just some key takeaways.

00:32:21.756 --> 00:32:27.472
Since this talk is really
for everybody that works in a team,

00:32:27.942 --> 00:32:30.502
maybe you can be
a project manager,

00:32:30.742 --> 00:32:32.850
you may be a developer,

00:32:32.851 --> 00:32:34.601
a designer, regardless,

00:32:35.262 --> 00:32:38.562
there is always something
that you can contribute to accessibility.

00:32:39.005 --> 00:32:41.884
Even if your organization
has not bought into the idea,

00:32:41.885 --> 00:32:44.705
because that's the challenge that I face.

00:32:44.766 --> 00:32:48.016
Most of the projects that I work on,
I just take on the initiative

00:32:48.216 --> 00:32:50.406
to implement accessibility features.

00:32:50.646 --> 00:32:54.036
I'm not really given the time to do that,
but when I'm able,

00:32:54.066 --> 00:32:57.906
I just add a few things
to help improve on the application.

00:32:58.806 --> 00:33:00.956
Even if your organization
has not bought in,

00:33:01.346 --> 00:33:02.916
even if you feel like,

00:33:02.976 --> 00:33:07.306
"Oh, I'm just--"
just test, or I'm just this,

00:33:07.386 --> 00:33:10.344
there's always something
that you can contribute to accessibility.

00:33:10.344 --> 00:33:13.145
Just study the guidelines
and see where you're coming,

00:33:13.146 --> 00:33:14.228
see how you can contribute,

00:33:14.228 --> 00:33:18.198
no matter how you see the contribution,
it's going to go a long way.

00:33:19.496 --> 00:33:23.036
Also, like I said before,
the best time to include accessibility

00:33:23.037 --> 00:33:24.237
is from the start.

00:33:24.497 --> 00:33:27.760
If you're starting something today,
and you're lucky to be here,

00:33:27.789 --> 00:33:32.176
and we're talking about accessibility,
just think of how you can include it

00:33:32.226 --> 00:33:33.336
from the beginning,

00:33:33.575 --> 00:33:35.625
because it's going to cost you more time,

00:33:35.996 --> 00:33:39.339
more money, more effort,
if you postpone it to do it

00:33:39.385 --> 00:33:42.185
when your application has already matured.

00:33:43.716 --> 00:33:46.446
Again, accessibility
does not happen overnight.

00:33:46.887 --> 00:33:48.426
It requires time,

00:33:49.625 --> 00:33:52.385
management by a team effort,
and the support

00:33:52.386 --> 00:33:54.586
from the entire organization
to be a success.

00:33:55.746 --> 00:34:00.245
Be patient while you're trying
to implement accessibility,

00:34:00.595 --> 00:34:03.237
and don't be too hard on yourself.

00:34:07.025 --> 00:34:08.796
Thank you very much for listening.

00:34:09.425 --> 00:34:11.345
We still have a lot of time.

00:34:11.736 --> 00:34:13.685
So I think I will take questions now.

00:34:16.775 --> 00:34:18.275
Laura: Well, that was awesome.

00:34:18.335 --> 00:34:19.355
Congratulations.

00:34:19.356 --> 00:34:20.495
Great job on this.

00:34:20.975 --> 00:34:22.596
I wanted to give a shout out.

00:34:22.685 --> 00:34:25.145
Christopher put in the chat,
because I know

00:34:25.146 --> 00:34:26.646
that sometimes they scroll by.

00:34:26.916 --> 00:34:31.866
He's literally going to propose
accessible acceptance in an hour.

00:34:32.315 --> 00:34:37.356
This talk came at a great time
that he's taking away and already sharing

00:34:37.596 --> 00:34:40.355
your ideas with his coworkers.

00:34:40.600 --> 00:34:43.360
[crosstalk] He praised you on that.

00:34:47.074 --> 00:34:50.406
A lot of people are using sprint planning.

00:34:52.315 --> 00:34:54.336
The ideas that you gave to them,

00:34:55.085 --> 00:34:59.874
they love those to incorporate
them into the future with that.

00:34:59.944 --> 00:35:01.594
We do have a couple of questions.

00:35:01.746 --> 00:35:02.846
We'll move on to that.

00:35:04.475 --> 00:35:10.865
What is a common issue or topic you have
to keep addressing as front-end developer?

00:35:11.165 --> 00:35:15.094
Something that keeps being repeated
or addressed often

00:35:15.095 --> 00:35:18.965
that you could give us insight
and/or helpful ways

00:35:18.995 --> 00:35:23.346
to address in an Agile way
as we address,

00:35:24.486 --> 00:35:27.186
do the same things

00:35:28.506 --> 00:35:30.785
when we gather groups to discuss.

00:35:31.746 --> 00:35:34.115
What are some things that keep coming up?

00:35:36.145 --> 00:35:37.145
Issues.

00:35:37.886 --> 00:35:40.686
Nasah: Please, can you just take
the question over again?

00:35:40.705 --> 00:35:41.855
I was a bit distracted.

00:35:46.585 --> 00:35:47.735
Laura: I'm sorry, what?

00:35:47.905 --> 00:35:50.315
Nasah: I said, can you
take the patient again?

00:35:50.365 --> 00:35:52.695
I was a bit distracted.

00:35:56.015 --> 00:35:58.257
Laura: If you want to open up
the Q&amp;A at the bottom

00:35:58.257 --> 00:36:00.425
and if you want to read through that.

00:36:05.703 --> 00:36:06.907
It's the first one.

00:36:07.428 --> 00:36:17.058
[silence]

00:36:17.332 --> 00:36:19.049
Nasah: Okay.

00:36:20.106 --> 00:36:23.314
What common issue
or topic I've been addressing

00:36:23.315 --> 00:36:24.786
as a front-end developer?

00:36:32.581 --> 00:36:35.727
Wow, this really is a bit very general.

00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:38.585
I'm trying to think of something

00:36:40.926 --> 00:36:42.186
off the top of my head.

00:36:43.655 --> 00:36:44.655
Let me see.

00:36:50.376 --> 00:36:54.188
I don't really think that I've had
any issue that keeps

00:36:54.209 --> 00:36:56.219
coming up repeatedly

00:36:57.920 --> 00:37:00.189
that I've had to address,

00:37:00.610 --> 00:37:09.936
but I will say that something
like dealing with state management,

00:37:10.926 --> 00:37:16.685
because most of the applications
that I've built I normally work

00:37:17.346 --> 00:37:26.705
with [?] I've discovered that the idea
of handling the state of an application

00:37:28.115 --> 00:37:32.916
is a topic that maybe I feel like it has
a steep learning curve.

00:37:33.833 --> 00:37:34.804
There are many times

00:37:34.804 --> 00:37:39.010
that maybe you can start
building something

00:37:39.110 --> 00:37:44.700
and you are managing data,
but over time you discover

00:37:44.730 --> 00:37:49.265
that you need to change
your methods of handling data,

00:37:49.866 --> 00:37:51.499
because as the application grows,

00:37:51.499 --> 00:37:54.275
you need to reuse other tools

00:37:55.445 --> 00:37:56.525
and try to adapt.

00:37:58.485 --> 00:37:59.496
For me,

00:38:01.055 --> 00:38:04.175
I will say that you should always
just do research,

00:38:04.236 --> 00:38:05.836
because when technology changes,

00:38:05.861 --> 00:38:08.558
and there's really
no one-size-fits-all approach

00:38:08.627 --> 00:38:09.627
to anything.

00:38:10.227 --> 00:38:13.824
It's true that you can address
a particular challenge today

00:38:13.825 --> 00:38:15.921
and maybe tomorrow
it comes in another way,

00:38:15.921 --> 00:38:18.771
you still have to find
a way to address it.

00:38:19.353 --> 00:38:20.353
It's not maybe

00:38:20.826 --> 00:38:24.216
a one-size-fits-all kind of approach.

00:38:24.877 --> 00:38:28.866
Just be open and flexible,
because really that's the idea of Agile.

00:38:29.166 --> 00:38:32.405
Something comes up, you try
to adjust it and you adapt.

00:38:32.616 --> 00:38:33.896
Even if it comes up again,

00:38:33.896 --> 00:38:37.955
you see why it's coming up again
and you try to address it.

00:38:38.135 --> 00:38:42.070
It's not really like you can solve
an issue once and for all.

00:38:43.146 --> 00:38:44.945
As the application grows,

00:38:44.946 --> 00:38:48.935
as things change, you always need
to change your approach.

00:38:50.846 --> 00:38:51.896
Laura: Okay, awesome.

00:38:52.086 --> 00:38:53.086
Thank you.

00:38:53.244 --> 00:38:59.882
The next question from Anonymous,
do you have suggestions

00:38:59.883 --> 00:39:03.494
to get support
from key project leaders

00:39:03.543 --> 00:39:05.315
to help with accessibility?

00:39:08.915 --> 00:39:10.955
Nasah: Oh, yes.
I don't have

00:39:12.506 --> 00:39:14.915
a very personal opinion,
but the book I used,

00:39:16.106 --> 00:39:17.926
I think I put the name of the book.

00:39:18.215 --> 00:39:21.365
There's the Agile Accessibility Handbook
by Dylan Handbell.

00:39:21.366 --> 00:39:25.174
He really talks
about some very good moments and methods

00:39:25.175 --> 00:39:29.088
that you can use to obtain
management buy-in.

00:39:29.457 --> 00:39:32.765
He emphasizes on the fact
that you should take it gradually,

00:39:33.995 --> 00:39:41.705
because you take time to convince
management and the other teams that affect

00:39:41.855 --> 00:39:42.905
the development team.

00:39:43.565 --> 00:39:48.066
You can just always look at the book,
because there are some really good tips

00:39:48.104 --> 00:39:53.555
on getting your project leaders
and every other person on board

00:39:53.675 --> 00:39:59.026
when trying to get
into Agile accessibility.

00:40:00.366 --> 00:40:04.866
Laura: It's always great to have
those resources at your fingertips,

00:40:05.826 --> 00:40:10.444
whether it's bookmarking
or actually buying a book that has

00:40:10.445 --> 00:40:13.475
that information
so that you can use that as a resource.

00:40:13.716 --> 00:40:19.415
Because then it makes your credibility
even a little bit more important

00:40:19.416 --> 00:40:22.114
to those people,
because sometimes they're like,

00:40:22.115 --> 00:40:24.576
"Well, who are you to say that?"

00:40:25.265 --> 00:40:31.026
To have those resources to be able
to back you up sometimes is really good.

00:40:31.566 --> 00:40:32.486
That's awesome.

00:40:32.486 --> 00:40:34.966
All right. Our time is--
I'm sorry.

00:40:35.176 --> 00:40:36.425
We have one more question.

00:40:36.425 --> 00:40:40.386
What are some of the best tools
that you recommend using

00:40:40.975 --> 00:40:42.786
during the testing phase?

00:40:43.416 --> 00:40:44.616
You had touched on that.

00:40:46.591 --> 00:40:52.775
Nasah: I generally just use
the Axe browser extension.

00:40:53.332 --> 00:40:56.702
It should be available for most browsers.

00:40:57.122 --> 00:40:58.502
That's what I use.

00:40:59.372 --> 00:41:06.627
I'm still not very experienced
with using more complex tools.

00:41:06.687 --> 00:41:10.884
So I just use Axe because it gives me
all of my vulnerability issues clearly,

00:41:10.943 --> 00:41:12.946
and I can just quickly go
through them

00:41:12.947 --> 00:41:15.047
and try to solve the ones
that I can solve.

00:41:17.706 --> 00:41:18.545
Yeah.

00:41:18.545 --> 00:41:22.265
Laura: The browsers are coming up
with a lot of great extension tools

00:41:22.266 --> 00:41:23.706
that are free to use.

00:41:24.185 --> 00:41:26.285
Those are always good to start with first.

00:41:26.916 --> 00:41:31.144
Then, as everyone has said in the past,
it's always good to just do

00:41:31.145 --> 00:41:35.015
a manual check too,
and not relying on a tool.

00:41:37.086 --> 00:41:40.265
Having different people
look at the website too,

00:41:40.296 --> 00:41:41.795
would be really beneficial.

00:41:42.757 --> 00:41:44.007
Nasah: Yes, that's right.

00:41:44.978 --> 00:41:45.788
Laura: All right.

00:41:45.788 --> 00:41:49.190
If nobody else has a question
that they want to put in the Q&amp;A,

00:41:51.335 --> 00:41:54.426
I thank you very much and appreciate that.

00:41:54.725 --> 00:42:02.166
We'll give our captioner and interpreter
a little bit extra time for a break.

00:42:02.736 --> 00:42:04.506
We will see you at the top of the hour.

00:42:04.506 --> 00:42:05.506
Thank you, everyone.

00:42:06.245 --> 00:42:07.595
Nasah: Thank you very much.

00:42:08.465 --> 00:42:09.465
Laura: Bye.
