00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:39.880
Fahad, Athira, take it away.

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:41.950
Fahad Lambate: Thanks Sherose.

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:43.330
Thanks for that intro.

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:47.860
I'll just quickly share my screen.

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.540
I believe the intro has already happened,

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:02.650
so I'll just brief about myself,
what I like to do in my free time.

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:07.490
Apart from being an accessibility
enthusiast, I'm also an avid gamer.

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.930
I do enjoy playing a lot of games,
be it PS5, be it PC, mobile,

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.300
and I also like to tweak gadgets
in my free time.

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.740
I have definitely destroyed
a couple of gadgets while tweaking them,

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.340
so that was an experience as well.

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:29.620
Yeah.

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:32.310
Over to you, Athira.

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.180
Athira Mohanan: Hi, everyone.

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:38.350
It's really amazing to be here.

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:41.760
Also, I have started my career

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.710
with accessibility with BarrierBreak

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.500
and it's been a long journey,
still learning.

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.230
I believe in butterfly effect,
so always a small change

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.420
can create a huge impact.

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.810
Hoping for that and back to you, Fahad.

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:00.480
Fahad: Thanks, Athira.

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:06.510
Before we start with our topic,
I'll just give a brief about BarrierBreak.

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:10.190
We are into accessibility
since more than 19 years now.

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:17.330
We do have an amazing team
of more than 250 members, who helps us

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.400
creating a digital world
more accessible, be it

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:24.470
website, applications, documents,

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:28.440
performing design reviews, creating VPAT.

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.070
We do all those stuff.

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:32.350
Apart from that,

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.150
I'd also say we believe
in people-first approach

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:39.770
and we do have an accessibility

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:43.950
lab in our office, wherein
there are different assistive

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:48.820
technologies available,
so anyone in office can come

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.000
and experience those things.

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:55.530
Because I'll say

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:58.830
when it comes to accessibility,
not everyone knows it initially.

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:02.970
When they actually go dive
into the accessibility world,

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:04.910
they come to know
there are a lot of things

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:08.080
that needs to be learned
and needs to be implemented.

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:15.480
We do cater to different regions
around the world, UK, US, Australia.

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.120
We, like now, I'll say

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:24.230
it has been really a great experience
over here.

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.760
Without further ado,
let's dive into the topic.

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:32.930
I'm sure you must have heard
what accessibility is.

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:36.370
This is just our brief
understanding of accessibility.

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:40.740
Like basically it allows people
to use anything, product, service,

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:41.910
in the way they want,

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.580
using the tool they want, using,

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.080
like now, how they want.

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:52.190
That's accessibility, is for us.

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:55.690
It shouldn't
stop anyone from accessing any products,

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:57.970
things, or services.

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:02.510
When it comes to accessibility
and e-commerce,

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:05.700
because nowadays, especially post-COVID,

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:10.070
digital world
has been drastically changed.

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:12.110
Everything is digital.

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:14.240
How can we forget the e-commerce part?

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:19.510
E-commerce was always digital
most of the time, along with offline

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:20.750
stores as well.

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:25.640
When we club accessibility
and e-commerce,

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:30.120
again, I'm sure you must have heard
in different talks about

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:33.960
we have billions of people
with disabilities across the world.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.470
It helps you to increase
reach to those customers as well,

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:45.110
so that everyone is included
in the experience.

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:48.280
They can order whatever they want,
whatever they need.

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:52.650
It also not only helps
to reach the customers, it also helps you

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:56.920
to ensure your e-commerce sites
are legally compliant

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:00.660
with different standards
that are applicable in different regions,

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:06.730
be it ADA standards,
Section 580, EN 301, 549, and EAA,

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:13.460
which is around
the horizon, that will get implemented.

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:17.840
Apart from that, when people know that

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:20.940
your site is accessible,

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:25.310
the customer satisfaction,
I can say, is a lot.

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:28.320
Because when they have
a good user experience

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:30.750
along with an accessible experience,

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:34.260
that definitely also helps improve
your brand loyalty.

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:39.530
Your responsibility towards
making your sites accessible,

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:45.100
and also the message that you're sending
to your e-commerce sites,

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:49.300
that you believe in equality
and you believe

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:52.410
in giving equitable experience
for every user.

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:57.280
Now, coming to what is WooCommerce.

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:01.280
When it comes to WooCommerce,
if simply put across, it's just an open

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:05.520
source WordPress plugin
that is available for e-commerce.

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:10.120
You can build your online store
using this plugin of WooCommerce.

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:16.200
You can even add different product
listings to your e-commerce sites.

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:20.200
You can categorize your products.

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:24.910
You can even add certain payment
and shipping

00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:27.910
gateways to your website as well

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:31.050
to this plugin
by integrating it with them.

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:35.850
It's easy to do that when you're using
a WooCommerce at the back end.

00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:38.050
Also, when it comes to different plugins

00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:41.460
and extension
for ensuring that customer management,

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:46.290
while you're managing the customer
basically, and gathering the information.

00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:50.200
It also allows to use different plugins
and extension

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:52.150
in WooCommerce.

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:56.900
When it comes to accessibility
in WooCommerce,

00:07:56.940 --> 00:08:01.380
I'll hand it over to Athira
so she can help you understand

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:04.450
how WooCommerce is accessible.

00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:07.220
Athira: Sure Fahad.

00:08:08.850 --> 00:08:12.420
Now that Fahad has given you
an overview of the WooCommerce,

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:15.860
let's dive into the accessibility
part of the WooCommerce.

00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:19.260
Accessibility starts
with a well-structured HTML

00:08:20.190 --> 00:08:25.100
and the WooCommerce platform
has a built-in support for semantic HTML.

00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:29.970
Using semantic HTML
tags like header, footer, main,

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:34.180
so this creates a well-structured website
that is easier for the assistive

00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:37.280
technology users like screen reader
or speech

00:08:37.710 --> 00:08:41.280
recognition users
to interpret the content.

00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:45.550
Of course, we all know that

00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:50.860
native HTML provides accessibility without
requiring additional external resources,

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:55.700
so WooCommerce also allows
the user to integrate ARIA as well.

00:08:56.960 --> 00:09:00.670
When it comes to the interactive elements
like product galleries,

00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:04.110
carousels, filters, and shopping carts.

00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:07.340
When we are using these features provided

00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:10.310
with a dynamic shopping experience,

00:09:10.410 --> 00:09:14.250
there can be sometimes a bit difficulty
for the users with disability

00:09:14.350 --> 00:09:19.220
to navigate through such content,
this is where the ARIA comes into play.

00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:23.620
ARIA attribute helps to make the complex

00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:26.860
interactive components understandable
for the assistive technology.

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:30.500
For example,
if there is an expandable control,

00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:36.140
so providing ARIA expanded attribute
will help the user, especially the screen

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:40.810
reader user, to understand the expanded
and collapsed state of the control.

00:09:41.510 --> 00:09:45.350
HTML, along with the right use of ARIA,
obviously provide

00:09:45.450 --> 00:09:50.790
assistive technology compatibility
and also a proper keyboard navigation.

00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:53.920
Another key feature regarding

00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:57.020
WooCommerce is that customizable element.

00:09:57.260 --> 00:10:00.260
For a long vision user,
especially when they are

00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:03.160
accessing an e-commerce site,

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:06.530
if they want to adjust the font size
or contrast

00:10:07.270 --> 00:10:11.950
setting or even the text spacing,
if they want to use it comfortably.

00:10:13.770 --> 00:10:18.150
Then WooCommerce really shines over here
because it allows the user

00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:24.090
to provide a toolbar where
they can select these options.

00:10:24.890 --> 00:10:27.320
That's the functionality of WooCommerce

00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:29.420
that we are getting additional.

00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:36.330
These are the features that WooCommerce
is obviously providing us,

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:40.370
because of the accessibility features
and all the WooCommerce stands out

00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:42.620
when it comes to plugins.

00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:48.180
Even though the majority
of the accessibility

00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:55.280
lies with developers and other testers
who are there in the industries,

00:10:55.650 --> 00:10:58.890
still there is a chance
that we can improve these plugins

00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:01.490
when it comes to accessibility.

00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:04.590
While WooCommerce templates
provide a starting point

00:11:04.690 --> 00:11:09.700
for the accessibility navigation,
not all interactive elements are optimized

00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:13.100
for users who rely solely on keyboard.

00:11:14.170 --> 00:11:19.240
For example, as I have already mentioned,
like product filters and pop-ups and all.

00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:23.970
Sometimes what happens,

00:11:24.450 --> 00:11:30.710
they suffer from poor tabbing orders,
missing focus indicators,

00:11:31.150 --> 00:11:38.430
and such limitations will create confusion
for the users who is using the site.

00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:43.330
Here WooCommerce can make sure
that interactive elements can be accessed

00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:48.440
and navigated using the keyboard alone
and keyboard focus indicator

00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:51.540
should be visible and consistent
throughout the site.

00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:57.180
As I have already mentioned regarding
the templates of the WooCommerce,

00:11:57.750 --> 00:12:00.750
we have one more thing that is forms.

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:04.690
Obviously for a e-commerce website,
forms are really important.

00:12:05.090 --> 00:12:07.930
To complete the purchase order
or the shipping order,

00:12:08.170 --> 00:12:09.890
a form is really important.

00:12:09.990 --> 00:12:13.960
Yes, WooCommerce do provide such forms,
but the only concern here

00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:17.800
is that the error messages
and the feedbacks are not conveyed

00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:19.670
for the screen reader user.

00:12:19.770 --> 00:12:22.500
To resolve this,
we can improve the accessibility

00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:25.510
of the form validation
by adding an ARIA-like feature

00:12:25.810 --> 00:12:28.410
to the dynamic success
and the error messages,

00:12:28.510 --> 00:12:31.850
or we can provide a clear and concise
error message

00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:35.580
that can be programmatically
tied to the form first.

00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:38.820
This will ensure that the users
are informed of

00:12:38.910 --> 00:12:42.220
the issues and can be guided
to resolve and complete

00:12:42.330 --> 00:12:44.590
the checkout or the payment process

00:12:44.710 --> 00:12:46.400
or any other forms.

00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:51.230
Next is regarding the skipping.

00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:54.640
We all know that
when there is a multiple--

00:12:55.670 --> 00:12:59.570
Especially for the keyboard-only user,
when navigating through a web page.

00:13:00.170 --> 00:13:02.580
In the header section,
if there are multiple links

00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:07.080
and we have to go through
multiple web pages.

00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:12.550
It's a bit frustrating experience
for the keyboard-only user to tap

00:13:12.650 --> 00:13:16.990
through the same content again and again
just to reach to the main content.

00:13:18.090 --> 00:13:20.590
Most of the website,
if you see there is a pattern

00:13:20.590 --> 00:13:23.600
that the header and the footer are fixed.

00:13:24.830 --> 00:13:26.800
When navigating through these control

00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:30.840
in multiple pages,
this might create frustration

00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:35.680
for the user,
so it is always good to have a skip link.

00:13:35.780 --> 00:13:40.650
WooCommerce default
themes does not have this currently,

00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:43.950
so implementing
that would be a better option.

00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:51.960
Coming to the plugins, custom
plugins are something

00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:55.860
that we use in our day-to-day
life when we are building

00:13:56.060 --> 00:14:01.940
a website, not just e-commerce website,
even other website also.

00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:05.810
A third-party plugins, mostly
I can see that an iframe is used

00:14:06.070 --> 00:14:08.940
or any other chatbot is used, or something

00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:11.510
like a third-party tool is always used.

00:14:12.450 --> 00:14:16.450
We have to make sure that these plugins
are 100% accessible

00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:22.120
so that it wouldn't limit
the user to access the content.

00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:25.430
For example,

00:14:25.430 --> 00:14:29.300
like third-party plugins
that adds interactive features

00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:32.900
such as product galleries,
sliders or pop-ups

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:37.140
which may have proper keyboard
accessibility or ARIA support.

00:14:37.810 --> 00:14:42.810
There we can keep a strict guidelines
for the plugins

00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:45.220
that we can use in our website.

00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:51.790
When it comes to product pages,

00:14:51.890 --> 00:14:55.190
WooCommerce provides
a wide variety of themes

00:14:55.290 --> 00:14:59.430
where you can select
multiple products images.

00:14:59.530 --> 00:15:03.000
Your can upload that to your website
so the user can have

00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:06.530
a full-on experience
to see all the products on the page.

00:15:07.710 --> 00:15:10.750
When these images
are added to the screens,

00:15:11.370 --> 00:15:15.610
so there is a requirement
of alternate text for these images.

00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:18.150
That part will be covered later.

00:15:18.250 --> 00:15:21.920
But as of now,
the WooCommerce doesn't enforce it

00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:26.590
that the images that we are uploading
should have an alternate text.

00:15:26.690 --> 00:15:28.770
That is something that we can improve

00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:34.530
by enforcing the users
who are the developers

00:15:34.630 --> 00:15:38.970
who are using the WooCommerce
to add alternate text.

00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:42.170
Finally, panel changes

00:15:42.170 --> 00:15:46.070
after updates can be challenging
for WooCommerce developers

00:15:46.470 --> 00:15:51.250
committed to the accessibility, especially
when WooCommerce releases update.

00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:55.280
Does it change that
some of the accessibility improvements

00:15:55.780 --> 00:15:58.590
whether related to ARIA attributes,

00:15:58.690 --> 00:16:01.690
keyboard navigation or formula labels,

00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:04.330
this could be overwritten.

00:16:05.790 --> 00:16:10.400
A potential solution is to implement
a rollback system that ensures

00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:15.500
any customized accessibility
enhancements are preserved across updates.

00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:19.110
WooCommerce
could also consider an accessibility audit

00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:23.210
with each update
to prevent breaking changes.

00:16:26.850 --> 00:16:28.260
Compatibility.

00:16:29.450 --> 00:16:32.990
As you can already see in this slide,
compatibility between

00:16:33.090 --> 00:16:37.120
WordPress and WooCommerce theme is crucial
for achieving full accessibility.

00:16:37.690 --> 00:16:41.030
When we have WordPress accessibility,

00:16:41.830 --> 00:16:44.400
we have a feature that WordPress provides

00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:47.400
that is accessibility ready feature.

00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:51.870
Here we can select
or we will get the themes

00:16:51.970 --> 00:16:55.980
that means the accessibility standards
right from the start.

00:16:56.710 --> 00:17:01.520
These themes comes with features
like schematic HTML markup,

00:17:01.950 --> 00:17:06.020
keyboard navigation
support and screen reader compatibility,

00:17:06.390 --> 00:17:09.390
giving us a strong foundation
for accessibility.

00:17:10.790 --> 00:17:14.430
WooCommerce is also a powerful tool
for building e-commerce stores,

00:17:14.860 --> 00:17:17.830
but it's essential that we choose
or customize

00:17:17.930 --> 00:17:20.930
WooCommerce themes with accessibility
in mind.

00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:26.110
Many WooCommerce themes don't fully adhere
to accessibility guidelines by default.

00:17:26.810 --> 00:17:30.880
That's why the accessibility ready
filter is a great help.

00:17:31.450 --> 00:17:35.120
It enables the user to pick themes
that supports

00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:39.620
both e-commerce
functionality and accessibility standards.

00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:44.630
However, one thing that we need to keep in
mind is that even though the label

00:17:44.730 --> 00:17:49.760
is provided as accessibility ready,
it doesn't mean that the job is done.

00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:53.270
Some customization,
especially with WooCommerce

00:17:53.370 --> 00:17:59.280
specific plugins might need manual
adjustment to maintain full accessibility.

00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:01.810
Let's have a check

00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:06.050
on most popular accessibility

00:18:06.050 --> 00:18:09.120
themes that we currently have
with WooCommerce.

00:18:09.850 --> 00:18:14.560
At the top, we have storefront
developed by the WooCommerce core team.

00:18:15.090 --> 00:18:19.630
It's specifically designed for e-commerce
store, making it a natural choice

00:18:19.730 --> 00:18:24.770
for the accessibility since it's developed
by the same team behind the WooCommerce.

00:18:25.730 --> 00:18:28.170
It ensures seamless integration

00:18:28.170 --> 00:18:31.410
and others to the best practices
for accessibility.

00:18:32.670 --> 00:18:35.810
Moving down,
we have themes like GeneratePress,

00:18:35.910 --> 00:18:38.980
Neve, Zakra and Blocksy.

00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:42.280
These themes are versatile,
making them ideal

00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:46.090
for a variety of purpose,
including blogs, news,

00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:48.990
e-commerce stores,

00:18:49.090 --> 00:18:52.090
business portfolio and more.

00:18:53.460 --> 00:18:55.800
Particularly the GeneratePress

00:18:55.900 --> 00:19:00.200
is a popular choice due to its clean code
and accessibility ready feature,

00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:04.300
which reduces unnecessary complexities
for the users.

00:19:05.010 --> 00:19:07.940
All of these themes offers
a great starting point

00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:12.010
for the developers
to build an accessible website,

00:19:13.350 --> 00:19:16.250
but we have to make sure that

00:19:16.350 --> 00:19:20.150
efforts are taken
to improve the accessibility

00:19:20.490 --> 00:19:22.440
manually as well.

00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:28.430
This was all regarding
the accessibility features

00:19:28.430 --> 00:19:34.130
and the improvement areas that we can have
in the WooCommerce platform.

00:19:34.370 --> 00:19:39.140
Now let's see how we can design the website
by keeping inclusivity in mind.

00:19:40.210 --> 00:19:43.210
Let's start with a basic one,
that is the color contrast.

00:19:43.940 --> 00:19:48.820
When you're browsing through the website

00:19:48.970 --> 00:19:53.720
or any other sites that we currently have,
come across on day-to-day life,

00:19:53.820 --> 00:19:57.260
we can understand that
color plays an important part.

00:19:59.190 --> 00:20:02.400
We have to make sure
that color contrast is

00:20:03.430 --> 00:20:06.420
met as per the standards of WCAG.

00:20:07.370 --> 00:20:11.340
For the standard text,
the minimum color contrast

00:20:11.570 --> 00:20:14.580
ratio is 4.5:1 with the background.

00:20:15.310 --> 00:20:18.150
The text needs to pass this criteria,

00:20:18.250 --> 00:20:21.510
and for the last text, it should be 3:1.

00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:29.620
For the non-text elements,
such as a graphical image

00:20:32.130 --> 00:20:36.730
or any other image that conveys
the information or the border

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:42.200
of the input field or focus indicator,

00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:45.710
this should have a minimum contrast
ratio of 3:1.

00:20:46.570 --> 00:20:52.080
Incorporating accessibility
in your website

00:20:52.150 --> 00:20:56.280
will improve the look and feel along with

00:20:57.680 --> 00:21:01.110
a wide range of users.

00:21:05.030 --> 00:21:08.700
Remember a good contrast
doesn't just help people

00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:12.870
with disability,
it also improves the overall readability

00:21:13.100 --> 00:21:16.200
and usability of the web pages.

00:21:21.110 --> 00:21:23.370
Let's see what is the next--

00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:33.590
I wanted to add
one more point to the color.

00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:39.560
It's not just the color contrast,
there is one more part that is color alone

00:21:39.660 --> 00:21:43.200
also that we need to consider,
because we have

00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:49.670
people who have the condition
of color blindness.

00:21:50.370 --> 00:21:53.570
For them,
it is better to implement the pages

00:21:53.670 --> 00:21:57.780
that can be easily visible
and easily understandable.

00:21:58.110 --> 00:22:02.780
Make sure that you don't rely completely
on color to convey the information.

00:22:03.220 --> 00:22:06.790
Here in this example,
there is a link that says pages.

00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:12.290
If you notice, there is an underline
which stands out from other text.

00:22:12.930 --> 00:22:17.600
This will convey the colorblind user
that okay, this is something

00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:22.170
that is interactive and I can activate
this to get to the page.

00:22:24.540 --> 00:22:27.940
That was regarding the color.
Let's see the next

00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:31.180
part that we can incorporate

00:22:31.260 --> 00:22:34.180
in our designs, that is image.

00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:39.050
We cannot imagine an e-commerce website
without the product image, right?

00:22:39.450 --> 00:22:44.590
I mean, take any example, Amazon,
any of the example.

00:22:44.930 --> 00:22:47.930
Without image,
we cannot imagine a website.

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:52.600
Images plays an important part
in enhancing the user interface

00:22:52.700 --> 00:22:54.130
of your website.

00:22:54.770 --> 00:22:57.770
The accessibility regarding image
is pretty much simple.

00:22:58.040 --> 00:23:00.540
If the image is decorative,

00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:02.440
hide them programmatically.

00:23:02.540 --> 00:23:07.110
If the IMG tag is used,
then the alt should be kept empty.

00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:11.420
If there is any other SVG image
or anything that is decorative,

00:23:11.750 --> 00:23:16.420
then you can provide area hidden
simply to hide the image from the user.

00:23:16.820 --> 00:23:21.420
If it is decorative, then
you don't have to provide any details.

00:23:22.860 --> 00:23:25.830
If the image is informative,
you have to make sure

00:23:25.930 --> 00:23:29.170
that a descriptive alternate text
is provided for the image.

00:23:30.070 --> 00:23:35.040
When a screen reader encounters
an image in the website,

00:23:35.310 --> 00:23:39.410
it reads out the alt text, helping
user understand what the image represent.

00:23:39.510 --> 00:23:42.550
Without alt text, these users

00:23:42.750 --> 00:23:45.750
would miss out
an important part of the image.

00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:49.310
Especially when we are creating
e-commerce websites,

00:23:49.510 --> 00:23:51.760
the product images are really important.

00:23:52.930 --> 00:23:56.770
If there is no description or anything
that is given for that product,

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:01.800
then pretty much possible that
they might not be interested

00:24:01.950 --> 00:24:03.370
on the products.

00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:08.940
Just giving alternate text,
not just provide accessibility,

00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:12.850
but also improves your SEO
by helping search engines

00:24:12.950 --> 00:24:15.950
to understand the content of the images.

00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:18.690
Over to you, Fahad.

00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:20.170
You can continue.

00:24:23.110 --> 00:24:25.530
Fahad: Thanks, Athira,
for sharing that information.

00:24:25.630 --> 00:24:28.630
I'll just add
to what Athira mentioned about images.

00:24:29.230 --> 00:24:33.070
When you go to your WooCommerce,
and you're trying to upload

00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:38.210
certain products,
so you will see a kind of a media dialog

00:24:38.810 --> 00:24:42.510
in that at the right-hand section
of that particular dialog.

00:24:42.610 --> 00:24:45.050
Once you upload any particular image,

00:24:45.150 --> 00:24:48.920
you will find certain fields
where you can enter your alt text.

00:24:49.350 --> 00:24:53.650
Or if you want to add a caption to that
particular image, you can even do that

00:24:54.090 --> 00:24:56.590
while adding a product

00:24:56.690 --> 00:24:59.690
image on that particular
e-commerce website.

00:25:02.970 --> 00:25:05.110
Now coming to the structure,

00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:08.710
when we talk about websites,
how we can forget the structure.

00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:14.210
There are a lot of features,
I can say, which WooCommerce or WordPress,

00:25:14.310 --> 00:25:18.810
if we say, it gives a lot of ways
to add structure to your webpage.

00:25:18.910 --> 00:25:23.200
Be it heading, lists, tables, landmarks.

00:25:23.660 --> 00:25:29.220
It helps you to ensure that
your content of your website

00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:31.350
is in a proper structured manner.

00:25:31.530 --> 00:25:33.660
Be it ensuring that

00:25:33.820 --> 00:25:37.280
every page having a heading 1 or ensuring

00:25:37.420 --> 00:25:40.750
that the content is not structured
as a heading.

00:25:41.250 --> 00:25:45.850
You will get a kind of a panel
once you are into your website

00:25:45.950 --> 00:25:49.060
and you try to edit
the content of your website.

00:25:49.390 --> 00:25:52.220
There would be a toolbar through
which you can add

00:25:52.330 --> 00:25:55.730
such formatting to like,
you know, if you want

00:25:55.830 --> 00:25:59.370
a particular text to be heading
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

00:25:59.750 --> 00:26:01.620
You can do that easily.

00:26:01.730 --> 00:26:07.610
Ensure that it is as per the hierarchy
and as per the context of your page

00:26:08.010 --> 00:26:11.610
and ensure that it is following
the hierarchical manner as well.

00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:14.180
It should start from H1 to H6.

00:26:14.210 --> 00:26:16.820
Don't forget to skip
any heading in between.

00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:19.890
That really confuses a screen reader user,

00:26:20.290 --> 00:26:24.520
because it might appear to them
that they have forgot

00:26:25.090 --> 00:26:29.260
one of the section on the page
and they might just be like--

00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:32.000
and it would be a frustrating
experience for them.

00:26:33.330 --> 00:26:36.570
When it comes to list,
there is also a way to add a list structure

00:26:36.710 --> 00:26:38.470
be it an unordered list, ordered list.

00:26:38.570 --> 00:26:43.280
You can do that using the toolbar
that is given in WordPress.

00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:47.510
You can add your information
in a sequential manner.

00:26:48.150 --> 00:26:51.510
Ensure when you are giving
the products information,

00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:54.990
different specification
for your product, highlights

00:26:54.990 --> 00:26:58.020
of your product, ensure
they are correctly marked in a list

00:26:58.620 --> 00:27:03.160
so user can understand how many features
are there for your products

00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:06.350
or what are the key
highlights of your products.

00:27:08.030 --> 00:27:13.550
Apart from that, ensuring any structure
that needs to be in tabular format.

00:27:14.010 --> 00:27:18.980
When you are trying to compare something,
when you want to showcase why

00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:21.850
your product is better than others,

00:27:21.950 --> 00:27:25.520
we always have a comparison table
in product

00:27:25.990 --> 00:27:29.090
review section
or maybe product description section.

00:27:29.620 --> 00:27:31.460
Ensure those are well-formed.

00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:34.590
They are having appropriate
headers, column headers, row headers.

00:27:35.930 --> 00:27:37.000
You can add that.

00:27:37.030 --> 00:27:41.100
You can see there is a screenshot
available wherein you can add a table

00:27:41.430 --> 00:27:44.640
and you can add how many columns you want,
how many rows you want.

00:27:45.170 --> 00:27:49.260
You can even create a complex table
using this feature because

00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:53.110
one amazing thing that I'll say WordPress
gives you

00:27:53.180 --> 00:27:54.930
or WooCommerce gives you is

00:27:55.850 --> 00:27:59.260
customizing the HTML behind it.

00:28:00.050 --> 00:28:02.590
You can easily customize the HTML

00:28:02.690 --> 00:28:06.630
and try to enhance the accessibility
within the given component

00:28:07.230 --> 00:28:09.830
and that can be done easily.

00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:13.130
Apart from that, adding landmarks.

00:28:13.230 --> 00:28:15.840
That is something you need to do.

00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:19.540
Some of the themes which Athira mentioned,

00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:22.880
most of the themes
I can say would be having

00:28:22.980 --> 00:28:27.510
at least basic landmarks within it
like header, footer, main content.

00:28:27.950 --> 00:28:30.720
But if there are any additional
complementary landmarks

00:28:30.820 --> 00:28:35.190
that you want to provide, like just
a quick information about the product.

00:28:35.860 --> 00:28:38.190
That is something
you can easily do again by

00:28:39.660 --> 00:28:41.030
adding a customized

00:28:41.130 --> 00:28:43.930
code into your e-commerce site,

00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:47.670
so that user can easily jump
to those landmarks

00:28:47.770 --> 00:28:50.370
and get that information.

00:28:52.940 --> 00:28:54.340
Next is about the layout

00:28:54.340 --> 00:28:57.040
and the design of your e-commerce site.

00:28:57.780 --> 00:29:01.480
It needs to be having
consistent navigation.

00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:02.720
What do we mean by this?

00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:05.890
Basically, when you are having certain

00:29:07.590 --> 00:29:10.530
navigation elements
in your header or footer,

00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:12.090
that needs to be consistent.

00:29:12.190 --> 00:29:16.000
Don't play around
just for the sake of making it

00:29:16.060 --> 00:29:19.670
more visually appealing
or making it fancy.

00:29:19.970 --> 00:29:22.700
You can still make a website fancy

00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:25.400
along with keeping
the accessibility intact.

00:29:25.860 --> 00:29:30.750
Just don't make
your navigation inconsistent,

00:29:30.930 --> 00:29:33.650
which will cause people with disabilities

00:29:33.750 --> 00:29:39.550
to really confusing experience
it will be, because they would say,

00:29:39.620 --> 00:29:42.250
okay, in header section, I have visited

00:29:42.350 --> 00:29:43.480
this particular link,

00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:46.040
but now that is not available
in header section.

00:29:46.820 --> 00:29:48.490
Where the hell did that link go?

00:29:48.490 --> 00:29:50.400
Or, where the hell that button went?

00:29:51.060 --> 00:29:54.300
You need to ensure the navigation
should be consistent.

00:29:54.870 --> 00:29:58.200
Apart from that, in this era or age,
I can say

00:29:59.140 --> 00:30:02.210
mobile users are far more compared

00:30:02.310 --> 00:30:07.080
to someone who is browsing on a desktop,

00:30:07.180 --> 00:30:12.240
be it mobile, be it tablet,
be it any handheld device.

00:30:13.090 --> 00:30:16.120
Those are very popular
nowadays compared to desktop

00:30:16.220 --> 00:30:19.460
when it comes to browsing
or shopping for any product.

00:30:20.260 --> 00:30:23.700
We do have lots of apps as well,
as you all know.

00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:29.200
Making the e-commerce site responsive

00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:31.130
would be a very important part

00:30:31.870 --> 00:30:34.470
when it comes to the accessibility.

00:30:34.740 --> 00:30:38.910
Any users can interact with the website.

00:30:39.010 --> 00:30:44.550
As I said, accessibility is ensuring that

00:30:44.550 --> 00:30:47.150
they can access the site the way they want

00:30:47.790 --> 00:30:50.620
and whichever tool
they want to use, they can.

00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:53.890
Apart from that, resize and reflow.

00:30:53.990 --> 00:30:56.040
When it comes to resize,

00:30:56.350 --> 00:31:00.400
ensuring that your text can resize as per
the zoom level

00:31:00.500 --> 00:31:04.200
that a user is using on
their browsers is also important.

00:31:04.670 --> 00:31:08.370
Someone with a low vision would be unable

00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:11.820
to see the small text
that is placed on the screen.

00:31:12.410 --> 00:31:16.220
They would definitely would want

00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:18.920
to zoom in the screen and understand

00:31:19.020 --> 00:31:21.620
what is all that information about.

00:31:22.590 --> 00:31:25.890
When it comes to reflow again,
you need to ensure

00:31:26.730 --> 00:31:28.430
there is a single columnar view

00:31:28.530 --> 00:31:31.100
available for your e-commerce site.

00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:33.200
Wherein user don't have to use

00:31:33.300 --> 00:31:35.630
like the horizontal scroll bars

00:31:35.730 --> 00:31:37.970
to access the information.

00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:45.310
When it comes to orientation, again,
it's about the mobile devices,

00:31:45.310 --> 00:31:48.010
especially because some people,

00:31:48.810 --> 00:31:50.620
like people who use wheelchair,

00:31:50.650 --> 00:31:54.690
they might want to mount
the devices on the wheelchair

00:31:54.850 --> 00:31:59.260
and maybe to see a larger view,
what they are trying to browse also.

00:31:59.730 --> 00:32:03.130
They would want to orient
the device in a landscape mode.

00:32:03.900 --> 00:32:07.200
If you don't enable that

00:32:07.330 --> 00:32:11.240
orientation in the way
the user wants into a landscape

00:32:11.340 --> 00:32:14.510
or portrait,
it will block them from using your site.

00:32:14.610 --> 00:32:18.480
Because that experience will not be good
and they might go

00:32:18.580 --> 00:32:22.780
to a different e-commerce site
and will lose a customer in that case.

00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:25.850
Having a logical reading order,

00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:29.350
it's all about
like how you read something.

00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:33.630
Like when you're trying to read a story,
you don't necessarily

00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:38.460
start from the initial chapter
and directly jumps to the last one.

00:32:39.030 --> 00:32:42.770
If it was in that manner,
the first, the fourth, and then seven,

00:32:43.340 --> 00:32:45.840
in this manner,
the chapters are placed, you definitely

00:32:45.940 --> 00:32:49.010
won't get the head
and tail of that particular story.

00:32:49.940 --> 00:32:56.550
Ensuring the content order is in logical
way plays an important role

00:32:56.650 --> 00:32:58.530
in your e-commerce site.

00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:02.220
If I take an example
of this screenshot itself,

00:33:02.370 --> 00:33:05.960
it's a cart page, which is having
a product image, the product

00:33:06.060 --> 00:33:10.160
details, the name of the product,
the price, quantity, the subtotal.

00:33:11.030 --> 00:33:14.770
In this case, ensuring that it starts from

00:33:14.970 --> 00:33:18.370
top to bottom and left to right
would be an important thing.

00:33:19.100 --> 00:33:22.540
Otherwise, the information
will not be conveyed in an effective manner.

00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:25.980
Again, it will not be a good experience.

00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:29.620
From an accessibility point of view
as well, it will be a failure.

00:33:33.290 --> 00:33:34.820
Coming to custom elements,

00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:39.490
which Athira was also mentioning earlier,
that you can add custom elements

00:33:39.890 --> 00:33:44.730
and ensure that different interactions
that are there, you can easily develop,

00:33:44.840 --> 00:33:47.030
create on your e-commerce site.

00:33:47.730 --> 00:33:50.770
When it comes to custom elements,
three important things are there,

00:33:50.870 --> 00:33:53.440
name, role, value, when it comes

00:33:53.540 --> 00:33:56.140
to identifying that particular element.

00:33:57.010 --> 00:33:59.610
As you can see, there is a screenshot

00:33:59.980 --> 00:34:03.420
which consists of a tabbed interface code.

00:34:04.980 --> 00:34:07.590
You can basically create any component

00:34:07.990 --> 00:34:11.060
in your customized way
by adding your own code

00:34:11.460 --> 00:34:14.990
and adding your own CSS into it,
and ensure that

00:34:15.460 --> 00:34:17.860
by following the accessibility practices,

00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:20.460
the interaction is accessible.

00:34:21.470 --> 00:34:25.340
Your customized elements
needs to have an accessible name,

00:34:25.500 --> 00:34:28.610
so users can understand
what that element is all about.

00:34:29.070 --> 00:34:31.980
It needs to have a role,
so user can understand

00:34:32.440 --> 00:34:36.950
what action that particular element
will be performing like a button or a tab.

00:34:37.050 --> 00:34:39.620
Button I'll say stick to native.

00:34:39.720 --> 00:34:42.890
Whatever elements are present natively,

00:34:42.990 --> 00:34:45.990
I'll urge to stick
to native implementation,

00:34:46.090 --> 00:34:50.130
because that provides
accessibility out of the box

00:34:50.430 --> 00:34:54.400
and you don't have to fiddle
much around the accessibility of it.

00:34:55.300 --> 00:34:59.470
Yes, when you customize it, role
is an important part, because role tab

00:34:59.640 --> 00:35:02.240
currently it's not in a native format

00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:05.310
but you need to use ARIA in that case.

00:35:06.380 --> 00:35:08.980
Apart from that, required role,

00:35:09.580 --> 00:35:12.720
required states when it comes to tabs

00:35:12.820 --> 00:35:16.020
or checkboxes or even switch controls,

00:35:16.660 --> 00:35:20.430
you need to ensure the state is provided
for the control.

00:35:21.760 --> 00:35:23.230
That can also be given

00:35:23.230 --> 00:35:25.830
by providing a customized HTML.

00:35:27.130 --> 00:35:28.430
It is possible, guys.

00:35:28.530 --> 00:35:30.370
It is not that it is impossible.

00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:31.670
It will take efforts.

00:35:31.670 --> 00:35:34.570
It will take dedication to ensure

00:35:34.670 --> 00:35:38.780
that your e-commerce site is accessible
and it won't happen over the night.

00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:42.810
It will take proper planning
and you can definitely make

00:35:42.920 --> 00:35:44.550
that happen.

00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:47.720
When I say about accessible

00:35:47.720 --> 00:35:51.820
name in my earlier part,
so accessible name

00:35:51.920 --> 00:35:54.930
not only helps describe its purpose,

00:35:55.560 --> 00:35:57.600
it also helps to understand what

00:35:57.600 --> 00:36:00.200
the element is all about.

00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:03.400
This is a very interesting feature

00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:06.310
that most of the browsers provide now.

00:36:06.410 --> 00:36:08.010
It's called accessibility tree.

00:36:08.010 --> 00:36:12.410
It sits in your developer
dev tools in your browsers.

00:36:13.310 --> 00:36:17.280
When you inspect any element,
like when you create something

00:36:18.020 --> 00:36:21.820
in a customized way,
always try to go to an accessibility tree

00:36:22.250 --> 00:36:24.860
and see the computed properties.

00:36:25.260 --> 00:36:27.030
Here you will understand

00:36:27.130 --> 00:36:31.880
what will be the name that
is coming out of that particular element.

00:36:32.020 --> 00:36:34.370
Here we can see
it's add to cart cap,

00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:38.200
because that's what the ARIA label
in this case has given

00:36:38.330 --> 00:36:39.880
to make it more descriptive.

00:36:40.170 --> 00:36:41.570
You can see what is the role.

00:36:41.670 --> 00:36:43.440
Currently it's linked.

00:36:43.540 --> 00:36:45.540
If it's focusable or not,

00:36:45.640 --> 00:36:47.910
it will show you it's true.

00:36:48.010 --> 00:36:50.580
If any additional information is there,

00:36:50.580 --> 00:36:53.190
even that will be shown
in this description.

00:36:53.620 --> 00:36:56.190
You can see
there is an additional description

00:36:56.190 --> 00:37:00.260
provided to it stating bright
yellow cap with adjustable strap,

00:37:00.660 --> 00:37:04.630
offering comfort style
and sun protection for everyday wear.

00:37:06.970 --> 00:37:10.740
Making your elements accessible
by providing

00:37:10.840 --> 00:37:14.810
an accessible name is an important feature
when it comes to accessibility.

00:37:16.110 --> 00:37:21.150
Ensure your elements are not
identically labeled or identically named,

00:37:21.810 --> 00:37:25.520
because it will confuse the user
who is using a screen reader.

00:37:25.620 --> 00:37:29.960
Not only screen reader,
but also someone with mobility impairment

00:37:30.390 --> 00:37:35.930
if they're using a speech
recognition software, like in iOS

00:37:36.030 --> 00:37:40.170
there is voice control or in Android
there is voice access as well.

00:37:40.730 --> 00:37:44.240
If they are trying to use that to interact
with elements on the page,

00:37:44.640 --> 00:37:47.470
they won't be able to reach
where they want

00:37:47.910 --> 00:37:50.640
if all the elements are named
in the same way.

00:37:51.510 --> 00:37:55.650
A minute differentiator needs to be there

00:37:55.850 --> 00:37:58.450
to make it more descriptive.

00:38:00.850 --> 00:38:06.020
Apart from that,
I'll also say it needs to be not ambiguous,

00:38:06.150 --> 00:38:07.530
it needs to be descriptive

00:38:07.790 --> 00:38:10.800
so that user can understand
the purpose of that particular element.

00:38:13.470 --> 00:38:15.600
Coming to keyboard navigation,

00:38:15.700 --> 00:38:18.300
some part of it Athira has already covered

00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:21.010
with regards to navigation and so on.

00:38:22.810 --> 00:38:25.980
Remember a few things
when it comes to keyboard navigation

00:38:26.110 --> 00:38:28.710
and you're adding
something on your WooCommerce site,

00:38:28.880 --> 00:38:33.550
it needs to be reachable
when using a tab key or any input device.

00:38:34.390 --> 00:38:35.990
It needs to be operable.

00:38:36.090 --> 00:38:39.260
Basically when you press any space bar

00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:42.830
or an enter key
on any particular interactive element,

00:38:43.100 --> 00:38:47.030
it needs to function something,
it needs to action out the event.

00:38:48.600 --> 00:38:51.870
Also using a mouse device,
it needs to action out the same event

00:38:52.170 --> 00:38:54.770
or any switch devices as well.

00:38:55.740 --> 00:38:58.340
It needs to have a visual focus indicator.

00:38:59.140 --> 00:39:01.850
In the second screenshot, as you can see,

00:39:01.950 --> 00:39:05.220
this is one of the theme
that is of WooCommerce itself.

00:39:06.050 --> 00:39:07.890
It is having a focus indicator,

00:39:07.890 --> 00:39:13.860
which is a purple color border,
I can say, which is distinctly visible.

00:39:14.090 --> 00:39:17.400
As soon as my focus lands
on that particular element,

00:39:17.500 --> 00:39:18.860
it will be a border of purple color,

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:23.500
so I know where my current focus
is on with the keyboard.

00:39:24.440 --> 00:39:27.140
Also following a logical focus order.

00:39:27.710 --> 00:39:30.310
In case of header, main and footer,

00:39:30.840 --> 00:39:33.450
there would be lots
of interactive elements.

00:39:34.080 --> 00:39:36.880
Visually,
if they are in a particular order,

00:39:37.420 --> 00:39:41.690
it needs to receive the keyboard focus
also in that particular order.

00:39:42.190 --> 00:39:44.790
If you break that focus order,

00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:49.160
it will break the semantics

00:39:49.160 --> 00:39:53.830
because user will be confused
that they are jumping all over the page.

00:39:54.300 --> 00:39:56.900
They're not going in a logical sequence.

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:01.040
When it comes to focus order
and reading order,

00:40:01.140 --> 00:40:04.580
it needs to be from left to right
and top to bottom.

00:40:04.980 --> 00:40:07.550
Always remember that.

00:40:08.050 --> 00:40:11.520
Now coming to focus management,
how we can forget

00:40:11.620 --> 00:40:15.590
the dynamic interactions that are there
in most of the e-commerce site.

00:40:16.620 --> 00:40:21.330
Whenever there are dynamic interaction,
focus management plays an important role.

00:40:22.360 --> 00:40:25.100
Be it adding something to your cart.

00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:29.200
I have seen some of the e-commerce site
when you add some product to your cart,

00:40:29.700 --> 00:40:33.040
my focus would jump directly
to that particular cart

00:40:33.540 --> 00:40:36.510
icon wherein
the quantity keeps on increasing.

00:40:37.780 --> 00:40:39.980
Why would you want to do that?

00:40:40.080 --> 00:40:42.880
You can easily just announce that

00:40:43.580 --> 00:40:46.520
interaction by saying, okay, one

00:40:46.820 --> 00:40:49.880
product added to the cart
via live region.

00:40:50.920 --> 00:40:53.730
These small things can help

00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:57.000
make your e-commerce site more accessible.

00:40:57.630 --> 00:41:01.300
Don't shift the focus out of the context.

00:41:01.770 --> 00:41:06.070
If it is really needed in certain cases,
you can shift it.

00:41:06.240 --> 00:41:08.540
For example,
when it comes to modal dialog,

00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:11.080
when you're invoking a modal dialog,

00:41:11.180 --> 00:41:14.750
your focus will shift inside that dialog,
which is really important.

00:41:15.350 --> 00:41:19.150
I have seen even that is not done properly
in some of the e-commerce site.

00:41:20.820 --> 00:41:22.690
When you have to do it, you must do it,

00:41:22.690 --> 00:41:25.290
but don't do it
in each and every interaction.

00:41:30.300 --> 00:41:33.970
Again, when it comes to e-commerce site,
how can we forget the forms?

00:41:34.700 --> 00:41:38.100
So in WooCommerce,
you can create or I can say WordPress

00:41:38.200 --> 00:41:39.620
also gives that feature,

00:41:39.710 --> 00:41:42.330
where you can add
different types of forms.

00:41:42.510 --> 00:41:46.680
I'm taking an example of simple contact
form where you have

00:41:47.380 --> 00:41:49.980
name, email, message field

00:41:50.520 --> 00:41:52.820
in this particular screenshot as well.

00:41:52.920 --> 00:41:55.890
In the left-hand side,
you can basically customize

00:41:55.990 --> 00:41:59.060
the label of it,
the format that you want it to be in.

00:41:59.690 --> 00:42:02.290
If I need additional description
you want to provide,

00:42:02.660 --> 00:42:05.750
and if you want to make it
a required thing.

00:42:06.910 --> 00:42:10.240
In many of the cases,
if you can see currently

00:42:10.370 --> 00:42:14.840
on this particular form itself,
the star is indicating something.

00:42:15.550 --> 00:42:18.600
In majorly most of the cases it indicates

00:42:18.730 --> 00:42:21.450
it's a required field,
but what about the instruction?

00:42:22.110 --> 00:42:24.720
Like what does that star stands for?

00:42:25.020 --> 00:42:27.590
So you can see
that is missing in this particular case.

00:42:27.690 --> 00:42:30.890
So that is something you will have
to manually add in this case.

00:42:32.420 --> 00:42:34.530
When it comes to visually labeled control,

00:42:34.530 --> 00:42:37.260
ensure
this label field is accurately filled.

00:42:38.300 --> 00:42:40.900
That will help provide
a visual label as well

00:42:41.500 --> 00:42:44.070
and that will help
you meet that requirement.

00:42:44.170 --> 00:42:46.140
Fortunately, you can easily

00:42:46.310 --> 00:42:51.440
associate your label through this,
and when it comes to different controls,

00:42:51.660 --> 00:42:53.880
you need to also ensure it is grouped.

00:42:55.380 --> 00:42:58.580
Ensuring there are important
visual cues given

00:42:58.720 --> 00:43:02.990
when it comes to multi-form step forms,
it needs to correctly,

00:43:03.960 --> 00:43:06.730
like not give out the progress
of that particular step.

00:43:07.590 --> 00:43:09.330
Step one, two, three, and so on.

00:43:11.550 --> 00:43:13.350
Another important thing when

00:43:13.480 --> 00:43:15.570
it comes to forms is you need to allow

00:43:15.670 --> 00:43:19.770
time to extend the session
in case where it's really required.

00:43:20.610 --> 00:43:24.180
Don't log out user abruptly

00:43:24.480 --> 00:43:27.050
when it's not needed.

00:43:29.110 --> 00:43:32.550
Dynamic interactions
I've somewhat already spoken about.

00:43:32.650 --> 00:43:34.590
I'll just talk about live region

00:43:34.590 --> 00:43:38.460
because when there are important feedbacks
that needs to be given,

00:43:38.790 --> 00:43:41.390
it needs to be given in accessible
way as well.

00:43:41.890 --> 00:43:44.860
Some of these dynamic messages
could be like,

00:43:45.100 --> 00:43:47.730
as you can see some of the example,
like you are being warned

00:43:47.830 --> 00:43:51.540
or just information
that needs to be given or success

00:43:51.640 --> 00:43:54.670
your product has been bought, or something
along those lines.

00:43:55.340 --> 00:43:57.940
Even that needs to be accessible,

00:43:58.210 --> 00:44:02.370
by just making it appear
on the screen won't help.

00:44:05.150 --> 00:44:08.320
When it comes to multimedia also,
WooCommerce

00:44:08.420 --> 00:44:11.760
or WordPress allows you to add captions.

00:44:11.960 --> 00:44:14.530
It allows you to add subtitles

00:44:14.590 --> 00:44:17.700
when you try to
upload any particular video.

00:44:19.200 --> 00:44:21.030
Ensure you do that,

00:44:21.130 --> 00:44:24.270
because it will really help
people who are deaf,

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:28.840
who cannot hear the audio
of that particular video.

00:44:29.270 --> 00:44:32.440
It will help them to understand
the context

00:44:32.540 --> 00:44:34.550
of that particular video.

00:44:37.720 --> 00:44:40.220
Testing and how to improve WooCommerce,

00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:44.240
this will be covered in short by Athira.

00:44:46.330 --> 00:44:47.660
Athira: Sure.

00:44:48.790 --> 00:44:50.440
Thank you Fahad for that.

00:44:51.630 --> 00:44:54.170
Before any product
reaches to the end user,

00:44:54.270 --> 00:44:58.140
we must ensure that the design aligns
with accessibility standard.

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:02.510
Either you can provide a screenshot
of your website that you're about

00:45:02.610 --> 00:45:05.210
to create or a Figma design

00:45:05.480 --> 00:45:08.080
before implementing it
to the production team.

00:45:09.050 --> 00:45:11.650
That will reduce the cost effects

00:45:11.820 --> 00:45:15.250
and also improve the accessibility
from the start itself.

00:45:16.120 --> 00:45:18.820
-Sherose: I'm sorry, Athira?
-Athira: Yeah.

00:45:18.910 --> 00:45:21.730
Sherose: I'm sorry to interrupt,
but we're super short on time.

00:45:21.830 --> 00:45:24.330
We have five minutes
and the audience has a ton of questions.

00:45:24.330 --> 00:45:26.830
Would it be all right
if I switch to the questions instead?

00:45:26.930 --> 00:45:29.220
Athira: Yeah, sure, sure.
Sherose:Thank you, Athira and Fahad.

00:45:29.310 --> 00:45:30.130
Thanks so much.

00:45:30.220 --> 00:45:32.370
You have a very comprehensive
presentation today.

00:45:32.470 --> 00:45:34.370
I'll get started with the first question.

00:45:34.470 --> 00:45:38.980
Is there a benefit to having a WooCommerce
store on a dedicated subdomain

00:45:39.280 --> 00:45:42.060
as opposed to just part
of the main domain?

00:45:45.480 --> 00:45:46.380
Fahad: Yeah.

00:45:46.420 --> 00:45:50.120
I'll say rather than having
in a subdomain,

00:45:50.220 --> 00:45:52.820
it would be better
to have it on the main domain,

00:45:53.290 --> 00:45:57.330
because it will help to ensure
that the integration

00:45:57.430 --> 00:46:00.570
is smooth across your subdomains,
rather than

00:46:02.900 --> 00:46:05.600
having it on the subdomain separately.

00:46:06.660 --> 00:46:08.110
Sherose: Thank you.

00:46:08.210 --> 00:46:09.470
Next question.

00:46:09.570 --> 00:46:12.880
Do you have experience
with any of the other e-commerce plugins

00:46:12.980 --> 00:46:15.750
for WordPress
or alternate platforms like Shopify?

00:46:16.450 --> 00:46:20.550
And what is your opinion
on how accessibility

00:46:20.650 --> 00:46:23.150
in WooCommerce compares to that?

00:46:24.320 --> 00:46:25.320
Fahad: Okay.

00:46:25.420 --> 00:46:29.030
So that's a good question
because I do have experience

00:46:29.130 --> 00:46:30.860
with certain Shopify sites.

00:46:30.860 --> 00:46:33.700
Also, some sites are built using Shopify.

00:46:34.230 --> 00:46:40.340
I'll say Shopify is something currently,
as per my experience, I will say,

00:46:40.440 --> 00:46:43.340
is not giving that much accessibility
out of the box.

00:46:44.280 --> 00:46:49.180
There are a lot of things
that needs to be manually done.

00:46:50.150 --> 00:46:54.490
While doing that,
I'm sure you will forget

00:46:54.590 --> 00:46:57.190
some of the other thing
when it comes to ensuring,

00:46:57.590 --> 00:46:59.880
implementing accessibility over there.

00:47:01.490 --> 00:47:04.700
Because it also depends
on how you're creating that Shopify

00:47:04.800 --> 00:47:08.830
website with different liquid themes
that are there.

00:47:09.270 --> 00:47:11.800
So it all depends on that as well.

00:47:12.900 --> 00:47:14.070
Sherose: Thank you.

00:47:14.170 --> 00:47:17.110
We know
WordPress is committed to accessibility,

00:47:17.210 --> 00:47:23.580
so the expectation is that WooCommerce
would be accessible out of the box.

00:47:24.120 --> 00:47:29.950
The question is, are there any major
or common accessibility issues

00:47:30.320 --> 00:47:32.350
with WooCommerce either out of the box

00:47:32.460 --> 00:47:35.290
or in typical WooCommerce sites?

00:47:36.550 --> 00:47:37.440
Fahad: Yeah.

00:47:37.510 --> 00:47:41.840
So in the initial part
of the presentation,

00:47:41.950 --> 00:47:45.370
we did mention about some of the challenges
that are there currently,

00:47:46.070 --> 00:47:48.040
which needs to be manually looked after.

00:47:48.140 --> 00:47:50.740
For example,
the error messages that are there,

00:47:51.010 --> 00:47:54.250
they are not necessarily out of the box,
very descriptive.

00:47:54.850 --> 00:47:57.320
If you want to make them more descriptive,

00:47:57.420 --> 00:48:00.180
that you have to do it
manually at the back end.

00:48:00.440 --> 00:48:01.660
Apart from that,

00:48:01.820 --> 00:48:05.660
not every theme will give you skip links,

00:48:06.110 --> 00:48:08.530
so that also is something
you can manually add

00:48:08.660 --> 00:48:09.990
to your theme later on.

00:48:10.090 --> 00:48:13.900
Because I'll say it is not a mandate
to have a skip link,

00:48:14.270 --> 00:48:18.100
but it is really a good user experience
when there are skip links on the page.

00:48:18.900 --> 00:48:22.340
One last thing I will also say is,
when it comes to alt text,

00:48:23.010 --> 00:48:25.380
it is not enforced how Athira was saying,

00:48:25.530 --> 00:48:27.950
because it is not a required
field currently.

00:48:28.250 --> 00:48:32.120
You can just go away with it
and then there should be an option to,

00:48:32.650 --> 00:48:36.790
I'm sure you must have used Word
or PPT as well.

00:48:37.190 --> 00:48:41.160
They have an option to make it decorative
or you can add an alt text for that.

00:48:41.690 --> 00:48:43.900
Maybe some kind of that feature will help

00:48:43.970 --> 00:48:47.670
to make a conscious decision
on the images as well.

00:48:48.910 --> 00:48:50.300
Sherose: Thank you.

00:48:50.400 --> 00:48:53.440
We have a minute and a half
and I want to ask two questions.

00:48:53.810 --> 00:48:57.110
One, what are your tips for conforming

00:48:57.210 --> 00:49:00.650
to EN 301549,

00:49:00.750 --> 00:49:04.180
a European accessibility
law that stretches beyond WCAG?

00:49:04.920 --> 00:49:07.090
And if you could very briefly

00:49:07.190 --> 00:49:09.490
recommend specific tools and methodologies

00:49:09.490 --> 00:49:13.060
that you find most effective
for auditing WooCommerce sites.

00:49:13.220 --> 00:49:14.950
We have about two minutes.

00:49:15.400 --> 00:49:19.800
Fahad: Yeah. So I will say when
it comes to EN 301549 also,

00:49:21.200 --> 00:49:26.240
you need to ensure
you're conforming to WCAG 2.1 standard.

00:49:26.340 --> 00:49:31.640
Beyond that,
if you are to go, you can use your device

00:49:31.880 --> 00:49:35.510
accessibility features
that are there, a high contrast mode,

00:49:35.850 --> 00:49:39.350
or even magnifiers
that are there on your OS.

00:49:39.750 --> 00:49:42.690
You need to ensure that it supports
that as well

00:49:42.790 --> 00:49:46.190
because sometimes e-commerce sites
are also web applications.

00:49:46.790 --> 00:49:50.130
In that case,
you need to adhere to that.

00:49:51.640 --> 00:49:55.530
Sherose: Then are there specific tools
that you would recommend or some that

00:49:56.860 --> 00:49:59.350
your company BarrierBreak uses frequently?

00:50:00.460 --> 00:50:02.640
Fahad:
When it comes to reviewing

00:50:02.740 --> 00:50:05.640
the theme, I can say
when you are trying to select a theme,

00:50:05.940 --> 00:50:08.950
there is one great tool freely
available called Andy.

00:50:09.510 --> 00:50:13.820
You can definitely use that
because that's free and very easy to use.

00:50:13.920 --> 00:50:17.620
It has different modules to select from
and it will give you some automated

00:50:17.720 --> 00:50:21.910
results and some guidance as well,
so you can definitely use that.

00:50:22.930 --> 00:50:24.530
Sherose: I use Andy.
I'm familiar with it.

00:50:24.530 --> 00:50:26.730
That's a bookmark that you could put.

00:50:26.830 --> 00:50:29.430
I like to use Chrome,
so I have it on my Chrome bar.

00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:33.340
Andy will review your site
and give you results

00:50:33.440 --> 00:50:37.110
at the very top of your browser,
and then you can select different tabs

00:50:37.410 --> 00:50:41.660
that are labeled and color-coded,
right?

00:50:41.710 --> 00:50:42.970
Fahad: Correct.
Sherose: That you can see

00:50:43.110 --> 00:50:44.600
different portions of the website.

00:50:44.850 --> 00:50:46.550
Thank you so much for your time.

00:50:46.550 --> 00:50:48.190
I feel like there's so much more
we can discuss.

00:50:48.280 --> 00:50:50.420
We have a ton of questions in the chat,

00:50:50.530 --> 00:50:52.880
so please join there and see
if you can answer some.

00:50:53.280 --> 00:50:55.630
Athira and Fahad, thank you again.

00:50:55.730 --> 00:50:57.730
Thank you for attending this session.

00:50:57.830 --> 00:51:00.700

We have one more session for y'all.

00:51:24.660 --> 00:51:27.830
Maintaining your site's accessibility
well after launch,

00:51:28.030 --> 00:51:30.730
and this will be presented
by Jeanette Stair, an accessibility

00:51:30.830 --> 00:51:34.170
