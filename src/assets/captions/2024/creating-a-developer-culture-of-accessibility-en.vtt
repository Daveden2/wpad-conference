<v Announcer>
WordPress Accessibility Day 2024.

00:00:04.322 --> 00:00:07.240
Creating a developer culture
of accessibility

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:08.824
with speaker, Mark Steadman,

00:00:08.844 --> 00:00:12.382
Director of Accessibility Engineering
at Fidelity Investments.

00:00:12.533 --> 00:00:15.983
This presentation
was recorded October 2024.

00:00:16.566 --> 00:00:19.428
<v Piccia Neri> Welcome to
WordPress Accessibility Day 2024.

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:22.395
If you've just joined,
my name is Piccia Neri,

00:00:22.415 --> 00:00:27.318
and I'm a UX and Accessibility Designer.

00:00:27.508 --> 00:00:29.563
Thank you for joining us
for the next session,

00:00:29.583 --> 00:00:35.015
which is Creating a Developer Culture
of Accessibility,

00:00:35.123 --> 00:00:39.537
with Jessie Frio, I hope
I've pronounced it correctly, Jessie,

00:00:39.557 --> 00:00:41.687
and Mark Steadman.

00:00:41.786 --> 00:00:46.142
Jessie is an Accessibility Engineer
at Fidelity Investments,

00:00:46.162 --> 00:00:48.632
with experience in accessible development

00:00:48.658 --> 00:00:50.267
and consultation

00:00:50.287 --> 00:00:53.379
with both web and mobile teams.

00:00:53.511 --> 00:00:58.377
Her passion is to ensure that
all users can independently access

00:00:58.401 --> 00:01:03.855
all digital content
through exceptional user experience.

00:01:04.457 --> 00:01:09.207
Mark Steadman is
the Director of Accessibility Engineering

00:01:09.227 --> 00:01:10.871
at Fidelity Investments,

00:01:10.972 --> 00:01:14.257
with a passion
for accessibility automation,

00:01:14.336 --> 00:01:19.009
developer advocacy for accessibility,
and an overall mission to make

00:01:19.078 --> 00:01:23.263
all content on the web
and mobile accessible for all.

00:01:23.459 --> 00:01:27.410
Mark's main focus has been working
with development teams

00:01:27.504 --> 00:01:30.992
to prioritize accessibility
in continuous development

00:01:31.012 --> 00:01:33.343
and continuous integration environments,

00:01:33.384 --> 00:01:36.752
and creating automated
accessibility solutions

00:01:36.772 --> 00:01:39.510
for development teams and organizations.

00:01:39.538 --> 00:01:41.358
Now, I know I always say this,

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.460
but I am, once again,
really looking forward to this,

00:01:44.482 --> 00:01:47.206
because it's so important
to create a culture

00:01:47.226 --> 00:01:50.426
where everyone
is invested in accessibility.

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.014
Over to you, Jessie and Mark,
and thank you so much for being here.

00:01:58.237 --> 00:01:59.988
Mark Steadman: There we go.
Awesome.

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:00.972
All right.

00:02:00.992 --> 00:02:05.750
Well, like I always say with any talk,
this 24-hours talk, I have to say,

00:02:05.779 --> 00:02:08.798
good morning, good evening,
good afternoon, good night,

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.625
wherever you are
in the entire world, welcome.

00:02:12.184 --> 00:02:15.154
For Jessie and myself,
we're in the good old United States,

00:02:15.174 --> 00:02:17.776
and it is 5:00 AM for me
and 6:00 AM for Jessie,

00:02:17.796 --> 00:02:21.717
so we are probably hyped up on coffee
and way too much caffeine.

00:02:21.867 --> 00:02:24.446
If we go through this in 15 minutes,
that's probably why.

00:02:26.346 --> 00:02:30.912
Welcome, everybody, to creating
a developer culture of accessibility.

00:02:32.312 --> 00:02:34.313
Again, we already had a dope intro,

00:02:34.333 --> 00:02:37.905
so we should probably just do it
really simple, Jessie, as we go through.

00:02:37.965 --> 00:02:40.492
Just real quick, I'm Mark Steadman,
Director of Accessibility Engineering.

00:02:40.512 --> 00:02:42.556
I'm with Fidelity Investments.

00:02:43.117 --> 00:02:47.761
Jessie: I'm Jessie,
and I am also with Fidelity Investments.

00:02:47.926 --> 00:02:48.926
<v Mark> You don't need to know anymore.

00:02:48.946 --> 00:02:50.383
We already have the dope intro for us,

00:02:50.404 --> 00:02:52.419
-so we'll just leave it at that.
-Jessie: Yes, [?] took

00:02:52.439 --> 00:02:53.997
everything I was going to say.

00:02:55.383 --> 00:02:57.561
<v Mark> Yes, so easy peasy.

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.951
Let's talk through today's agenda

00:02:59.971 --> 00:03:02.322
because it's really important
to understand

00:03:02.342 --> 00:03:05.040
where we're going to start
and where we're going to go

00:03:05.645 --> 00:03:08.263
as we go through this entire presentation.

00:03:08.416 --> 00:03:10.517
Our agenda today is talk through
what culture is.

00:03:10.537 --> 00:03:12.298
We have to get an understanding
for what it is

00:03:12.318 --> 00:03:15.650
before we can start going through
how to make a culture switch

00:03:15.683 --> 00:03:17.813
from one that
doesn't include accessibility

00:03:17.833 --> 00:03:19.319
to one that does.

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:24.594
The overall problem, the ultimate goal,
and how do we get to that ultimate goal,

00:03:24.614 --> 00:03:25.860
the way to get there,

00:03:25.881 --> 00:03:28.679
and the way to actually
get us to a culture

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:30.816
that is accessible.

00:03:32.192 --> 00:03:35.578
Starting out, we have to start like
we're in high school again.

00:03:35.598 --> 00:03:38.420
We have to do an introduction for
what is culture.

00:03:38.441 --> 00:03:40.524
Jessie, I'll let you take it away.

00:03:40.805 --> 00:03:41.805
Jessie: Awesome.

00:03:42.321 --> 00:03:45.750
We didn't want to talk about
creating a culture of accessibility

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:47.656
without defining culture.

00:03:47.676 --> 00:03:50.535
Culture is a little bit
of an ambiguous term.

00:03:50.558 --> 00:03:51.947
Everyone's heard it,

00:03:51.967 --> 00:03:56.181
but I doubt
anyone has ever tried to define it.

00:03:56.201 --> 00:03:58.904
So we took a stab at it.

00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:02.942
Broadly,
culture is the complex set of beliefs,

00:04:02.973 --> 00:04:06.133
values, behaviors, and practices

00:04:06.153 --> 00:04:09.096
that define a group of people or society.

00:04:09.157 --> 00:04:12.137
It influences who we are and what we do,

00:04:12.157 --> 00:04:15.722
the way we make decisions
and rationalize our behaviors.

00:04:16.146 --> 00:04:20.126
It's important, especially for our talk,
to note that it's always changing.

00:04:20.146 --> 00:04:24.776
It's not something that's set in stone
or that we're ever stuck with.

00:04:26.193 --> 00:04:28.449
Then to get more specific,

00:04:28.567 --> 00:04:33.963
the culture of an organization,
or for our purposes, a development team,

00:04:34.177 --> 00:04:38.548
is a set of shared attitudes,
values, goals, and practices

00:04:38.568 --> 00:04:40.378
that characterize the group.

00:04:40.863 --> 00:04:45.683
Here, culture has a hand
in defining the team's values and purpose,

00:04:45.743 --> 00:04:51.134
in setting the team's expectations,
and in defining core values.

00:04:53.073 --> 00:04:54.005
<v Mark> Right on.

00:04:54.026 --> 00:04:57.142
Now that we have
an awesome definition,

00:04:57.363 --> 00:04:59.174
two definitions of culture,

00:04:59.434 --> 00:05:01.167
we have to get to dive
into the juicy stuff,

00:05:01.187 --> 00:05:02.257
which is,

00:05:02.641 --> 00:05:04.225
what is the overall problem?

00:05:04.269 --> 00:05:08.263
Obviously, we're here because
we have a problem to talk about, right?

00:05:08.297 --> 00:05:13.030
But there is a big problem, in general,
with trying to switch a culture from

00:05:13.396 --> 00:05:17.747
accessibility is too difficult to
we build content accessibly.

00:05:17.767 --> 00:05:22.209
Now, some of you on here probably heard
development teams say to you,

00:05:22.622 --> 00:05:24.561
"We build content accessibly."

00:05:24.635 --> 00:05:25.649
We do.

00:05:25.801 --> 00:05:27.614
Do they really?

00:05:27.755 --> 00:05:31.150
Do you need to handhold them
to get them to that point, right?

00:05:31.357 --> 00:05:33.187
We have to remember that

00:05:33.207 --> 00:05:35.673
doing this and getting culture shifted

00:05:35.693 --> 00:05:39.590
from the it's too hard
to we do content accessibly

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:40.763
is a long process.

00:05:41.051 --> 00:05:43.543
What is the problem right now
in getting there?

00:05:45.507 --> 00:05:46.989
Let's start with development teams.

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:48.058
We know the stigma.

00:05:48.126 --> 00:05:50.856
Accessibility causes friction,
and it slows everything down.

00:05:51.972 --> 00:05:53.026
It's too difficult.

00:05:53.199 --> 00:05:54.222
That's the number one thing.

00:05:54.243 --> 00:05:55.762
Hey, you're coming in here.

00:05:55.782 --> 00:05:57.532
You're telling me how to do my processes.

00:05:57.552 --> 00:05:59.339
You're telling me
I have to change all this stuff up.

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:00.319
I've got to do audits.

00:06:00.344 --> 00:06:01.311
I've got to do this.

00:06:01.332 --> 00:06:02.362
I've got to get to these things.

00:06:02.385 --> 00:06:03.932
I've got to do automation.

00:06:04.045 --> 00:06:05.117
I can't keep up.

00:06:07.057 --> 00:06:09.136
There's some truth to that, honestly.

00:06:09.497 --> 00:06:12.254
I'm a person
that was on a development team

00:06:12.274 --> 00:06:16.015
and was that exact same person
who said, "This is too difficult.

00:06:16.035 --> 00:06:17.276
You're going to make me do all this stuff.

00:06:17.296 --> 00:06:18.869
I can't do all this."

00:06:20.778 --> 00:06:22.425
In reality, we all know
that's not the case.

00:06:22.445 --> 00:06:24.357
We can easily fit into processes
and do that.

00:06:24.377 --> 00:06:26.720
But that's the problem right now
is that the stigma out there is

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:28.408
that it's too difficult.

00:06:28.563 --> 00:06:30.617
The other one is business priorities.

00:06:30.731 --> 00:06:32.252
Think about it like this.

00:06:33.276 --> 00:06:36.173
Everyone always tends to think
that the business priority is

00:06:36.193 --> 00:06:38.274
that something new comes in
and accessibility gets put aside.

00:06:38.294 --> 00:06:41.039
Actually, most organizations,
most development teams,

00:06:41.059 --> 00:06:43.105
honestly, they do want to do good.

00:06:43.382 --> 00:06:47.039
The problem is they see that good
as not a necessary business value.

00:06:47.059 --> 00:06:49.068
They see it as a nice to have.

00:06:49.248 --> 00:06:51.468
If we can get to it, we'll get to it.

00:06:51.508 --> 00:06:52.869
It's a nice to have.

00:06:53.382 --> 00:06:54.978
The last one is moving goalposts.

00:06:54.998 --> 00:06:58.450
Kind of back to the first part
about accessibility is too difficult.

00:06:58.502 --> 00:06:59.601
When you say moving goalposts,

00:06:59.621 --> 00:07:03.715
we're moving the target
to say over and over again,

00:07:03.783 --> 00:07:05.968
"Yes, it's accessible,
but you forgot about this.

00:07:05.988 --> 00:07:07.523
You forgot about this."

00:07:08.083 --> 00:07:11.652
Accessibility teams constantly think
that the target is moving.

00:07:11.678 --> 00:07:13.228
When in reality, it's probably just

00:07:13.248 --> 00:07:15.979
an accessibility advocate like myself
or Jessie saying like,

00:07:15.999 --> 00:07:17.103
"Hey, you're almost there.

00:07:17.137 --> 00:07:18.358
We just need to do a couple more things."

00:07:18.378 --> 00:07:20.700
But to them, not knowing accessibility,

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:25.150
they see it as it's never-ending,
that goalpost is moving,

00:07:25.239 --> 00:07:27.906
and are we ever going to get there.

00:07:29.889 --> 00:07:31.306
Everybody listening to me talk right now

00:07:31.326 --> 00:07:33.273
has probably heard developers,
development teams,

00:07:33.293 --> 00:07:36.497
whether it's through a CMS,

00:07:36.517 --> 00:07:38.982
straight development like React,
Angular, whoever it is,

00:07:39.002 --> 00:07:41.712
you've probably already heard
all these things be said.

00:07:41.979 --> 00:07:45.508
However, I'm going to flip something
the other way around as well

00:07:45.787 --> 00:07:48.875
because it isn't just development teams
that are the problem.

00:07:49.115 --> 00:07:52.539
Hi, Accessibility teams
are the problem, too.

00:07:52.627 --> 00:07:53.684
Yes,

00:07:53.897 --> 00:07:57.290
Accessibility advocates like me,
like Jessie,

00:07:57.317 --> 00:07:59.273
like everybody probably
listening to this call,

00:07:59.293 --> 00:08:01.886
we do have an issue in this process, too.

00:08:02.108 --> 00:08:04.694
The stigma for Accessibility teams
normally is

00:08:04.714 --> 00:08:06.227
this is how we have to do it.

00:08:06.936 --> 00:08:09.428
The old-school way of audits.

00:08:09.454 --> 00:08:10.478
I got to audit it.

00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:13.117
I got to send it to teams
and they got to fix it.

00:08:13.317 --> 00:08:16.736
I need to make a blanket way
for teams to adopt something

00:08:16.756 --> 00:08:18.469
and that's how we have to do it.

00:08:19.212 --> 00:08:20.629
It's not wrong.

00:08:20.649 --> 00:08:22.199
We've been doing it for years.

00:08:22.219 --> 00:08:23.788
A lot of organizations scale in that way.

00:08:23.808 --> 00:08:26.175
Development teams pick it up in that way.

00:08:27.735 --> 00:08:30.173
Really, the problem comes into

00:08:30.193 --> 00:08:33.150
there's no adaption
to development team processes.

00:08:33.852 --> 00:08:35.993
If you take away anything from this,
if you're not a developer,

00:08:36.013 --> 00:08:38.394
not familiar with development processes,
you have to understand

00:08:38.414 --> 00:08:43.622
development teams have a load of things
that they do every single day.

00:08:43.712 --> 00:08:47.735
From straight development, code reviews,

00:08:47.914 --> 00:08:49.484
security reviews, test reviews,

00:08:49.504 --> 00:08:51.883
UI testing,
all the pieces that go into it.

00:08:51.904 --> 00:08:53.400
There are a ton of processes

00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:55.600
and just saying,
"Hey, go do Accessibility,"

00:08:55.717 --> 00:08:57.799
is going to make them
resistant to it immediately

00:08:57.847 --> 00:09:00.823
unless we look at it and figure out
how we can fit it in nicely.

00:09:00.901 --> 00:09:02.908
There's no guidance
that's easily consumable.

00:09:02.928 --> 00:09:06.627
When we say guidance, there's no guidance
into implementation for some of the tools.

00:09:07.144 --> 00:09:09.347
There's not really a good plethora
of guidance into

00:09:09.367 --> 00:09:11.610
how to fix some of the issues
on their own.

00:09:12.235 --> 00:09:13.430
A lot of them are relatively simple,

00:09:13.451 --> 00:09:16.044
but like on their own
fixing some of the issues,

00:09:16.327 --> 00:09:18.862
there's no enforcement
at development level.

00:09:19.443 --> 00:09:23.128
We'll get into this one a little bit more
before I go into a deep dive about this,

00:09:23.148 --> 00:09:26.545
but having enforcement
as an Accessibility team is saying,

00:09:26.565 --> 00:09:30.727
"Hey, we want to enforce Accessibility
at a development level

00:09:30.747 --> 00:09:33.707
and ensure that developers
are fixing issues

00:09:33.727 --> 00:09:34.678
before they're released."

00:09:34.698 --> 00:09:37.108
Not after, not waiting for an audit.

00:09:37.368 --> 00:09:39.260
We want to make sure they're fixed

00:09:39.452 --> 00:09:41.998
before that at a development level,

00:09:42.055 --> 00:09:43.771
but we [?] do that right now.

00:09:43.899 --> 00:09:45.498
The last one is
throwing everything all at once.

00:09:45.518 --> 00:09:48.449
Now, sometimes this is the last bullet
I had on here

00:09:48.469 --> 00:09:50.032
because it is what it is.

00:09:50.052 --> 00:09:53.246
Sometimes we're starting programs
or we're working with development teams

00:09:53.266 --> 00:09:56.676
and we're under such pressure
to get Accessibility involved.

00:09:56.696 --> 00:09:57.917
We throw everything at them
all at once and say,

00:09:57.945 --> 00:10:00.009
"Hey, we've got to get this stuff done."

00:10:00.798 --> 00:10:01.633
Does it last?

00:10:01.653 --> 00:10:04.938
Does it make a culture
of developing stuff Accessibly?

00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:06.932
It doesn't.
It might stick for a little bit,

00:10:06.952 --> 00:10:09.112
but it doesn't stick in the long term.

00:10:09.459 --> 00:10:11.669
Those are our two big problems.

00:10:11.689 --> 00:10:14.641
We have development teams
that holistically think

00:10:14.678 --> 00:10:17.787
that Accessibility is too difficult
at a very high level.

00:10:17.807 --> 00:10:19.581
We have Accessibility teams

00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:22.231
that kind of say,
"Hey, this is how we have to do it.

00:10:22.251 --> 00:10:24.451
We've got to start
doing Accessibility early.

00:10:24.484 --> 00:10:27.550
We've got to shift left
and we've got to get there."

00:10:28.279 --> 00:10:31.763
Doing those things and saying
those things are two different things.

00:10:32.617 --> 00:10:34.635
We want to get to a state

00:10:34.808 --> 00:10:37.515
where we are able
to address both these problems.

00:10:37.779 --> 00:10:40.743
The way that we do that
is working through culture.

00:10:41.388 --> 00:10:45.700
What is the ultimate goal, Jessie?

00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:50.695
Oh, you're on mute, though.

00:10:54.462 --> 00:10:56.117
Jessie: All right. It had to happen once.

00:10:56.138 --> 00:10:57.795
We got that out of the way.

00:10:58.570 --> 00:11:02.285
All right. So like Mark mentioned,

00:11:02.349 --> 00:11:04.830
we have to move from a culture

00:11:05.777 --> 00:11:08.977
from Accessibility
and new processes slow us down

00:11:09.023 --> 00:11:12.797
to we create content
with Accessibility in mind.

00:11:13.377 --> 00:11:16.108
So we have to move
Accessibility from something

00:11:16.128 --> 00:11:19.521
that's a nice to have,
if we can get to it,

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:21.141
a one-and-done,

00:11:21.279 --> 00:11:25.573
a we fixed Accessibility last year,

00:11:25.688 --> 00:11:28.270
to something that's thought of
by developers

00:11:28.290 --> 00:11:30.275
and teams every single day.

00:11:30.328 --> 00:11:32.545
That's where we want
to bring Accessibility

00:11:32.565 --> 00:11:35.988
into the day-to-day development
of every team.

00:11:36.878 --> 00:11:41.233
Then by integrating Accessibility
successfully in the culture

00:11:41.253 --> 00:11:45.012
and making it something
that's thought of more often,

00:11:45.072 --> 00:11:47.944
will show developers
and their business partners

00:11:47.964 --> 00:11:53.131
that eventually Accessibility
will not add to their bandwidth.

00:11:53.151 --> 00:11:54.734
It will not take more time.

00:11:54.756 --> 00:11:58.646
It'll just be something
that's worked in to every feature,

00:11:58.666 --> 00:12:02.479
every story, every bit of work
that the team does.

00:12:07.301 --> 00:12:08.992
The way to get there.

00:12:11.652 --> 00:12:17.267
We're going to talk about
leveling-up accessible culture

00:12:17.412 --> 00:12:18.999
with two main things.

00:12:19.245 --> 00:12:21.169
The first one is adapt.

00:12:21.190 --> 00:12:24.564
Adapt to each team's current process.

00:12:25.147 --> 00:12:29.203
This is where Mark mentioned
that Accessibility teams

00:12:29.303 --> 00:12:33.472
tend to get a little caught up
in trying to force

00:12:33.642 --> 00:12:38.401
on teams a one-size-fits-all suggestion
and process.

00:12:38.533 --> 00:12:41.260
Instead,
we want to challenge people to

00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:42.928
look at what's already there

00:12:42.948 --> 00:12:46.881
and what is already working
and build off of that.

00:12:47.318 --> 00:12:50.752
The next piece is
to use incremental building blocks.

00:12:50.894 --> 00:12:56.924
So pick one small achievable next step
and focus with the team on that

00:12:57.042 --> 00:13:01.021
until the point that
it becomes almost second nature,

00:13:01.242 --> 00:13:03.148
and it is not something

00:13:03.168 --> 00:13:07.337
that the team is barely
even thinking about.

00:13:07.357 --> 00:13:09.515
It's just something that they do,

00:13:09.611 --> 00:13:12.346
instead of giving them
the entire playbook,

00:13:12.366 --> 00:13:15.807
which is overwhelming
and setting them up for failure,

00:13:15.827 --> 00:13:19.532
and they immediately look at it
and start giving excuses.

00:13:19.809 --> 00:13:22.599
That's where we really want
to focus on this

00:13:22.619 --> 00:13:26.181
Meryl Evans quote
of progress over perfection.

00:13:30.605 --> 00:13:37.605
We're going to demonstrate this more fully
by introducing you to a development team.

00:13:39.696 --> 00:13:43.558
Today we are following
the journey of Team Cyclops.

00:13:43.912 --> 00:13:46.803
Team Cyclops is a development team

00:13:46.823 --> 00:13:49.466
that builds a learning website

00:13:49.486 --> 00:13:55.508
with multiple learning topics, videos,
and tracks available to their customers.

00:13:55.836 --> 00:14:02.538
The team is made up of a product manager,
an analyst, three React developers,

00:14:02.558 --> 00:14:04.551
and one tester.

00:14:04.601 --> 00:14:07.364
The team knows what accessibility is

00:14:07.566 --> 00:14:09.544
and they think it's too hard.

00:14:09.699 --> 00:14:11.547
They think that it conflicts

00:14:11.567 --> 00:14:14.679
with their business priorities
and roadmap,

00:14:14.832 --> 00:14:18.522
and they think that it's unachievable
and a moving target.

00:14:20.052 --> 00:14:21.480
<v Mark> How dare them?

00:14:21.759 --> 00:14:23.987
How dare them think that?

00:14:24.007 --> 00:14:25.440
Adding some more pieces to this

00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:28.677
because we have to get into tech specifics
because this would be fun.

00:14:28.697 --> 00:14:31.681
Now, mind you,
this is just an example team.

00:14:31.747 --> 00:14:32.842
This could be anything.

00:14:32.877 --> 00:14:34.631
This could be a WordPress team.

00:14:34.697 --> 00:14:35.958
This could be a content team.

00:14:35.998 --> 00:14:38.517
This could be,
if you want to say it's old-school,

00:14:38.537 --> 00:14:40.109
you can say HTML and JavaScript.

00:14:40.129 --> 00:14:42.034
I know everybody
gets weirded out by that now

00:14:42.054 --> 00:14:44.361
because HTML
and JavaScript is out of style.

00:14:44.952 --> 00:14:47.041
For this team,
specifically for Team Cyclops,

00:14:47.061 --> 00:14:49.453
so tech stack is React.

00:14:49.573 --> 00:14:54.310
They are using a linter that's JSX ESLint.

00:14:54.357 --> 00:14:57.334
If everybody doesn't know,
linter is a static code analyzer

00:14:57.486 --> 00:15:01.311
that analyzes code and checks for issues
as you develop.

00:15:02.050 --> 00:15:06.301
For instance, if you used
an incorrect ARIA role or things like that

00:15:06.563 --> 00:15:07.607
as you're developing,

00:15:07.627 --> 00:15:10.272
it can call those things out
within reason.

00:15:10.990 --> 00:15:13.382
For UI testing,
they have two different levels of tests.

00:15:13.402 --> 00:15:16.599
They're doing component-level testing
with React testing library

00:15:16.750 --> 00:15:19.259
and they're doing UI testing with Cypress,
which is cool.

00:15:19.279 --> 00:15:20.864
So they have integration testing

00:15:21.013 --> 00:15:23.402
and they have UI
or component-level testing

00:15:23.422 --> 00:15:24.863
with React testing library.

00:15:24.967 --> 00:15:28.208
The release process includes code reviews
for each new code change.

00:15:28.228 --> 00:15:30.384
We have a senior developer
that does code reviews

00:15:30.404 --> 00:15:32.461
that hits them to their coding standards

00:15:32.498 --> 00:15:35.032
and they have a definition
of Done for each story.

00:15:35.053 --> 00:15:37.310
That includes a UI testing checklist.

00:15:37.337 --> 00:15:38.577
Your standard look at, "Hey,

00:15:38.597 --> 00:15:40.748
does it look and feel
the same way as design?

00:15:40.777 --> 00:15:42.010
Does it function?

00:15:42.101 --> 00:15:43.990
Does it do the things that we ask, right?"

00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:47.402
99% sure that definition of Done
is everything with a mouse,

00:15:47.423 --> 00:15:49.057
just so everybody knows.

00:15:49.692 --> 00:15:51.103
With that being said,

00:15:52.344 --> 00:15:56.310
let's get into some Mark explaining
some dope infographs

00:15:56.331 --> 00:15:58.614
we're going to end up having [?]

00:15:58.635 --> 00:15:59.667
leveling-up steps.

00:15:59.688 --> 00:16:01.048
Step one.

00:16:01.632 --> 00:16:04.607
Step one to getting us on the right track

00:16:04.633 --> 00:16:06.977
of creating developer culture
accessibility is automation.

00:16:07.037 --> 00:16:08.163
Now,

00:16:08.436 --> 00:16:10.912
everybody needs to know
the person talking right now.

00:16:10.932 --> 00:16:12.392
Hi, I'm Mark.

00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:15.527
I'm the biggest advocate
for accessibility automation

00:16:15.611 --> 00:16:16.611
you will find.

00:16:16.631 --> 00:16:18.487
However, I do know the limitations of it.

00:16:18.507 --> 00:16:19.504
I do know

00:16:19.524 --> 00:16:22.821
that accessibility automation only catches
a lower third of accessibility issues

00:16:22.872 --> 00:16:24.772
and we do know
that it's not going to catch everything.

00:16:24.792 --> 00:16:26.949
However, what is the easiest way

00:16:26.969 --> 00:16:29.292
to start to get a development team

00:16:29.312 --> 00:16:32.899
in line and starting to think
about accessibility?

00:16:32.919 --> 00:16:34.425
It is automation.

00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:35.477
Full stop.

00:16:35.497 --> 00:16:37.590
That is the way to crack
the developer shell

00:16:37.610 --> 00:16:40.352
and get a foot in the door
to start changing that culture,

00:16:40.372 --> 00:16:42.100
is using automation,

00:16:42.186 --> 00:16:43.670
number one.

00:16:44.423 --> 00:16:45.596
As we go through this

00:16:45.616 --> 00:16:47.117
and as we go through
these leveling-up steps,

00:16:47.137 --> 00:16:48.704
we actually have a little graphic
on the side.

00:16:48.737 --> 00:16:51.693
Right now it's a giant staircase,
or I guess

00:16:51.713 --> 00:16:52.528
we call it staircase,

00:16:52.548 --> 00:16:55.161
a bunch of blocks lined up
to look like stairs.

00:16:55.208 --> 00:16:59.059
At the very top, there's an orange block
that says accessibility at every level.

00:16:59.322 --> 00:17:03.335
At the very bottom right now where we are
with a little arrow next to it,

00:17:03.369 --> 00:17:05.747
it says, "A11y is too hard."

00:17:07.182 --> 00:17:09.680
Accessibility is too hard right now.

00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:10.859
That's where our development team is.

00:17:10.879 --> 00:17:12.434
That's where Team Cyclops is right now.

00:17:12.457 --> 00:17:15.278
Is sitting at development is too hard.

00:17:15.309 --> 00:17:17.637
So we're at the very bottom
of the staircase.

00:17:17.697 --> 00:17:19.963
The first step being automation.

00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:22.969
Automation-wise,
Jessie talked about this before.

00:17:23.089 --> 00:17:25.729
For each of these steps,
we're going to have two big things we do.

00:17:25.750 --> 00:17:27.190
We're going to adapt

00:17:27.283 --> 00:17:28.682
and we're going to have
these small building blocks,

00:17:28.702 --> 00:17:30.811
the building blocks of the actions,
the adaptions of the things

00:17:30.831 --> 00:17:32.514
that we look at and we get to.

00:17:32.534 --> 00:17:34.271
Now, the one thing to address

00:17:34.291 --> 00:17:37.641
before we get into this,
is everybody, I can guarantee,

00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:39.833
maybe not everybody,
but at least most of y'all,

00:17:39.908 --> 00:17:43.425
are probably thinking,
"Mark, how does this scale,

00:17:43.452 --> 00:17:46.111
because it's going to be really difficult
to adapt to each thing?"

00:17:46.178 --> 00:17:47.194
It's a great question.

00:17:47.283 --> 00:17:50.446
Honestly, scaling this
isn't as difficult as you think.

00:17:50.469 --> 00:17:51.719
Most development teams

00:17:51.739 --> 00:17:54.590
in large organizations
or even smaller organizations, too,

00:17:54.677 --> 00:17:57.582
tend to probably have similar processes

00:17:57.603 --> 00:17:59.690
or at least groups of them
will have similar processes.

00:17:59.730 --> 00:18:06.633
We only end up with adapting for literally
a few different types of tech stacks

00:18:06.653 --> 00:18:07.941
or testing libraries

00:18:07.961 --> 00:18:11.396
for multiple different groups
of development teams.

00:18:13.941 --> 00:18:16.101
For automation, let's adapt.

00:18:16.317 --> 00:18:17.971
What's there?
Remember we mentioned before,

00:18:17.991 --> 00:18:20.228
UI testing, we have React testing library,

00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:21.666
and we have Cypress.

00:18:21.884 --> 00:18:24.062
We talk to this team
and they say, "Hey, well,

00:18:24.129 --> 00:18:28.092
most of our testing is actually done
at the integration level with Cypress."

00:18:28.150 --> 00:18:30.244
We say, "Hey, awesome, that's great."

00:18:30.317 --> 00:18:32.340
We know that.
Hey, you do most of your testing,

00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:34.538
most of your results come back
from UI testing with Cypress.

00:18:34.561 --> 00:18:35.443
Awesome.

00:18:35.463 --> 00:18:36.768
We need to know that. We got it.

00:18:36.820 --> 00:18:37.873
Thumbs up.

00:18:38.085 --> 00:18:40.458
For linters, they have JSX ESLint.

00:18:40.605 --> 00:18:42.211
We knew that, right?

00:18:42.492 --> 00:18:43.835
Adapting to what's there,

00:18:43.866 --> 00:18:46.306
how can we take
building blocks off of that?

00:18:47.203 --> 00:18:48.323
The first step,

00:18:49.419 --> 00:18:53.769
we're going to use Axe-Cypress
within their Cypress regression test.

00:18:53.923 --> 00:18:57.447
What that does is now
for the regression test,

00:18:57.467 --> 00:19:04.029
we have an automated accessibility test
in their UI testing regression suite.

00:19:04.283 --> 00:19:06.794
Now every time it runs,
every time they have a pull request,

00:19:06.879 --> 00:19:09.771
we are now getting accessibility results
back to them.

00:19:09.791 --> 00:19:12.790
It just becomes a part of that UI testing

00:19:12.810 --> 00:19:16.120
that they have over
and over and over, right?

00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:17.742
Again, we're not changing anything.

00:19:17.858 --> 00:19:19.403
We're not making a huge wholesale change.

00:19:19.423 --> 00:19:20.615
We're just adapting to what's there

00:19:20.636 --> 00:19:21.913
and just doing a small
building block to say,

00:19:21.933 --> 00:19:24.283
"Hey, start adding accessibility tests
in here."

00:19:24.881 --> 00:19:25.881
That's number one.

00:19:25.901 --> 00:19:28.394
Number two,
the linter that we talked about.

00:19:28.542 --> 00:19:30.466
JSX ESLint.

00:19:31.122 --> 00:19:32.122
Guess what?

00:19:32.142 --> 00:19:33.321
It has accessibility rules.

00:19:33.341 --> 00:19:34.278
I can tell you right now.

00:19:34.298 --> 00:19:36.498
I know we're using React as an example.

00:19:36.757 --> 00:19:38.583
I can tell you right now,
for linting tools,

00:19:38.603 --> 00:19:41.464
almost every single one of them,
especially the ESLints,

00:19:41.501 --> 00:19:43.483
have accessibility rules baked into them.

00:19:43.536 --> 00:19:45.053
Simply turn them on.

00:19:45.129 --> 00:19:48.980
Talk to your development teams,
turn them on and get them using it ASAP.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:52.532
Even if it is one single rule,

00:19:52.568 --> 00:19:53.818
who cares?

00:19:53.838 --> 00:19:57.028
One rule is better than none.

00:19:57.072 --> 00:19:58.079
I always give an example.

00:19:58.099 --> 00:20:04.317
There's an application out in the wild
that had 50 different individual issues

00:20:04.337 --> 00:20:05.814
that were missing images.

00:20:05.859 --> 00:20:07.811
If they would turn on a linter,
they would have fixed that

00:20:07.832 --> 00:20:09.390
in the one component and 50 issues

00:20:09.410 --> 00:20:12.706
would have been fixed
for one instance of using a linter.

00:20:13.821 --> 00:20:16.171
Adapting to those blocks and using it,

00:20:16.334 --> 00:20:19.381
now what we have is
we have two different levels.

00:20:19.401 --> 00:20:21.761
We have linting and we have UI testing.

00:20:23.115 --> 00:20:24.835
We're giving them the building blocks
to run with it.

00:20:24.848 --> 00:20:26.692
Now if we look at it and we say, "Hey,

00:20:26.712 --> 00:20:29.064
Team Cyclops, where are you at?"

00:20:29.472 --> 00:20:32.296
Well, let's say
a couple months have gone by.

00:20:32.325 --> 00:20:33.797
Three months, four months.

00:20:33.882 --> 00:20:35.844
By the way,
this takes as long as it takes.

00:20:35.864 --> 00:20:37.401
Jessie and I aren't going to sit here
and tell you all,

00:20:37.422 --> 00:20:38.544
this takes two weeks.

00:20:38.564 --> 00:20:39.428
Good luck. Have fun.

00:20:39.448 --> 00:20:40.389
No.

00:20:40.642 --> 00:20:43.271
Updating, getting developer culture

00:20:43.424 --> 00:20:45.929
to evolve to include accessibility
takes time.

00:20:45.979 --> 00:20:47.519
It is what it is, right?

00:20:47.627 --> 00:20:49.043
What that time is,

00:20:49.154 --> 00:20:50.378
you can never tell.

00:20:50.398 --> 00:20:51.901
You can never dictate that time frame.

00:20:51.921 --> 00:20:54.052
You just have to kind of roll with it
and say,

00:20:54.073 --> 00:20:56.012
we know that we need to do these things.

00:20:56.032 --> 00:20:57.270
They take as long as they take.

00:20:57.672 --> 00:21:00.361
During this, just know we're not
putting time frames on this whatsoever,

00:21:00.381 --> 00:21:01.327
but it takes as long as it takes.

00:21:01.379 --> 00:21:03.378
Let's say a few months go by.

00:21:04.902 --> 00:21:07.335
Team Cyclops have turned on accessibility

00:21:07.356 --> 00:21:09.964
and went through rules
and added Axe-Cypress

00:21:09.984 --> 00:21:13.449
within their Cypress regression test,
and now they're checking automated issues.

00:21:13.469 --> 00:21:15.219
They're getting results back.

00:21:16.149 --> 00:21:17.166
That's great.

00:21:17.187 --> 00:21:18.741
That's the first step.

00:21:20.416 --> 00:21:23.274
The team now values accessibility,

00:21:23.473 --> 00:21:25.111
but they think

00:21:25.339 --> 00:21:26.800
that they are done.

00:21:26.839 --> 00:21:30.636
They've implemented automation
and they've achieved peak accessibility.

00:21:30.656 --> 00:21:32.439
I laugh at that every time
because I've heard

00:21:32.459 --> 00:21:33.871
that so many times in my career.

00:21:33.916 --> 00:21:36.606
They think they've achieved
peak accessibility.

00:21:36.626 --> 00:21:38.230
They're done.

00:21:38.419 --> 00:21:41.433
I'm sure everybody on this call
has heard that same thing.

00:21:41.804 --> 00:21:42.966
Everybody knows that's a fallacy.

00:21:42.986 --> 00:21:44.859
Everybody knows that's wrong, right?

00:21:44.987 --> 00:21:46.327
That's okay.

00:21:46.425 --> 00:21:49.565
The main thing is that
we have them using automation.

00:21:49.592 --> 00:21:51.093
It's in their specific pieces.

00:21:51.113 --> 00:21:52.696
It's they're ready to go

00:21:52.753 --> 00:21:56.766
because this is where we tend
to make the mistake.

00:21:56.836 --> 00:22:01.626
We tend to want to do automation
and then some type of enforcement

00:22:01.646 --> 00:22:04.533
or you've got fixing
this release beforehand

00:22:04.554 --> 00:22:06.501
and teams can't figure it out.

00:22:06.522 --> 00:22:08.734
They don't even get to the point
where they set up

00:22:08.755 --> 00:22:10.088
their UI tests for their linters

00:22:10.108 --> 00:22:13.654
because they get caught
in kind of a brain freeze

00:22:13.674 --> 00:22:15.722
where they can't figure out
how they're going to do this.

00:22:15.743 --> 00:22:19.409
Start with automation
without enforcement because guess what?

00:22:19.872 --> 00:22:21.470
Now we go into code reviews.

00:22:21.856 --> 00:22:25.317
If we're looking at the level-up piece,
that's along the way.

00:22:25.845 --> 00:22:27.159
We went from "A11y is too hard."

00:22:27.179 --> 00:22:29.506
now we went up two steps,

00:22:29.715 --> 00:22:32.161
and now the arrow is pointing on the step
that says, "We use automation."

00:22:32.181 --> 00:22:34.741
That's where Team Cyclops is right now.

00:22:34.871 --> 00:22:37.323
We need to go up a couple more steps.

00:22:37.814 --> 00:22:40.382
We need to start enforcing it.

00:22:41.143 --> 00:22:44.241
Keyword from what I said before,
when you're using automation,

00:22:44.262 --> 00:22:46.531
we're not trying to run enforcement
while we're setting automation up.

00:22:46.551 --> 00:22:48.246
We're just trying to get them set up.

00:22:48.312 --> 00:22:52.702
Now we use code reviews
to start enforcing

00:22:52.722 --> 00:22:54.066
some of those automation pieces,

00:22:54.086 --> 00:22:56.547
but also a couple other things
because code reviews,

00:22:56.568 --> 00:22:59.167
everybody tends to think that code reviews
don't really exist in the world anymore.

00:22:59.187 --> 00:23:00.403
They sure do.

00:23:03.196 --> 00:23:05.349
They are just as strict as they were

00:23:05.370 --> 00:23:07.877
when we started doing code reviews
back in the day.

00:23:07.905 --> 00:23:09.528
They're strict. They are.

00:23:10.542 --> 00:23:14.470
We need to know and find a way
to get in there and adapt to what's there.

00:23:14.757 --> 00:23:18.797
Talking about what's there,
our code reviews for each new code change.

00:23:18.914 --> 00:23:20.874
For those who are familiar
with GitHub and all the process,

00:23:20.894 --> 00:23:21.847
it's a PR.

00:23:21.977 --> 00:23:22.738
For those not,

00:23:22.758 --> 00:23:25.526
any new code change
that gets checked in,

00:23:25.547 --> 00:23:26.736
they're looking for code quality.

00:23:26.756 --> 00:23:31.589
That could be specifically any type
of code quality standards we have

00:23:31.609 --> 00:23:34.951
just looking from
a just a plain coding standpoint,

00:23:35.025 --> 00:23:37.473
and they're looking for valid HTML.

00:23:37.518 --> 00:23:38.757
By valid HTML,

00:23:38.779 --> 00:23:40.629
just make sure
everybody's listening on there.

00:23:40.691 --> 00:23:42.906
Valid HTML does not mean semantic HTML.

00:23:42.926 --> 00:23:44.389
It just means that it's valid.

00:23:44.446 --> 00:23:45.449
That's it.

00:23:45.469 --> 00:23:48.033
Valid HTML can be horrendous.

00:23:48.118 --> 00:23:49.930
Everybody should know that.

00:23:50.117 --> 00:23:52.753
What can we do to adapt to
what's there

00:23:52.773 --> 00:23:54.271
and build off of it?

00:23:54.291 --> 00:23:56.166
Our building blocks now.

00:23:56.444 --> 00:23:58.119
Automation enforcement.

00:23:58.152 --> 00:24:02.522
Code cannot be merged
with linting and UI automation failures.

00:24:02.542 --> 00:24:03.774
That's number one.

00:24:04.034 --> 00:24:05.585
Now, you can use
a multitude of different things.

00:24:05.605 --> 00:24:08.965
You can use human intervention
or you can use GitHub actions to do that,

00:24:09.048 --> 00:24:12.106
but automation cannot be merged at all.

00:24:12.972 --> 00:24:15.518
Now we're starting to hit that,
"Hey, we did this step one.

00:24:15.538 --> 00:24:19.431
Now you cannot do anything without--

00:24:19.771 --> 00:24:23.404
you cannot merge code
without fixing your automated issues."

00:24:23.846 --> 00:24:25.714
That's not the only thing,
because we did say

00:24:25.734 --> 00:24:28.074
they do code quality and valid HTML.

00:24:29.561 --> 00:24:32.384
Let's look at semantic HTML usage.

00:24:32.809 --> 00:24:34.787
The amount of issues that you can fix

00:24:34.807 --> 00:24:37.638
by someone simply going into
a code review and saying,

00:24:37.782 --> 00:24:39.922
"Hi, that ARIA is garbage.

00:24:39.949 --> 00:24:41.787
Use semantic HTML."

00:24:44.593 --> 00:24:46.796
It's endless.
I'm just telling you all right now.

00:24:46.994 --> 00:24:52.552
Semantic HTML uses and checking for it
is a huge added value in a code review.

00:24:52.609 --> 00:24:58.087
Ensuring that ARIA isn't overused,
or if you're using incorrect HTML,

00:24:58.107 --> 00:25:00.768
and we should use semantics
that are better for it.

00:25:00.792 --> 00:25:01.863
We can't.

00:25:02.233 --> 00:25:04.849
Just doing those two things
in code reviews,

00:25:05.027 --> 00:25:06.960
now brings that enforcement in

00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:10.083
and now begins to get
the team to think, "Okay,

00:25:11.266 --> 00:25:12.633
we're going to do this
accessibility thing.

00:25:12.895 --> 00:25:14.635
I need to do this."

00:25:15.764 --> 00:25:18.324
If we look at where Team Cyclops is now,

00:25:18.827 --> 00:25:20.987
they're checking for semantic HTML

00:25:21.048 --> 00:25:24.097
and they're enforcing automation pieces
from step one.

00:25:24.342 --> 00:25:29.270
We've kind of had those building blocks
on top of building blocks.

00:25:29.484 --> 00:25:31.265
We've kind of had those
building blocks in place.

00:25:31.353 --> 00:25:34.056
Now we've went from checking semantic HTML

00:25:34.076 --> 00:25:37.387
to enforcing automation pieces
from step one.

00:25:38.086 --> 00:25:40.388
Now we're starting
to get a little bit more of,

00:25:40.408 --> 00:25:41.839
"Hey, this is required.

00:25:41.865 --> 00:25:43.024
We need to do this."

00:25:43.766 --> 00:25:46.282
It's not just somebody coming down

00:25:46.339 --> 00:25:49.161
from executive leadership
or on the accessibility team saying,

00:25:49.182 --> 00:25:50.252
"You guys got to do this."

00:25:50.272 --> 00:25:52.567
No, you're starting to see
some of the people say,

00:25:52.587 --> 00:25:55.040
"Okay, hey, now this makes sense."

00:25:55.107 --> 00:25:56.341
This can fit in.

00:25:56.451 --> 00:25:57.451
This is easy.

00:25:58.181 --> 00:26:01.876
Now it starts to build itself internally.

00:26:01.932 --> 00:26:03.395
Not just from the accessibility team.

00:26:03.415 --> 00:26:05.672
It's starting to build itself up
internally of,

00:26:05.692 --> 00:26:07.263
"Hey, we can do these things.

00:26:07.283 --> 00:26:08.815
It's not too difficult."

00:26:09.176 --> 00:26:11.306
The team practices
accessibility regularly.

00:26:11.506 --> 00:26:15.601
However, they think that they enforce
all necessary accessibility practices

00:26:15.621 --> 00:26:17.454
now through automation and semantics.

00:26:17.475 --> 00:26:18.955
Notice a common theme here.

00:26:19.462 --> 00:26:22.438
Development teams tend to think,
"Oh, we did it. We're done."

00:26:22.458 --> 00:26:25.048
over and over again
during this entire example.

00:26:25.148 --> 00:26:27.842
It's the case. They tend to think that
they're done with a lot of things.

00:26:27.895 --> 00:26:29.460
The thing is, the key is,

00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:31.473
is just to keep evolving them
and keep pushing them,

00:26:31.513 --> 00:26:33.655
which we'll get to more of.

00:26:33.971 --> 00:26:34.987
We're here.

00:26:35.028 --> 00:26:36.579
We're in step two.

00:26:36.793 --> 00:26:39.683
We're starting to enforce it
through code reviews.

00:26:40.161 --> 00:26:41.466
Where can we go next?

00:26:41.486 --> 00:26:44.930
This is where we get stuck a little bit.

00:26:45.137 --> 00:26:46.204
Where do we go next?

00:26:46.224 --> 00:26:47.234
Well,

00:26:48.107 --> 00:26:51.615
Jessie's going to tell us where we go next
because I don't even know.

00:26:55.456 --> 00:26:57.274
Jessie: All right.

00:26:57.798 --> 00:27:03.006
Now we are further up our staircase.

00:27:03.026 --> 00:27:06.948
We're about halfway
and two steps from our ideal,

00:27:07.065 --> 00:27:10.046
which is accessibility at every level.

00:27:10.902 --> 00:27:14.778
We have implemented automation.

00:27:14.804 --> 00:27:17.432
We've improved code reviews
and added enforcement.

00:27:18.265 --> 00:27:24.077
Next, we are going to talk about improving
on the team's definition of done.

00:27:26.290 --> 00:27:28.630
First of all, a definition of done

00:27:28.650 --> 00:27:34.273
is an agreed-upon set of items
that a team must complete

00:27:34.293 --> 00:27:36.984
before they consider a piece of work done.

00:27:37.288 --> 00:27:40.182
We mentioned
in our introduction of the team

00:27:40.202 --> 00:27:43.377
that they have a UI testing checklist.

00:27:43.438 --> 00:27:46.933
Mark mentioned that
it is all mouse-oriented.

00:27:49.017 --> 00:27:51.247
For our building blocks,

00:27:51.267 --> 00:27:54.620
we're going to now add
some accessibility manual checks

00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:56.432
to the definition of done

00:27:56.604 --> 00:28:00.559
that is completed with every set of work.

00:28:00.622 --> 00:28:05.938
The most important thing here is that
we are not adding all manual checks.

00:28:06.116 --> 00:28:09.750
I mentioned earlier that
a really easy mistake to make

00:28:09.770 --> 00:28:12.473
is to give people the entire playbook,

00:28:12.658 --> 00:28:15.760
but development teams
can't do all of that

00:28:15.780 --> 00:28:19.762
and keep their velocity
or their timeline the same.

00:28:20.096 --> 00:28:23.767
Again, if you try to give them too much,
they'll get overwhelmed,

00:28:23.846 --> 00:28:27.403
they'll make mistakes,
and they'll make excuses.

00:28:28.955 --> 00:28:33.469
You might think the best thing
is to give them 20 tests,

00:28:33.490 --> 00:28:35.935
then they can pick and choose

00:28:35.956 --> 00:28:39.154
which ones to apply
based on the situation.

00:28:39.563 --> 00:28:42.339
They don't really have
the knowledge base to do that.

00:28:42.655 --> 00:28:44.150
Instead,

00:28:44.482 --> 00:28:46.515
keep it as simple as you can.

00:28:46.535 --> 00:28:51.715
We can add in just keyboard testing
or just visual testing,

00:28:51.776 --> 00:28:55.630
but not screen reader
testing as our first step.

00:28:56.109 --> 00:28:59.990
The goal is always going to be
to add in more steps,

00:29:00.217 --> 00:29:03.214
but we just want to start
with a really small piece

00:29:03.234 --> 00:29:05.512
until the team gets to the point

00:29:05.664 --> 00:29:09.072
where they are doing this
with every story,

00:29:09.092 --> 00:29:12.159
where they don't even have
to like look at their list,

00:29:12.179 --> 00:29:17.396
they just know what to look at,
and then you continue to build from there.

00:29:22.374 --> 00:29:27.404
So our final update
with Team Cyclops is that

00:29:27.851 --> 00:29:29.831
we now enforce automation,

00:29:29.851 --> 00:29:35.248
and we run basic manual tests
of the product at a regular cadence.

00:29:35.452 --> 00:29:38.711
We're catching a lot more than we used to.

00:29:38.788 --> 00:29:43.332
It's a really, really
important practice to the team.

00:29:43.379 --> 00:29:47.247
We're teaching new team members
about all these things.

00:29:47.818 --> 00:29:52.466
The development culture
is keeping accessibility at the forefront,

00:29:52.528 --> 00:29:56.771
but the team thinks
that accessibility is only

00:29:56.791 --> 00:29:59.446
a developer's responsibility.

00:30:03.802 --> 00:30:09.992
Now we are one step away from our ideal,
which is accessibility at every level,

00:30:10.012 --> 00:30:14.370
and we are sitting at
"Accessible content is what we do."

00:30:14.783 --> 00:30:16.754
Now what? Where do we go from here?

00:30:16.774 --> 00:30:19.326
We all know that we're not done.

00:30:20.421 --> 00:30:24.149
We illustrated this
by calling our next step,

00:30:24.235 --> 00:30:28.580
step four, through infinity,
and this is really the long haul.

00:30:28.889 --> 00:30:33.990
Mark mentioned we have no idea
how long each step is going to take.

00:30:34.043 --> 00:30:35.778
It's going to vary team to team.

00:30:35.798 --> 00:30:37.532
We also have no idea

00:30:37.586 --> 00:30:40.781
how many steps
we're going to have to go through,

00:30:40.893 --> 00:30:44.810
but we can keep using
this same framework

00:30:45.683 --> 00:30:47.480
with whatever we choose to do next.

00:30:47.641 --> 00:30:53.639
Some examples is providing more education,
focusing on other roles,

00:30:53.692 --> 00:30:56.270
and the list could go on and on and on,

00:30:56.350 --> 00:30:58.085
but no matter what's next,

00:30:58.132 --> 00:31:02.870
we want to stick to the framework of
looking at what is there

00:31:02.890 --> 00:31:06.988
and adapting and picking one
small building block.

00:31:08.106 --> 00:31:09.106
<v Mark> Yes.

00:31:09.279 --> 00:31:11.070
Right on, because

00:31:12.197 --> 00:31:16.289
we're going to repeat everything
for eternity as a group.

00:31:17.303 --> 00:31:21.870
The one thing to know with
what Jessie said as well, kind of just to

00:31:21.890 --> 00:31:23.520
play off of it is

00:31:23.540 --> 00:31:29.463
all the steps for step four
might be step four to 4,000.

00:31:29.497 --> 00:31:30.464
It just depends on

00:31:30.484 --> 00:31:33.262
what it comes to as far as setting
these things up and going with it,

00:31:33.282 --> 00:31:38.065
because ultimately picking your next thing

00:31:38.157 --> 00:31:41.430
is a big process.

00:31:42.263 --> 00:31:44.471
For a developer culture,
you can get to a certain extent,

00:31:44.491 --> 00:31:48.708
but eventually, it bleeds
into other roles, right?

00:31:48.728 --> 00:31:51.986
We need other people to come along with us
around development team.

00:31:52.040 --> 00:31:54.873
That's one thing that Jessie
and I, as we were building this out,

00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:57.942
we started to talk through,
was when we talk to development teams,

00:31:57.963 --> 00:32:00.797
everybody tends to think
it's literally just the developers

00:32:00.857 --> 00:32:05.070
who sit there and do all the code work,
do all the stuff.

00:32:05.090 --> 00:32:07.710
In reality, a development team

00:32:08.190 --> 00:32:10.428
can stretch outside of us really quickly,

00:32:10.449 --> 00:32:11.722
outside of that development team.

00:32:11.756 --> 00:32:14.482
Product owners, scrum masters, designers.

00:32:14.522 --> 00:32:18.376
All of that phases
into a development team.

00:32:18.597 --> 00:32:20.952
When you pick your next thing,
you just have to adapt to what's there.

00:32:20.972 --> 00:32:22.476
Assess what is there.

00:32:22.623 --> 00:32:24.453
Do my developers,
scrum masters, quality engineers

00:32:24.473 --> 00:32:26.383
need education like Jessie said?

00:32:26.470 --> 00:32:30.168
Does my quality testing
fit into the development life cycle?

00:32:31.437 --> 00:32:33.462
Some of those big checklists
that Jessie has mentioned,

00:32:33.482 --> 00:32:35.795
where you just do
simple things for developers,

00:32:35.871 --> 00:32:37.522
maybe those checklists get larger

00:32:37.585 --> 00:32:40.427
for QA folks
or quality testers to do more,

00:32:40.494 --> 00:32:42.283
to catch more issues.

00:32:42.665 --> 00:32:45.465
Then once you adapt and see what's there,

00:32:45.568 --> 00:32:47.993
take the building blocks
and build off of that

00:32:48.013 --> 00:32:54.996
because there's an opportunity to grow
Accessibility now to great heights,

00:32:55.524 --> 00:32:57.376
great heights within this.

00:32:57.396 --> 00:33:00.704
Because the one thing
that people tend to do specifically

00:33:00.724 --> 00:33:04.278
when it comes to trying
to change a culture,

00:33:04.523 --> 00:33:06.758
is they stop.

00:33:07.253 --> 00:33:09.409
I'm going to hark back
to the very beginning

00:33:09.429 --> 00:33:13.671
of this entire presentation
where Jessie gave the overview of culture.

00:33:13.882 --> 00:33:17.153
That is the biggest thing
that people forget.

00:33:17.246 --> 00:33:18.980
Culture is not stagnant.

00:33:19.223 --> 00:33:21.123
It is always evolving.

00:33:21.174 --> 00:33:22.216
It is always changing.

00:33:22.236 --> 00:33:24.034
Whether it's subtle or not,

00:33:24.263 --> 00:33:25.477
it is always changing.

00:33:25.768 --> 00:33:28.031
Taking the time to know what's there

00:33:28.091 --> 00:33:31.356
and adjusting
is the biggest thing for us.

00:33:31.376 --> 00:33:33.747
It's ensuring that
we just keep moving that culture

00:33:33.767 --> 00:33:36.654
and moving that needle to a point
where accessibility is involved

00:33:36.713 --> 00:33:40.698
over and over and always staying
on a consistent spot.

00:33:40.917 --> 00:33:42.563
Someone brought this up
to me before and said,

00:33:42.622 --> 00:33:44.113
"Is it keeping developers on their toes?"

00:33:44.133 --> 00:33:45.467
No, that's not what it is.

00:33:45.487 --> 00:33:46.870
It's just looking for those gaps

00:33:46.890 --> 00:33:50.270
and finding the next thing
and adapting to it as we go.

00:33:51.538 --> 00:33:53.016
Bringing this all home.

00:33:53.830 --> 00:33:57.318
I always end talks and everyone says that
when I end talks,

00:33:57.338 --> 00:33:59.278
I have this gigantic spiel.

00:33:59.343 --> 00:34:01.985
I'm sorry,
I'm going to still have a gigantic spiel.

00:34:02.358 --> 00:34:03.515
Everyone will be fine.

00:34:03.684 --> 00:34:05.186
Bring it all home.

00:34:05.544 --> 00:34:08.806
Development team culture is something
that is constantly evolving and changing,

00:34:08.826 --> 00:34:09.853
even though it may not seem like.

00:34:09.873 --> 00:34:12.152
I'm repeating that a thousand times over,

00:34:12.174 --> 00:34:13.410
but it is true.

00:34:13.523 --> 00:34:15.633
It very much is true.

00:34:15.893 --> 00:34:19.847
One of the hardest things to crack

00:34:19.867 --> 00:34:21.494
is the outer shell
of the development team.

00:34:21.514 --> 00:34:25.577
I'm sure everybody on here
has been with a development team

00:34:25.597 --> 00:34:31.965
and has had the not-so-nice pleasure
of trying to crack that outer shell

00:34:31.985 --> 00:34:35.077
to get to them to talk about
accessibility, all that, right?

00:34:35.142 --> 00:34:38.530
Well, taking the time to adapt
to see what's there,

00:34:38.608 --> 00:34:41.887
taking small building blocks
can help take that

00:34:41.907 --> 00:34:44.354
ease off of trying to crack
that outer shell.

00:34:45.351 --> 00:34:47.073
Because if I come to you--

00:34:47.093 --> 00:34:49.054
Hey, I was that dev.

00:34:49.191 --> 00:34:50.717
Hell, Jessie was that dev.

00:34:50.905 --> 00:34:55.559
You came to me saying, "Knock, knock,
accessibility, let go, right?"

00:34:55.618 --> 00:34:58.454
You're going to be like,
"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Like,

00:34:58.474 --> 00:35:00.257
what are you giving me this for."

00:35:00.542 --> 00:35:02.443
Taking the time
to figure out your environment,

00:35:02.463 --> 00:35:05.205
figure out what
your development team culture already is

00:35:05.225 --> 00:35:06.475
and where it's at,

00:35:06.495 --> 00:35:08.731
what they do,
all the process involved, right?

00:35:08.752 --> 00:35:13.429
We used a quick example here,
but taking that time to learn it,

00:35:13.450 --> 00:35:16.065
can help you take that
culture to those norms

00:35:16.085 --> 00:35:18.078
that we talked about,
those defined processes,

00:35:18.098 --> 00:35:22.690
those goals that sits in there
and lives for a long time.

00:35:23.943 --> 00:35:25.502
At the very end of the day,

00:35:25.762 --> 00:35:30.093
we want to shift the culture of A11y
from it is hard

00:35:30.770 --> 00:35:33.650
to we just give a damn
about accessibility.

00:35:33.670 --> 00:35:36.569
That is what you want
at the end of the freaking day

00:35:36.717 --> 00:35:40.936
because too many developers
right now don't care.

00:35:41.330 --> 00:35:44.145
It's not that they don't care,
it's just they don't know.

00:35:45.869 --> 00:35:49.730
They don't want to do this stuff because
it makes life a little bit more difficult

00:35:49.797 --> 00:35:51.013
and processes come along.

00:35:51.037 --> 00:35:53.039
That's not a product
of the accessibility groups.

00:35:53.059 --> 00:35:54.492
It's just a product
of business priorities,

00:35:54.512 --> 00:35:55.508
things like that that come in.

00:35:55.529 --> 00:35:59.209
We as Accessibility advocates
and those who work with development teams,

00:35:59.272 --> 00:36:04.232
we can easily adjust them to get them to
start to give a damn about accessibility

00:36:04.286 --> 00:36:08.908
when we adapt and use building blocks
and shift that culture around.

00:36:09.262 --> 00:36:11.271
With that being said,

00:36:12.414 --> 00:36:13.514
thanks.

00:36:13.535 --> 00:36:14.722
I'm just kidding.

00:36:14.774 --> 00:36:18.242
Are there any questions from anybody?

00:36:18.297 --> 00:36:20.349
Oh, geez. Again, too early.

00:36:20.514 --> 00:36:22.050
Too early in the morning.

00:36:25.226 --> 00:36:27.485
<v Piccia> Hey, Jessie. Hey, Mark.

00:36:27.505 --> 00:36:28.545
Thank you so much.

00:36:28.565 --> 00:36:32.909
This was incredibly interesting
on many, many levels,

00:36:32.932 --> 00:36:36.226
whether you are a developer or not,
and I'm not.

00:36:36.522 --> 00:36:40.383
I found it so interesting
because I work with organizations

00:36:40.430 --> 00:36:43.143
helping them shift their culture
to accessibility.

00:36:43.214 --> 00:36:45.979
These insights were amazing.

00:36:46.197 --> 00:36:49.273
We have quite a few really good questions,

00:36:49.293 --> 00:36:52.496
which is a shame because then
mine gets pushed to the bottom.

00:36:52.517 --> 00:36:53.523
Here we are.

00:36:54.809 --> 00:36:56.353
<v Mark> We'll answer them quick
so we can get to yours.

00:36:56.373 --> 00:36:57.596
We're good. No, I'm just kidding.

00:36:57.655 --> 00:36:58.516
<v Piccia> Yes, exactly.

00:36:58.536 --> 00:37:01.482
There's various other ways
of interacting with you later,

00:37:01.502 --> 00:37:04.122
so we'll all get our answers, I'm sure.

00:37:04.580 --> 00:37:07.847
The first one is from David Donado.

00:37:08.018 --> 00:37:13.620
How can plugin developers
handle legacy non-accessible code

00:37:13.674 --> 00:37:17.956
that's already widely used
while ensuring backwards compatibility?

00:37:17.976 --> 00:37:21.171
This is going to be so interesting
for so many of us.

00:37:21.898 --> 00:37:23.435
<v Mark> All right.

00:37:23.871 --> 00:37:29.578
Number one, that is a loaded question,
so I'm going to break it down in two ways.

00:37:29.685 --> 00:37:33.518
Number one, how you can handle
legacy non-accessible code.

00:37:34.405 --> 00:37:37.402
So, especially for plugin developers,
I get it.

00:37:37.971 --> 00:37:39.768
There is a ton of legacy code out there.

00:37:39.792 --> 00:37:42.713
It is very difficult to be able to handle
and or switch teams

00:37:42.733 --> 00:37:45.380
to be able to fix those issues as well.

00:37:48.905 --> 00:37:50.801
I'll have Jessie,
if Jessie has any thoughts on this too,

00:37:50.821 --> 00:37:52.894
but I will make a controversial statement.

00:37:52.935 --> 00:37:55.195
If anybody's listening
who has heard me say this before,

00:37:55.215 --> 00:37:58.187
will probably find me after this talk,
and be like,

00:37:58.207 --> 00:37:59.207
"Quit saying that."

00:37:59.227 --> 00:38:02.910
Number one, there is ways
to deal with legacy code

00:38:02.930 --> 00:38:04.993
if it's code that is untouchable.

00:38:05.013 --> 00:38:07.167
Meaning like,
"Hey, it's not worth our time

00:38:07.187 --> 00:38:10.005
or anybody else's time
to touch it or go through it."

00:38:10.923 --> 00:38:14.987
You can just actually add in
a simple JavaScript file

00:38:15.007 --> 00:38:16.195
to fix some of the issues.

00:38:16.215 --> 00:38:19.224
Yes, I know everyone's going to say
that's not scaling the source.

00:38:19.244 --> 00:38:22.524
However, if you can't touch that source
and they won't let you,

00:38:22.570 --> 00:38:26.024
you can actually use JavaScript to
go back here and fix a bulk of the issues

00:38:26.045 --> 00:38:28.613
and just have that file there and live
so you don't have to go back

00:38:28.633 --> 00:38:31.291
and retrofit
the old components themselves.

00:38:31.417 --> 00:38:32.498
That is one way.

00:38:32.525 --> 00:38:35.694
That is ways I've seen people do it before
because they can't touch that code,

00:38:35.714 --> 00:38:38.012
like can't touch the actual markup code

00:38:38.076 --> 00:38:41.083
and they have to find a way
to get in there and do that.

00:38:41.410 --> 00:38:44.232
Everybody knows that is not an overlay.

00:38:44.252 --> 00:38:49.826
It is specific for that fix
and specific for that HTML to fix,

00:38:49.846 --> 00:38:51.133
so there's that.

00:38:51.302 --> 00:38:53.986
It does deal
with backwards compatibilities.

00:38:54.006 --> 00:38:55.342
However,

00:38:55.382 --> 00:38:58.043
when it comes to some legacy code
from accessibility side of things

00:38:58.064 --> 00:38:59.769
as backwards compatibility,

00:38:59.857 --> 00:39:01.812
it gets real tough real quick.

00:39:02.672 --> 00:39:05.989
JavaScript fixing-wise
does cover that a little bit,

00:39:06.009 --> 00:39:08.577
but not really.

00:39:10.688 --> 00:39:13.799
Ensuring backwards compatibility
can get really tough.

00:39:13.977 --> 00:39:16.197
I'm going to be honest,
I'm going to struggle for an answer

00:39:16.217 --> 00:39:17.931
on backwards compatibility pieces.

00:39:17.952 --> 00:39:20.789
As far as legacy non-accessible code,

00:39:20.809 --> 00:39:23.081
like for plugins,
that's one way to do it.

00:39:24.170 --> 00:39:27.276
I mean, that's really the way that
I would say to do it and to deal with it,

00:39:27.304 --> 00:39:29.577
unless Jessie,
you had other thoughts on that.

00:39:33.128 --> 00:39:34.465
I hope that answers the question, David.

00:39:34.485 --> 00:39:36.718
I know I'm kind of roundabouting
with it a little bit,

00:39:36.738 --> 00:39:41.485
but that is a tough question,
especially at 5:40 in the morning.

00:39:41.505 --> 00:39:42.714
I'm just kidding.

00:39:44.077 --> 00:39:48.310
I'm happy to talk more on it
too outside of this as well on

00:39:48.390 --> 00:39:49.801
what we can do.

00:39:52.377 --> 00:39:55.150
<v Piccia> Jessie, any thoughts
on this very hard question

00:39:55.170 --> 00:39:57.342
at any time of the day or night,

00:39:57.366 --> 00:39:58.623
I may add?

00:40:00.544 --> 00:40:01.956
Jessie: Yes, I mean,

00:40:02.287 --> 00:40:04.945
it's hard.
I think just keeping in mind too

00:40:04.965 --> 00:40:09.390
that any small improvement is helpful

00:40:09.410 --> 00:40:14.657
and we're not aiming for perfection,
especially with legacy code.

00:40:14.824 --> 00:40:19.551
I mean, never,
but especially when there's difficulties,

00:40:19.571 --> 00:40:21.797
like any little bit helps.

00:40:22.057 --> 00:40:23.997
<v Piccia> Yes, very good point.

00:40:24.668 --> 00:40:26.571
Documenting what you do as well

00:40:26.591 --> 00:40:29.457
helps a lot
even with possible legal issues.

00:40:29.477 --> 00:40:31.605
That's the main thing.

00:40:31.626 --> 00:40:34.228
And then we have another,
because we have quite a few questions,

00:40:34.248 --> 00:40:37.143
and the next one is by Anna Greve,

00:40:37.176 --> 00:40:38.213
who says,

00:40:38.253 --> 00:40:41.984
"I'm working with a relatively small
and new dev team,

00:40:42.006 --> 00:40:43.935
so we don't have much in place

00:40:43.955 --> 00:40:48.085
with things like automation tools
and code review.

00:40:48.512 --> 00:40:50.651
Where do you suggest we start?"

00:40:50.821 --> 00:40:52.038
Another good one.

00:40:52.258 --> 00:40:54.163
<v Mark> Yes, that is a really good one.

00:40:54.704 --> 00:40:56.532
Jessie, I'm sure
you have thoughts on this.

00:40:56.593 --> 00:40:58.420
If you want to go first, you can.

00:41:01.750 --> 00:41:03.878
Jessie: I was going to say,
I think that all three of the steps

00:41:03.906 --> 00:41:09.897
that we went through today
in detail are really good starting points.

00:41:10.055 --> 00:41:11.073
<v Mark> Yes.

00:41:11.105 --> 00:41:16.077
Now, for a small team
that doesn't have automation tools

00:41:16.109 --> 00:41:17.870
or code reviews,

00:41:19.157 --> 00:41:22.124
so to Jessie's point,
you can still use those same steps.

00:41:22.212 --> 00:41:23.487
Hear me out.

00:41:23.709 --> 00:41:28.623
Instead of automation
like the UI testing and linters,

00:41:28.719 --> 00:41:30.018
use a browser extension.

00:41:30.153 --> 00:41:31.823
You can use an Axe browser extension,

00:41:31.843 --> 00:41:33.424
you could use Lighthouse,
anything like that,

00:41:33.444 --> 00:41:35.256
because those same things
that we're talking about

00:41:35.276 --> 00:41:37.007
where I use automation,

00:41:37.027 --> 00:41:39.294
I have developers check stuff as they go.

00:41:40.178 --> 00:41:41.354
You can have them check things.

00:41:41.374 --> 00:41:42.647
We're not enforcing it.

00:41:42.692 --> 00:41:46.435
We go to step two with a code review--
Sorry, not a code review,

00:41:46.455 --> 00:41:49.310
but you can set steps in play to say,
"Hey,

00:41:49.488 --> 00:41:54.828
I want you to check with Axe
or Wave or whatever it is,

00:41:54.966 --> 00:41:57.418
and make sure
there's no issues before that."

00:41:57.575 --> 00:42:00.900
I would start there, especially with teams
that are newer to things.

00:42:00.934 --> 00:42:03.215
Sometimes there are teams,

00:42:03.391 --> 00:42:05.673
full disclosure, that have no UI testing

00:42:05.798 --> 00:42:08.206
or linting pieces
or any processes in place,

00:42:08.252 --> 00:42:09.252
new or not.

00:42:09.873 --> 00:42:11.834
Go to the browser extensions right away.

00:42:11.858 --> 00:42:15.265
The one thing I'll say is be consistent
in what you use.

00:42:15.285 --> 00:42:17.603
Don't cross over
different browser extensions.

00:42:17.623 --> 00:42:19.373
Use one and stick to it

00:42:19.393 --> 00:42:22.965
so you all are talking apples to apples
and not apples to bananas

00:42:23.049 --> 00:42:25.969
as I tell my son when he tells me things
that don't make sense.

00:42:26.766 --> 00:42:28.648
So that's where
I would start though with that,

00:42:28.668 --> 00:42:30.190
is using the extension

00:42:30.210 --> 00:42:31.767
and use the steps like Jessie said.

00:42:31.787 --> 00:42:34.795
You can still use those steps
and use them along the way.

00:42:34.815 --> 00:42:36.458
You just have to retrofit it then with

00:42:36.478 --> 00:42:39.238
using the extension
instead of using code reviews

00:42:39.258 --> 00:42:43.250
and automated accessibility tools
like Axe, like in DevPipeline.

00:42:47.116 --> 00:42:48.853
<v Piccia> Yes, Jessie, you're happy.

00:42:48.935 --> 00:42:50.719
Do you have anything to add?

00:42:51.067 --> 00:42:53.277
Good. I'm fascinated that

00:42:53.297 --> 00:42:59.726
you recommend using just one extension.

00:42:59.746 --> 00:43:00.563
That's very interesting.

00:43:00.610 --> 00:43:02.006
We have too many questions.

00:43:02.706 --> 00:43:05.110
The next question is from Isla.

00:43:05.225 --> 00:43:11.648
"Do laws ever come into the conversation
not to scare your team,

00:43:11.737 --> 00:43:13.525
but how to stay consistent in a world

00:43:13.545 --> 00:43:17.418
where nation-states are different stages
and different editions of WCAG?"

00:43:17.503 --> 00:43:19.515
I think that your company doesn't.

00:43:19.535 --> 00:43:23.545
It's very US-specific,
but in a lot of cases,

00:43:23.565 --> 00:43:28.426
there's also Europe, Asia
and Australia to take into account.

00:43:28.625 --> 00:43:33.115
<v Mark> Yes,
so I can say the accessibility team,

00:43:33.135 --> 00:43:36.602
so like normally when we work
with different companies, not just ours,

00:43:36.636 --> 00:43:39.777
we look at all the different workings
as far as

00:43:39.857 --> 00:43:42.507
where things are going with WCAG,
where are stuff going with federal laws,

00:43:42.527 --> 00:43:44.610
where are things going
with the European Accessibility Act,

00:43:44.685 --> 00:43:46.625
all the different things
across the board to see

00:43:46.802 --> 00:43:48.356
if it affects that.

00:43:48.484 --> 00:43:51.602
The answer is do laws
come into the conversation?

00:43:53.706 --> 00:43:54.743
Short and sweet,

00:43:54.865 --> 00:43:55.927
I'll say yes.

00:43:55.957 --> 00:43:57.922
If it comes down to
it's people not understanding

00:43:57.942 --> 00:43:59.366
why you're doing what you're doing,

00:43:59.404 --> 00:44:01.409
that kind of comes
into the education piece of it,

00:44:01.429 --> 00:44:03.591
which wasn't in this specifically,

00:44:03.611 --> 00:44:05.212
but it does come down
to that to understand,

00:44:05.232 --> 00:44:08.678
"Hey, this is why we're doing
what we're doing."

00:44:09.246 --> 00:44:11.674
Normally,
I don't go that route very bluntly.

00:44:11.700 --> 00:44:14.483
I try to stick to,
"We're doing this for the users.

00:44:14.503 --> 00:44:16.345
We're doing this to make
our content more accessible."

00:44:16.365 --> 00:44:19.377
However, you always get people
that come to the fold of like, "Yes,

00:44:19.397 --> 00:44:20.871
but is there a legal reason?"

00:44:20.891 --> 00:44:22.775
Then you kind of have
to take the gavel down and go,

00:44:22.796 --> 00:44:23.796
"Yes,"

00:44:23.816 --> 00:44:26.317
and explain all the different pieces
that are on there.

00:44:27.003 --> 00:44:28.003
You are correct.

00:44:28.023 --> 00:44:32.076
This is why we said the last step piece
that Jessie was talking about in this,

00:44:33.004 --> 00:44:35.093
the constantly changing
and evolving piece.

00:44:35.113 --> 00:44:35.814
That's part of that.

00:44:35.834 --> 00:44:37.821
A step could be,

00:44:37.896 --> 00:44:40.165
"Hey, this European Accessibility Act
is coming into play

00:44:40.185 --> 00:44:42.098
and we need to make sure
we do this, this, and this.

00:44:42.167 --> 00:44:44.304
Let's make this a step
as we start evolving that culture

00:44:44.324 --> 00:44:47.224
so everybody's aware that these things
are coming down the pipe,"

00:44:47.265 --> 00:44:48.331
and it's going to happen.

00:44:49.104 --> 00:44:50.744
That's how we deal with it.

00:44:50.771 --> 00:44:52.601
We don't wholesale be like, "Yes,

00:44:52.775 --> 00:44:55.049
you know, here comes WCAG 2.2, good luck."

00:44:55.375 --> 00:44:57.433
No, we're going to, "Hey, this is coming,

00:44:57.454 --> 00:44:59.578
coming down the pipe so everybody knows,
here's gonna be our requirements,

00:44:59.598 --> 00:45:01.241
we're gonna do this in a few years."

00:45:01.847 --> 00:45:05.244
Know that yes, but at the end of the day,

00:45:05.264 --> 00:45:09.223
I don't personally
try to go to the scare tactic

00:45:09.577 --> 00:45:14.452
until someone starts to ask the question,
legally, why are we doing this?

00:45:14.723 --> 00:45:17.203
Normally,
we try to go from the user standpoint.

00:45:20.557 --> 00:45:24.615
<v Piccia> I have to say that as someone
who works independently,

00:45:24.668 --> 00:45:25.977
I totally agree with you.

00:45:25.997 --> 00:45:29.925
If anything, usually I would go
with the business opportunity.

00:45:29.945 --> 00:45:32.263
That's the best way to go about it.

00:45:32.397 --> 00:45:36.487
I have to say that
I'm so thankful for things like the EAA,

00:45:36.513 --> 00:45:38.167
the European Accessibility Act

00:45:38.251 --> 00:45:41.827
because a lot of companies
are really now going,

00:45:41.856 --> 00:45:43.970
"Right, okay, now we need to do it."

00:45:44.161 --> 00:45:45.927
That's brilliant, you know?

00:45:45.948 --> 00:45:50.006
So in a way, yes, and being, you know,

00:45:50.026 --> 00:45:53.097
it's never a good thing
to be scaremongering,

00:45:53.117 --> 00:45:56.273
but it's good that
legislation is happening.

00:45:56.371 --> 00:45:59.193
Now we have another
really good question

00:45:59.220 --> 00:46:01.743
from Rosita Rampetap,

00:46:02.193 --> 00:46:07.421
and they ask,
"How do you deal with accessibility costs,

00:46:07.442 --> 00:46:10.011
a lot of money,
or people with disabilities

00:46:10.031 --> 00:46:16.857
aren't our audience kind of questions,
kind of counterarguments?

00:46:16.970 --> 00:46:21.038
As a developer with a disability,
I hear that often."

00:46:23.676 --> 00:46:25.933
<v Mark> Frio, do you want
to take a stab at it?

00:46:27.903 --> 00:46:30.416
Jessie: I assume that the cost,

00:46:30.436 --> 00:46:34.917
a lot of money kind of
gets at the same thing

00:46:34.937 --> 00:46:40.184
that we were talking about with
it takes so much time and effort,

00:46:40.206 --> 00:46:44.275
and we have to go back
and redo all our code.

00:46:44.295 --> 00:46:49.910
I do think that trying
to integrate into the culture

00:46:50.143 --> 00:46:53.244
combats the money argument,

00:46:53.264 --> 00:46:59.104
at least a little unless I'm completely
missing something from that perspective.

00:46:59.643 --> 00:47:02.847
I mean, I think
in terms of target audience,

00:47:02.867 --> 00:47:06.774
it's what we just talked about with,
there is a business case,

00:47:06.794 --> 00:47:09.017
like if they're not your target audience,

00:47:09.243 --> 00:47:11.000
maybe they should be.

00:47:14.646 --> 00:47:16.533
<v Mark> I'll add to what you just said.

00:47:17.617 --> 00:47:19.100
Here's how I do it.

00:47:19.293 --> 00:47:21.023
If somebody gives me that piece,

00:47:21.043 --> 00:47:24.276
so usually the fallacy that runs into
is everybody thinks that

00:47:24.296 --> 00:47:27.618
when we talk accessibility,
it's only screen reader users.

00:47:27.803 --> 00:47:31.333
What I tend to do is bring it down
to everybody else's level.

00:47:31.449 --> 00:47:33.832
The first thing I did a long time ago

00:47:33.852 --> 00:47:35.347
in a galaxy far, far away,
I'm just kidding.

00:47:35.387 --> 00:47:36.537
I had to get my Star Wars reference.

00:47:36.557 --> 00:47:38.328
I'm a Star Wars super fan.

00:47:38.465 --> 00:47:40.166
What I did a long time ago
was the first time

00:47:40.186 --> 00:47:43.910
we started talking about accessibility
at one of my older companies.

00:47:44.891 --> 00:47:47.128
It was the same argument of,

00:47:47.148 --> 00:47:49.291
it costs a lot of money,
we don't want to do that.

00:47:49.370 --> 00:47:50.644
I said, "That's awesome.

00:47:50.826 --> 00:47:53.991
How old are your average user base?"

00:47:54.044 --> 00:47:55.230
And they said,

00:47:55.423 --> 00:47:56.870
"Getting to their 50s."

00:47:56.883 --> 00:47:59.332
I said, "Awesome,
they're not getting any younger.

00:47:59.353 --> 00:48:02.169
I bet you, eyesight's going.

00:48:02.317 --> 00:48:05.274
Bet you that they're starting
to use different assistive technologies

00:48:05.294 --> 00:48:06.244
in their phone.

00:48:06.282 --> 00:48:08.936
I bet you, you use different
assistive technologies in your phone,

00:48:08.956 --> 00:48:09.800
do you not?

00:48:09.820 --> 00:48:12.309
So do you wanna keep
that millions of dollars

00:48:12.329 --> 00:48:13.587
that they have in your organization

00:48:13.607 --> 00:48:15.808
or do you want them to go, 'Well,
this company doesn't care about me,

00:48:15.829 --> 00:48:16.829
I'm out.'"

00:48:16.898 --> 00:48:21.148
And bring it to their level
to understand at a high level,

00:48:21.211 --> 00:48:23.211
it's not just like screen reader users.

00:48:24.352 --> 00:48:25.667
It's everybody with it.

00:48:25.687 --> 00:48:28.685
You're making products
holistically accessible for everyone.

00:48:29.537 --> 00:48:32.581
Then it starts
to just click a little bit more.

00:48:32.623 --> 00:48:35.660
I've had a lot more success
saying it that way

00:48:35.680 --> 00:48:37.663
and bring it to that level that way.

00:48:37.699 --> 00:48:40.997
Then, because again,
it just immediately just goes like

00:48:41.093 --> 00:48:43.318
what Jessie said,
"Oh, it's going to cost a ton of money.

00:48:43.338 --> 00:48:45.861
Oh my gosh,
we have to do all this Legacy code stuff."

00:48:45.882 --> 00:48:50.713
When you start to bring it into terms that
they somewhat understand,

00:48:50.733 --> 00:48:53.158
and I say they, like whoever is the one
who's bringing up like

00:48:53.178 --> 00:48:54.477
it costs money, all that.

00:48:54.517 --> 00:48:56.702
When you bring it down to their level
and bring it down to their terms

00:48:56.722 --> 00:48:59.746
that they understand,
it tends to stick a little bit more.

00:48:59.766 --> 00:49:01.702
It's like, "Why are we doing this?"

00:49:04.991 --> 00:49:08.881
<v Piccia> Yes,
I just like to remind everyone

00:49:08.901 --> 00:49:12.054
how we're only ever temporarily abled.

00:49:12.132 --> 00:49:17.487
I'll move on to the next question,
but that was so many good points.

00:49:17.507 --> 00:49:19.138
Thank you so much.

00:49:19.928 --> 00:49:24.688
Someone is asking what resources,
tools, or training

00:49:24.708 --> 00:49:27.043
have you found most helpful

00:49:27.097 --> 00:49:32.473
in making accessibility a natural part
of the development process?

00:49:32.557 --> 00:49:36.465
We've got like one minute
to answer this question.

00:49:36.793 --> 00:49:39.014
<v Mark> I'm going to turn this one to Jessie

00:49:39.043 --> 00:49:41.299
because Jessie is newer
to the accessibility field.

00:49:41.326 --> 00:49:44.157
I'll ask you if there's resources
that you had

00:49:44.262 --> 00:49:46.317
that you would suggest, Jessie.

00:49:47.990 --> 00:49:50.703
If you can't think
off the top of your head, it's okay.

00:49:52.807 --> 00:49:57.152
Jessie: Yes, I don't know
off the top of my head.

00:49:57.173 --> 00:50:00.029
I mean, I can think of

00:50:00.050 --> 00:50:03.542
authoring practice guides
for specific examples,

00:50:03.602 --> 00:50:10.570
but I don't know
where I got the more broad knowledge.

00:50:10.639 --> 00:50:13.800
<v Mark> The hush, hush, hush of stuff.

00:50:14.347 --> 00:50:17.343
There's always one on the top of my mind.

00:50:17.363 --> 00:50:19.295
I don't know who asked that question.

00:50:19.315 --> 00:50:20.582
Oh, it says anonymous attendee.

00:50:20.602 --> 00:50:22.270
It's okay. If that person knows us

00:50:22.290 --> 00:50:23.934
and can find us on LinkedIn,
you can ask us.

00:50:23.954 --> 00:50:26.427
That's one of those questions
where like I got resources.

00:50:26.447 --> 00:50:28.400
Just one of those things
where I have to look and be like,

00:50:28.421 --> 00:50:30.442
"Oh yeah, that. There is one."

00:50:31.270 --> 00:50:34.713
There's web.dev has
an accessibility course

00:50:34.733 --> 00:50:35.903
that's really good.

00:50:35.923 --> 00:50:37.617
If you're trying to get education pieces

00:50:37.637 --> 00:50:40.758
just for development practices
for getting that in there,

00:50:40.779 --> 00:50:41.849
there's that.

00:50:42.847 --> 00:50:44.726
That's a really good
training resource for it.

00:50:44.747 --> 00:50:46.608
Then tools-wise,

00:50:47.902 --> 00:50:50.146
if you're looking for tools,
I'm just going to say anything

00:50:50.182 --> 00:50:53.589
that is Axe-based
is probably the way to go.

00:50:53.708 --> 00:50:54.387
Just behind the scenes.

00:50:54.407 --> 00:50:55.503
Just because Axe Core is used

00:50:55.523 --> 00:50:58.821
to consistently in a bunch
of different extensions like Lighthouse,

00:50:59.292 --> 00:51:01.356
Insights, things like that
is like a core base.

00:51:01.478 --> 00:51:03.766
So if you're going to do that,
that'd be a good tool to go with.

00:51:03.786 --> 00:51:06.993
If you want more resources,
find me and Jessie on LinkedIn

00:51:07.014 --> 00:51:09.240
because I can't think of
[unintelligible 00:51:09]

00:51:09.261 --> 00:51:11.053
I haven't passed that either.

00:51:11.097 --> 00:51:13.953
<v Piccia> Yes,
it's probably too long to answer

00:51:13.973 --> 00:51:15.574
when you have one minute.

00:51:15.595 --> 00:51:18.607
That's all we have time for.

00:51:19.597 --> 00:51:22.647
Thank you so much to Jessie and Mark.

00:51:22.690 --> 00:51:26.143
Thanks for everyone
for attending this session.

00:51:26.169 --> 00:51:28.112
Like Mark and Jessie said,

00:51:28.132 --> 00:51:29.750
you can continue your conversation
with them,

00:51:29.810 --> 00:51:31.375
finding them on social media.

00:51:31.436 --> 00:51:34.291
Also reminding you of our hashtags,

00:51:34.423 --> 00:51:39.451
WPA11YDay,

00:51:39.531 --> 00:51:42.667
making sure you use the camel case.

00:51:42.790 --> 00:51:46.291
And WPAD2024.

00:51:46.461 --> 00:51:47.864

00:51:55.804 --> 00:51:56.850
to provide feedback.

00:51:56.870 --> 00:52:01.107
Maybe when the amazing focus

00:52:01.127 --> 00:52:04.139
is a feature, not a bug t-shirt.

00:52:04.160 --> 00:52:10.443
Also stay tuned
for the next session coming up,

00:52:10.463 --> 00:52:14.220
which is how to juggle different teams

00:52:14.240 --> 00:52:16.652
at different places
in their accessibility journeys.

00:52:16.672 --> 00:52:19.641
A perfect segue to the current one

00:52:20.053 --> 00:52:24.136
with Lorna Notch and Lorenzo Milani.

00:52:24.403 --> 00:52:29.158
Also why not make sure
that you go and visit our sponsors pages

00:52:29.178 --> 00:52:30.688
to grab the virtual swag

00:52:30.708 --> 00:52:34.164
and also enter
for a chance to win more prizes.

00:52:34.231 --> 00:52:36.079
Before you go,

00:52:36.132 --> 00:52:40.114
please let me thank
our live captioning people

00:52:40.134 --> 00:52:45.020
and our sign language interpreters
because they do an amazing job.

00:52:45.060 --> 00:52:48.177
Having said all this,
that was quite a mouthful,

00:52:48.543 --> 00:52:53.560
I will see you at the top of the hour
for the next session.

00:52:53.708 --> 00:52:55.638
