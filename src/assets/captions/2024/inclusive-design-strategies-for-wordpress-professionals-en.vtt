Announcer: WordPress
Accessibility Day 2024,

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:06.660
Inclusive Design Strategies
for WordPress Professionals,

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:07.140
with speaker Jonny Allbut,
Head of UX at Illustrate Digital.

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:13.980
This presentation was
recorded October 2024.

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:16.300
Yigakpoa Samuel Ikpae: Hi, everyone,

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:20.740
and welcome to WordPress
Accessibility Day 2024.

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:22.620
My name is Yigakpoa Ikpae.

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.660
I am COO from [?].

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.260
Thank you for joining us
for Inclusive Design Strategies

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.980
for WordPress Professionals
from Jonny Allbut.

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:35.780
Jonny Allbut
is the Head of User Experience

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.740
and Quality Assurance
at Illustrate Digital,

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:43.220
one of Europe's leading UX
and WordPress technology agencies.

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:47.060
Starting his career
as a traditional graphic designer,

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.500
he's been building websites
since the late '90s

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:55.140
and specialized in bespoke WordPress
development since 2025.

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.940

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:09.580
to build the best digital experiences
for clients and their users.

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.620
Remember to add your questions
in the question and A section,

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.540
and we'll answer them
at the end of the section.

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:20.980
Don't forget to use the chat
to connect with other attendees.

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.620
Hi, Jonny, over to you.

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.740
Jonny Allbut: Hi, thank you so much
for that wonderful introduction.

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:28.300
Wow.

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.140
Couldn't have done a better job myself.

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:31.340
Hi, everyone.

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.700
Thanks for joining us wherever you are.

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.220
It's the start of the day here in the UK.

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.220
It's 8 AM
and I cannot think of a better way

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.780
to kick off my day
than with you here right now.

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.220
I'm so excited to be part
of WordPress Accessibility Day this year.

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.020
I have so much to share with you today.

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:52.220
My name is Jonny.

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.220
With over 25 years of industry
experience working with global brands

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.380
and market leaders,
I now head up user experience

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.580
at Illustrate Digital where I've
worked for three and a half years.

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.700
We deliver bespoke-enterprise
level WordPress development

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.540
backed up
by great UX research and creative.

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:14.740
I've personally been working
with WordPress since 2005

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.660
and have spoken at a few work camps and
other meetups around the UK in the past.

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:24.100
A commitment to accessibility
was one of the main things

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.020
that drew me to Illustrate Digital.

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.220
The ongoing commitment
to creating inclusive

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:34.860
and accessible websites that look
amazing very strongly resonates with me.

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.900
Now I have the opportunity to achieve this

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.300
for clients all around the world together
with our brilliant team.

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.100
Today, we're going
to look over some ideas,

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.100
strategies and tools
that I've learned over the years

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:51.500
and share some useful insights

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.860
into how we approach accessibility here
at Illustrate Digital.

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.260
Before we really get going,

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.300
I think it's important
to understand our motivations.

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:04.900
If you're here,
you're interested in accessibility

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.500
and quite likely
an advocate yourself.

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:08.780
Brilliant.

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.940
However, sadly,
not everyone shares our passion

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:17.420
and sense of responsibility
to open and accessible websites.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.500
Obviously, a pretty big mistake
for so many reasons.

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:28.620
Let's take a quick look
at where we are at on web accessibility.

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.940
As reported
by the World Health Organization,

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:37.380
16% of the world's population or 1 in 6

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.900
of us experience significant disability.

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.980
That's an estimated 1.3 billion people.

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:46.780
Just let that sink in for a while.

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:47.780
It's a big number.

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:56.340
If I look closer to home
at UK census data to identify disability

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:58.940
in England and Wales, it was asked,

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:02.500
"Do you have a physical
or mental health condition

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:07.380
or illness lasting or expecting
to last 12 months or more?"

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:11.940
If respondents answered yes,
a further question was asked.

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:16.540
"Do any of your conditions
or illnesses reduce your ability

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:19.820
to carry out day-to-day activities?"

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:22.980
I'm not going
to dwell too much on the stats.

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.980
I'm sure there'll be some
really interesting stuff coming today

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:28.660
in other presentations.

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:33.540
What I'd like you to think about
for a moment is averages.

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:38.900
In the UK, the English region
with the highest population

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:45.500
of disabled people was the northeast,
21.2%, over half a million people.

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:50.060
There's a number of areas
with much higher proportions too,

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.740
reaching over 24%.

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:54.460
For instance, in Blackpool.

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:59.060
When we think globally,
it's a much darker picture.

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:02.780
Poverty, access to assistive technologies

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:06.100
or even any quality technology,

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:10.700
all these are intertwined
to create much more alarming figures.

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:15.020
A lot of us are spoilt
with access to powerful computers

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:18.740
and mobile devices
but something to always consider

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:22.380
is the digital poverty technology gap.

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:25.060
Digital accessibility

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:29.660
is not just about professional
best practice or something to upsell.

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:31.420
It's a human right.

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:35.500
As developers,
creators and decision makers,

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:39.660
we have a duty to craft
inclusive digital experiences,

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:44.860
the respect, the dignity,
and autonomy of every user.

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:49.140
Accessibility
is a cornerstone of all our work here

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:52.340
at Illustrate Digital
and should be yours, too.

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:56.980
Finally, also consider we have
an ageing population in the world

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:00.500
and life expectancy
is generally increasing.

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:04.980
With that in mind,
we need to consider that the importance

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:09.820
of accessibility is only set
to rise as time goes on,

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:13.420
as our population progressively ages,

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:18.220
which inevitably comes
with health and accessibility challenges.

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:20.820
With all this in mind, though,

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:25.780
we also have to balance
this passion with commercial challenges.

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:30.620
We need to consider the needs,
priorities and budgets of our clients.

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:34.740
This leads us to some questions
that you may encounter.

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:39.860
As we embark on our journey

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:43.060
to understand how
to effectively implement accessibility,

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:47.260
it's important to address
some common concerns that often arise.

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:51.620
These questions reflect
a broader challenge many face

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:54.340
when considering accessibility
and web design.

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:56.620
These sound a bit familiar to you,

00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:00.100
but doesn't sporting
accessibility cost me more?

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:04.380
What about accessible website design

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:06.500
means I will have a boring looking site?

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:09.860
I'm sure if you've been
in the industry for a while,

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:13.060
you'll have heard something similar
like this in the past.

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:17.660
I'm just going to give you a bit
of a spoiler or reveal right now.

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:21.540
No, no, it really doesn't to both of those.

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:25.460
In fact, it's likely
to cost your client a lot more

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:28.060
in the long run to ignore accessibility.

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:30.580
We're going to cover some strategies

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:34.060
and approaches to help you
combat assumptions like these

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:36.540
throughout this entire presentation.

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:44.740
Let's start thinking a little bit more
from a commercial angle here.

00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:50.740
Inclusive design and accessibility
are not just ethical considerations.

00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:54.900
To me, they are strategic business decisions.

00:07:55.420 --> 00:08:00.180
By making our website successful,
we reach a broader audience.

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:01.700
Very, very simple.

00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:08.620
As we saw, 16% of the global population
is living with some form

00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:13.260
of disability or challenge,
representing a market opportunity

00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:18.380
of literally not millions,
trillions of dollars.

00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:22.220
I find money talks pretty loud
when it comes to clients.

00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:25.820
Demonstrating a commitment to inclusivity

00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:29.660
through accessible
design builds brand loyalty.

00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:36.420
You can literally destroy years or even
decades of positive brand perception

00:08:36.660 --> 00:08:40.580
by excluding users
from your site or digital product.

00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:47.580
Accessibility features like clear
navigation enhance usability for everyone,

00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:52.180
increasing engagement
and conversion rates across the board.

00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:55.340
I'm not going to get into SEO.

00:08:55.460 --> 00:08:57.300
I'm not an SEO specialist.

00:08:57.420 --> 00:08:59.540
I know some fundamentals,

00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:03.540
but it's recognized
that many accessibility best practices

00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:06.420
actually align
with SEO best practices,

00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:11.100
which could have a positive influence
on things like search engine rankings.

00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:16.100
Probably the biggest one
for clients in many territories,

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:20.580
accessibility helps us comply
with legal standards,

00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:23.020
avoiding costly lawsuits.

00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:26.700
I'm sure we're all aware
of some pretty scary numbers

00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:27.980
around this kind of stuff.

00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:30.300
There's the old example,

00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:33.220
and I'm sure that's probably
been mentioned or will be mentioned later.

00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:37.020
Back from 2008,
when the National Federation

00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:43.300
of the Blind versus Target
Corporation resulted in a settlement

00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:48.660
of $6 million in damages,
plus additional fees,

00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:54.020
which actually amounted
to approximately $10 million.

00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:59.740
Legal cases are on the rise and sometimes
cases are settled outside of court.

00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:03.300
Don't just think
because you're not a global mega-corp,

00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:06.220
you can hide under a rock
and escape this risk.

00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:08.020
You can't.

00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:13.020
Prioritizing accessibility
is not just the right thing to do,

00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:16.620
it's a wise business move
that can benefit your clients,

00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:21.140
revenue and, of course,
all the users we serve.

00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:27.020
Let's start looking at how accessibility
considerations effectively fit

00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:29.780
into an agency production process.

00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:35.300
Accessibility
should never be an afterthought.

00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:39.180
Avoid the costly mistake
of thinking accessibility

00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:41.980
can be dealt with near
the end of a project.

00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:46.140
That will cost you money
and cost you a lot of stress.

00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:50.460
To ensure that our websites
and digital products are accessible to all,

00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:54.900
we need to integrate accessibility
into every stage

00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:57.580
of our workflow from start to finish.

00:10:58.460 --> 00:11:00.460
Let's start with the sales team.

00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:03.940
It's essential that
they are aware of the importance

00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:08.220
of accessibility
and can communicate its value to clients.

00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:14.460
By setting clear expectations and identifying
potential accessibility challenges,

00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:18.820
we can ensure that our clients
are on board with us from day one

00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:21.340
with our accessibility goals.

00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:26.180
This might actually just be the very
thing that wins you your next project.

00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:29.620
As we move
into project planning,

00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:33.060
our project managers play
a crucial role in planning

00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:36.500
for accessibility from the outset.

00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:39.860
This includes understanding
accessibility goals

00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:43.580
and priorities
and allocating necessary resources

00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:46.020
to support accessibility efforts.

00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:49.220
We're very lucky at Illustrate Digital.

00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:53.180
All of our developers
are very knowledgeable about accessibility,

00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:59.420
but in every team,
there are real accessibility champions so allocation

00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:04.140
of the right expertise
at the right time is absolutely vital.

00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:08.140
In the design phase,
our UX designers

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:12.540
must create inclusive designs
that consider diverse user needs.

00:12:13.340 --> 00:12:16.820
By following established
accessibility guidelines

00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:20.180
and, of course,
the expertise of those team members,

00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:23.100
we ensure
that we are agreeing to develop

00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:30.780
using all best practices
of accessibility right from day one.

00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:33.580
Start your project with strong foundations.

00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:37.900
Do not make the mistake
of creating UI designs

00:12:38.060 --> 00:12:41.660
that have not got accessibility
built into them.

00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:44.300
When it comes to development,

00:12:44.460 --> 00:12:47.380
our developers
must write accessible code

00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:50.180
that meets established accessibility standards.

00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:53.500
To be fair,
this is probably more weighted

00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:55.940
to our front-end devs in many cases.

00:12:57.100 --> 00:13:01.500
Throughout testing
and debugging, all of that is critical

00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:04.940
to ensure accessibility features
are working correctly.

00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:09.020
This is where QA
or quality assurance comes in.

00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:11.580
Our QA process is thorough.

00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:15.820
I have the greatest of respect
for any QA testers out there.

00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:19.540
They need a very deep knowledge
of so many things,

00:13:19.780 --> 00:13:24.420
but obviously accessibility
is right up there at the top of the list.

00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:29.660
Accessibility doesn't stop
with just what we develop.

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:34.740
We need to educate and get buy-in
from our clients around accessibility.

00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:39.860
Encourage them to provide feedback,
train them, mentor them,

00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:45.500
and more importantly,
ensure what they are publishing is accessible.

00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:50.380
Finally, post go-live in the support
and maintenance phase,

00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:54.540
we need to ensure
that our accessibility features are maintained

00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:58.940
and updated over time as new techniques
and technologies come along.

00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:03.380
Regular monitoring
for accessibility issues

00:14:03.580 --> 00:14:07.660
and addressing concerns
are essential to ensuring

00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:11.580
that our digital products
remain accessible to all.

00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:17.700
By integrating accessibility
into every stage of your workflow,

00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:23.060
we can ensure that
our digital products are accessible, usable,

00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:25.980
and inclusive for all users.

00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:30.540
Let's take a look at some
of these functions in a bit more detail.

00:14:31.140 --> 00:14:36.820
For our internal agency sales team,
highlighting accessibility

00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:40.980
is a competitive advantage
and framing it as a solution

00:14:41.180 --> 00:14:44.740
to client pain points
can help demonstrate the value

00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:47.140
and our commitment to accessibility.

00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:52.780
Compelling stats on accessibility
can also help make the case

00:14:52.900 --> 00:14:55.020
for prioritizing accessibility.

00:14:55.500 --> 00:15:00.140
Dig deep,
consider what's relevant and will resonate

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:04.100
with your client
rather than just general statistics.

00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:08.540
There's plenty of credible
information out there to back up your case.

00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:12.060
Project managers,
again, of course, as mentioned,

00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:14.940
need to share the value
and importance of accessibility.

00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:19.580
It's essential
to integrate accessibility milestones

00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:23.420
into workflows
and manage stakeholder expectations

00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:25.620
around accessibility compliance.

00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:30.780
By balancing accessibility
with other project constraints,

00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:36.460
we can ensure that accessibility
is not compromised at any stage.

00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:40.820
Finally, our internal support staff
play a critical role

00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:45.260
in providing ongoing support
and education for client teams.

00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:51.660
By utilizing accessibility resources
and encouraging accessibility best practices

00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:54.300
with our team, with our clients,

00:15:54.860 --> 00:15:59.660
we can help clients maintain
and improve accessibility over time.

00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:06.220
This is obviously one
that's very close to my heart

00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:08.380
as head of user experience.

00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:13.540
This is where we need to build
strong accessibility foundations right

00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:14.540
from the start of the project.

00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:17.860
Whilst there's certainly
some considerations

00:16:18.020 --> 00:16:21.020
around appropriate UX research
to understand users,

00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:24.940
I'm going to focus mainly
on the UI design process here,

00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:27.860
as I feel it's probably
what's most relevant

00:16:27.980 --> 00:16:30.420
to a larger proportion
of the audience today.

00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:32.700
Believe me, I could go on all day

00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:36.380
if we had time just
on this slide but time is precious.

00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:41.460
First, let's talk about empathy
and user-centric design.

00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:46.860
It's essential to consider
the diverse needs of all users

00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:50.340
by putting ourselves
in the shoes of our users.

00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:54.620
We can design experiences
that are truly inclusive.

00:16:56.740 --> 00:16:59.740
Next, we need
to maintain contextual awareness.

00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:04.020
This means understanding
of where, when,

00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:07.860
and how people are using
our websites and digital products.

00:17:08.340 --> 00:17:10.940
Are they using a mobile device on the go?

00:17:11.060 --> 00:17:13.340
Are they in a noisy environment?

00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:15.540
Are they in an office environment?

00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:21.180
These factors can significantly impact
how users interact with our designs.

00:17:22.820 --> 00:17:27.420
Cognitive load management
is another crucial aspect.

00:17:27.620 --> 00:17:30.740
Let me just explain
what that means in a nutshell.

00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:37.540
Don't make your users work too hard
or have to think too hard

00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:41.820
to figure out how to use
your website or user interface.

00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:47.060
We must strive to make our interfaces
easy to understand for everyone.

00:17:47.220 --> 00:17:51.380
This involves obvious things
like simplifying navigation,

00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:56.420
site architecture,
using very clear language with clear intent

00:17:56.540 --> 00:18:00.900
and ensuring that information
is organized and presented

00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:02.460
in a logical order.

00:18:03.620 --> 00:18:07.780
Finally, inclusive design principles
should guide our work.

00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:13.140
Our goal is to create great
user experiences for all users,

00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:16.980
regardless of their abilities
or circumstances.

00:18:17.580 --> 00:18:23.460
This means designing with accessibility
in mind from the very beginning.

00:18:25.340 --> 00:18:27.860
Now, when we think about
action points around this,

00:18:28.580 --> 00:18:32.420
collaboration
with developers is key.

00:18:32.620 --> 00:18:36.020
If there's one thing I want you
to take away from this slide,

00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:37.340
it's that point.

00:18:37.780 --> 00:18:43.140
We need to understand what can
and can't be achieved technically

00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:48.180
and work together to implement
accessibility features effectively.

00:18:49.100 --> 00:18:55.140
Implementing WCAG guidelines,
well, it's non-negotiable.

00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:58.980
These guidelines help us
create designs that are easy

00:18:59.060 --> 00:19:03.100
to understand and operate
for users with diverse needs.

00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:07.700
They cover a vast range
of things such as color contrast,

00:19:07.860 --> 00:19:11.500
keyboard navigation,
all kinds of stuff.

00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:16.420
Dig deep,
let that be your North Star there.

00:19:16.580 --> 00:19:21.220
When crafting user stories,
which are brief explanations

00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:25.300
of how a particular content block
or component will work,

00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:28.900
it's important to ensure
they reflect the functionality

00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:32.060
needed to support our accessible vision.

00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:36.260
Lastly, UI consistency is vital.

00:19:36.860 --> 00:19:42.900
While creativity is important,
we should avoid unnecessary variations

00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:44.820
that might confuse users.

00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:50.020
As an aside on that, that will help reduce
your development costs as well a little.

00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:53.860
By focusing
on these awareness points and actions,

00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:58.220
we can ensure that our designs
are not only aesthetically pleasing,

00:19:58.380 --> 00:20:01.940
but also accessible
and inclusive for everyone.

00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:07.780
A key takeaway here I'd like you
to remember is that accessibility

00:20:07.900 --> 00:20:12.660
is not just a tick-box exercise
about compliance.

00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:20.060
It's about creating inclusive designs
that consider the diverse needs of users.

00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:23.260
An interesting observation, if I may,

00:20:23.380 --> 00:20:27.140
is that we found that designing
with accessibility in mind

00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:33.380
often actually produces
even better UX for all users,

00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:35.180
regardless of disability.

00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:40.380
Now let's talk about developers.

00:20:40.540 --> 00:20:43.540
These are the guys
that make the magic happen.

00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:47.420
They obviously play a key role
in creating functional

00:20:47.540 --> 00:20:49.820
and accessible digital experiences.

00:20:50.220 --> 00:20:55.100
I've pulled out some of the most important
considerations and actions here.

00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:59.460
First, it's essential
to emphasize again the importance

00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:03.300
of continuous learning
and especially knowledge sharing.

00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:07.740
Stay current
with new requirements, best practices,

00:21:07.860 --> 00:21:10.060
and especially emerging technologies.

00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:15.020
That ensures that we're always
improving our accessibility efforts.

00:21:16.180 --> 00:21:19.140
There's some really interesting things going on

00:21:19.220 --> 00:21:21.780
with even just simple CSS techniques.

00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:25.460
One of the easiest to implement
is using reduced motion.

00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:26.900
Look it up.

00:21:27.060 --> 00:21:32.620
I won't explain it in great detail,
but that is like a silver bullet.

00:21:32.700 --> 00:21:34.340
It's really fantastic.

00:21:35.140 --> 00:21:38.420
Continuous learning
includes participating in workshops,

00:21:38.580 --> 00:21:41.020
attending conferences
just like this one,

00:21:41.140 --> 00:21:44.660
and engaging
with online communities to stay up to date.

00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:48.940
Next, planning accessibility tasks
is crucial.

00:21:49.820 --> 00:21:54.180
Organizing tasks into relevant back-end
or front-end departments

00:21:54.340 --> 00:21:55.620
helps streamline

00:21:55.700 --> 00:21:58.900
our approach and ensures
that accessibility is considered

00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:01.260
throughout the development process.

00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:05.780
This includes identifying
potential accessibility challenges

00:22:05.940 --> 00:22:08.620
and allocating resources accordingly.

00:22:09.100 --> 00:22:12.420
Remember, I mentioned about
accessibility champions and teams.

00:22:12.620 --> 00:22:16.500
Make sure the right people
are in the right place at the right time.

00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:21.060
Development efficiency is also vital

00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:23.940
if you are going
to make it cost effective.

00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:29.460
If we work really hard to solve
an accessibility issue, document it,

00:22:29.740 --> 00:22:35.380
make it reusable, extend it,
get it ready for the next project.

00:22:35.820 --> 00:22:40.140
This not only saves time,
but also ensures that our solutions

00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:42.700
are consistent and scalable.

00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:46.180
I think about actionable steps here.

00:22:46.580 --> 00:22:49.460
I'm going to keep on hammering
this point on collaboration

00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:51.140
and feedback are essential.

00:22:51.540 --> 00:22:55.300
By identifying challenges
and collaborating to solve them,

00:22:55.420 --> 00:23:01.940
we can make sure the accessibility efforts
are comprehensive and effective.

00:23:03.060 --> 00:23:04.620
Testing consistency.

00:23:04.700 --> 00:23:09.620
This is a tricky one
and a challenge for many teams

00:23:09.780 --> 00:23:11.260
that collaborate together.

00:23:11.740 --> 00:23:14.100
Agreeing on a standard set of tools

00:23:14.220 --> 00:23:17.260
and tests for the whole team
to use helps ensure

00:23:17.420 --> 00:23:20.060
that our accessibility testing
is thorough,

00:23:20.580 --> 00:23:24.100
reliable and more importantly, consistent.

00:23:24.620 --> 00:23:27.460
We'll talk a little bit more
about testing later on.

00:23:28.020 --> 00:23:29.860
At Illustrate Digital,

00:23:29.980 --> 00:23:33.220
we've developed a comprehensive
in-house process around this.

00:23:34.020 --> 00:23:35.500
Think of it like a checklist.

00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:39.820
This has guidance on what
to look out for, common errors,

00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:41.900
and the right tool to use.

00:23:43.140 --> 00:23:49.220
Finally, using semantic HTML structures
and things like ARIA attributes

00:23:49.380 --> 00:23:54.140
and correct labelling
on form fields are basically essential

00:23:54.300 --> 00:23:56.060
for enhancing accessibility.

00:23:56.860 --> 00:24:01.420
Semantic HTML provides
a clear structure for our content,

00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:06.620
making it easier for screen readers
and other assistive technologies to interpret.

00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:10.900
Please, please,
don't force HTML

00:24:11.020 --> 00:24:14.700
to do something it wasn't intended
to do just to match a design.

00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:19.820
Always use the most semantic
markup you can with valid HTML.

00:24:20.300 --> 00:24:22.300
Consideration here.

00:24:23.060 --> 00:24:26.780
Consider using CSS classes
to achieve semantic ordering

00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:31.700
of HTML tags when
the visual design doesn't reflect the needs,

00:24:31.780 --> 00:24:33.020
the layout of client.

00:24:33.140 --> 00:24:41.860
Please, just don't use heading tags
just for styling, as many people do.

00:24:42.460 --> 00:24:46.980
If you need a H2 tag heading
to look like an H4,

00:24:47.140 --> 00:24:49.860
just add a CSS class
to achieve this.

00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:51.620
It's really very simple.

00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:54.620
Just following
those last couple of things

00:24:54.700 --> 00:24:56.940
will solve many
of your accessibility issues.

00:24:57.380 --> 00:25:01.780
Semantic ordering
and just extra CSS class on styling

00:25:01.900 --> 00:25:07.020
and, of course, valid HTML,
it will solve all kind of issues for you.

00:25:07.340 --> 00:25:09.140
Test, test, test as you develop.

00:25:09.220 --> 00:25:10.780
Do not wait until the end.

00:25:12.860 --> 00:25:16.580
That neatly moves us on
to testing from start to finish.

00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:24.020
Testing for accessibility
should never be considered a one time task.

00:25:24.460 --> 00:25:28.500
It's a continuous process
that requires shared responsibility

00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:31.060
throughout the production lifecycle.

00:25:31.780 --> 00:25:35.580
To ensure thorough
and reliable testing,

00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:40.660
it's essential to develop
and document a consisting testing process,

00:25:40.820 --> 00:25:41.900
as I've mentioned.

00:25:42.060 --> 00:25:47.180
More importantly, keep that up to date
as new tools get discovered,

00:25:47.340 --> 00:25:49.820
as things improve, as things change.

00:25:49.940 --> 00:25:53.060
Please, this is not a one hit wonder.

00:25:53.180 --> 00:25:56.820
You need to actually keep
that testing process up to date.

00:25:56.980 --> 00:26:00.620
Again, I'm going
to keep on saying this,

00:26:00.740 --> 00:26:05.020
but collaboration truly is the key
when resolving technical issues.

00:26:05.460 --> 00:26:10.980
Adapting UI designs just increases
the knowledge across the whole team.

00:26:12.340 --> 00:26:14.620
A word on automated testing tools.

00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:18.660
They can really be useful,
but please be aware

00:26:18.860 --> 00:26:22.860
that they do require manual interpretation
to ensure accurate results.

00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:27.660
Do not blindly trust
accessibility testing tools.

00:26:28.180 --> 00:26:32.580
Really effective accessibility testing
requires some knowledge,

00:26:32.740 --> 00:26:34.420
some learnings.

00:26:34.620 --> 00:26:37.260
When it comes
to prioritizing exceptions,

00:26:37.380 --> 00:26:41.660
it's crucial to grade them
on seriousness and please focus

00:26:41.780 --> 00:26:45.700
on resolving those
that affect important functionality.

00:26:47.020 --> 00:26:48.900
Minor exceptions can come up,

00:26:49.340 --> 00:26:51.740
but they should be
documented during testing

00:26:51.940 --> 00:26:55.700
and added to the accessibility
statement to provide transparency.

00:26:55.860 --> 00:26:57.940
Please try and keep those to a minimum.

00:26:58.500 --> 00:27:01.980
Regular audits can also be
very useful in identifying

00:27:02.140 --> 00:27:06.540
and addressing issues proactively,
ensuring that accessibility

00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:08.660
is maintained over time.

00:27:09.460 --> 00:27:14.300
This includes tools,
as I've mentioned, around validating HTML,

00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:18.260
assess document outlines
and ensure semantic ordering.

00:27:18.820 --> 00:27:21.580
We'll touch upon
a few tools a little later on.

00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:24.100
By following these best practices

00:27:24.220 --> 00:27:26.940
and maintaining consistent
testing process

00:27:27.100 --> 00:27:29.500
throughout
the entire production lifecycle,

00:27:29.620 --> 00:27:32.900
we can ensure that our website
and digital products

00:27:33.060 --> 00:27:36.740
are accessible
and usable by all users

00:27:36.900 --> 00:27:40.420
and we don't get caught out
at the end of a project thinking,

00:27:40.540 --> 00:27:43.900
"Oh, my word, we've now got another
50 hours of development

00:27:44.020 --> 00:27:47.020
in front of us because
this wasn't test as we go."

00:27:47.140 --> 00:27:48.900
From start to finish, please.

00:27:52.940 --> 00:27:54.380
We produce the site.

00:27:55.180 --> 00:27:57.980
We can make
all of that very accessible

00:27:58.180 --> 00:28:01.620
but, of course,
it's so important to educate

00:28:01.780 --> 00:28:05.780
and assist our clients
on producing accessible content.

00:28:05.900 --> 00:28:08.940
We want to empower
our clients to do this.

00:28:09.060 --> 00:28:12.060
It's crucial to equip them
with the right knowledge

00:28:12.180 --> 00:28:14.740
to maintain the accessibility we've built

00:28:14.940 --> 00:28:17.860
into the bespoke WordPress theme
we've created.

00:28:18.020 --> 00:28:21.700
Let's explore
a few key principles and actions

00:28:21.860 --> 00:28:24.340
that can guide us
on achieving this goal.

00:28:24.580 --> 00:28:28.020
Again, I'm going to keep
on hammering this point home,

00:28:28.180 --> 00:28:30.140
let's talk about semantic structure.

00:28:30.300 --> 00:28:33.260
Using a proper heading hierarchy

00:28:33.460 --> 00:28:37.740
such as H1, H2, H3
is essential for improving navigation,

00:28:37.900 --> 00:28:39.740
especially for screen readers.

00:28:39.860 --> 00:28:43.420
Dare I say, a little nod
to SEO along the way.

00:28:43.540 --> 00:28:46.540
This ensures that content
is well organized,

00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:51.220
it's logical and it's easily
accessible to all users.

00:28:51.700 --> 00:28:54.780
Honestly, this is probably
the most common failure

00:28:54.900 --> 00:28:57.620
or misunderstanding by content creators.

00:28:58.140 --> 00:29:02.060
Developing functionality
to support alternative heading styling

00:29:02.260 --> 00:29:06.260
is as simple as adding
an additional CSS class

00:29:06.420 --> 00:29:11.340
to your heading and adding
in that class into your CSS, of course.

00:29:11.820 --> 00:29:14.660
I've mentioned, please, please, again,

00:29:14.820 --> 00:29:18.380
don't use heading tags purely
for styling purposes.

00:29:18.820 --> 00:29:22.900
I've mentioned
how you can effectively

00:29:23.060 --> 00:29:27.740
add a CSS class
to a heading to make H2 look like H4.

00:29:27.860 --> 00:29:31.420
Depending on your development skills
and experience,

00:29:31.540 --> 00:29:34.540
you can certainly extend
the block editor to support that.

00:29:35.100 --> 00:29:37.940
Let's consider contrast next.

00:29:38.380 --> 00:29:42.900
It's really important not to rely solely
on color to convey information,

00:29:43.060 --> 00:29:46.220
particularly in situations,
for instance,

00:29:46.300 --> 00:29:48.620
where you might be using an image background,

00:29:48.740 --> 00:29:53.700
which, by the way, should have
a CSS color behind them to--

00:29:53.860 --> 00:29:59.540
White text on a white background
when the images are disabled

00:29:59.780 --> 00:30:03.460
or doesn't load
is not effective for any user,

00:30:03.660 --> 00:30:05.860
regardless of the challenges faced by them.

00:30:06.100 --> 00:30:09.140
Ensuring sufficient contrast helps users

00:30:09.260 --> 00:30:12.460
with visual impairments
access content effectively.

00:30:13.020 --> 00:30:16.060
Understanding your audience
is also key.

00:30:16.580 --> 00:30:21.140
Aim for clear,
concise written language that resonates

00:30:21.260 --> 00:30:23.780
with the audience's needs
and preferences.

00:30:24.580 --> 00:30:29.700
Great accessibility
is not just about UI or your code.

00:30:29.940 --> 00:30:33.100
Those are just vessels for your content.

00:30:34.060 --> 00:30:37.380
I might suggest tools
like Hemingway Editor

00:30:37.580 --> 00:30:42.940
can actually help you author content
that's more readable,

00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:47.220
providing feedback
on sentence structure and complexity.

00:30:48.180 --> 00:30:50.260
Let's think about actions here.

00:30:50.380 --> 00:30:51.900
Focus on clear intent.

00:30:52.100 --> 00:30:55.820
Use descriptive text
instead of generic phrases

00:30:55.980 --> 00:30:57.780
like click here wherever possible.

00:30:57.940 --> 00:31:00.820
Be very clear
on the purpose of that link.

00:31:01.580 --> 00:31:04.660
This provides context
and improves accessibility

00:31:04.820 --> 00:31:06.860
for users relying on screen readers.

00:31:07.020 --> 00:31:10.660
Click here means nothing to anybody.

00:31:11.300 --> 00:31:13.380
For embedded media and downloads,

00:31:13.500 --> 00:31:18.860
provide captions and transcripts
for videos and ensure PDFs are accessible.

00:31:19.420 --> 00:31:23.540
This ensures that all users
can access multimedia content

00:31:23.700 --> 00:31:25.820
regardless of their abilities.

00:31:26.020 --> 00:31:29.740
Finally, the obvious one, and again,

00:31:29.900 --> 00:31:33.460
probably top of the list
or second on the list of mistakes

00:31:33.620 --> 00:31:37.540
that content creators make,
always create well written,

00:31:37.660 --> 00:31:40.220
descriptive alt tags for images.

00:31:40.980 --> 00:31:43.460
It needs a little guidance and training,

00:31:43.820 --> 00:31:46.020
but please, please remember this,

00:31:46.180 --> 00:31:49.300
it's so quick and easy to do
in the WordPress Media Library.

00:31:49.780 --> 00:31:54.380
This enhances accessibility
by providing context for visually impaired users.

00:31:55.540 --> 00:31:57.500
By following these best practices,

00:31:57.700 --> 00:32:00.780
we can empower our clients
to create accessible content

00:32:00.980 --> 00:32:03.980
that fosters
an inclusive digital environment.

00:32:05.580 --> 00:32:07.780
Let's talk through some tools now.

00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:09.500
There's a few things here.

00:32:09.620 --> 00:32:13.620
Now, when it comes
to accessibility, focus, development,

00:32:13.780 --> 00:32:17.300
and testing,
we use a variety of tools

00:32:17.460 --> 00:32:20.500
to ensure that everything
we produce is accessible

00:32:20.660 --> 00:32:23.060
and useful by all users.

00:32:23.660 --> 00:32:26.820
We do discover new tools
and switch around,

00:32:27.020 --> 00:32:29.700
but remember
the communication aspect

00:32:29.900 --> 00:32:34.260
by ensuring that all of our team members
are aware of changes,

00:32:34.420 --> 00:32:39.460
of new tools, of new techniques,
of better ways of working.

00:32:39.700 --> 00:32:45.780
We can share that knowledge
and ultimately create a repeatable,

00:32:45.940 --> 00:32:49.660
consistent process and results.

00:32:50.380 --> 00:32:54.860
We even have a dedicated accessibility channel
in our company Slack,

00:32:55.060 --> 00:32:58.420
providing a one stop location for updates

00:32:58.580 --> 00:33:01.100
and discussions
for the whole team.

00:33:01.540 --> 00:33:05.020
This stops information
getting siloed in your team.

00:33:05.140 --> 00:33:08.820
Share your expertise,
foster that culture.

00:33:08.940 --> 00:33:14.420
It will do nothing but good to accelerate
your accessibility efforts and frankly,

00:33:14.580 --> 00:33:19.220
save you time and budget
and queries when testing

00:33:19.380 --> 00:33:20.580
doesn't quite match up.

00:33:21.260 --> 00:33:23.540
I'm going to run through a few things here.

00:33:23.700 --> 00:33:26.700
I'm going to describe the reasoning

00:33:26.860 --> 00:33:28.980
behind some of these tools
and why they're useful.

00:33:29.180 --> 00:33:31.060
By the way, all of these are free.

00:33:31.900 --> 00:33:34.980
The top one there,
the readability testing.

00:33:35.100 --> 00:33:38.380
There are plenty of websites
out there that do this

00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:42.300
and there's probably some
rather clever AI stuff that can do this now.

00:33:42.460 --> 00:33:48.660
Just for quick checks on readability,
how easy is your text to understand?

00:33:49.100 --> 00:33:56.660
We sometimes use WebFX's
readability testing tool to assess just this.

00:33:57.420 --> 00:34:00.620
This tool provides a score
based on various algorithms,

00:34:00.860 --> 00:34:03.900
including ones
that I struggle to pronounce.

00:34:04.060 --> 00:34:07.660
We record the score
and calculate the average,

00:34:07.860 --> 00:34:11.300
highlighting any unusually
low scores or high scores,

00:34:11.460 --> 00:34:17.340
providing precise guidance
for improvement.

00:34:17.540 --> 00:34:19.420
It's a really nice quick check.

00:34:19.540 --> 00:34:22.180
Just copy and paste
the text of the page into it.

00:34:22.380 --> 00:34:24.140
You'll soon get a nice report back.

00:34:25.380 --> 00:34:28.060
I've mentioned
about automated testing

00:34:28.180 --> 00:34:32.900
and currently we're using three tools,
believe it or not.

00:34:33.900 --> 00:34:39.060
We use a range of tools,
including SiteImprove, Wave,

00:34:39.300 --> 00:34:41.980
and Microsoft Accessibility Insights.

00:34:43.340 --> 00:34:46.860
These tools help us identify
potential accessibility issues.

00:34:47.020 --> 00:34:51.580
These are automated testing tools
such as missing out text,

00:34:51.740 --> 00:34:55.020
incorrect heading levels,
insufficient color contrast.

00:34:55.820 --> 00:34:58.500
I would like to just flag up
the Microsoft one.

00:34:58.620 --> 00:35:01.460
It's surprisingly powerful
and has a couple

00:35:01.580 --> 00:35:05.780
of very useful features
like landmark identification.

00:35:05.940 --> 00:35:08.780
This is one I'm personally keeping an eye on

00:35:08.900 --> 00:35:10.260
and it's relatively new to us.

00:35:10.380 --> 00:35:13.020
We've probably brought that
on board in the last six-ish months.

00:35:13.500 --> 00:35:14.380
I like it.

00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:15.220
It's good.

00:35:16.380 --> 00:35:18.220
Web Developer Toolbar.

00:35:18.340 --> 00:35:19.220
Oh, my word.

00:35:19.380 --> 00:35:20.100
Oh, my word.

00:35:20.380 --> 00:35:26.340
We use the near legendary
Web Developer Toolbar to perform all sorts of tasks,

00:35:26.620 --> 00:35:30.620
including checking out tags,
disabling images,

00:35:30.820 --> 00:35:33.940
validating HTML straight from the browser.

00:35:34.140 --> 00:35:35.100
It's quite nice.

00:35:35.220 --> 00:35:37.300
You can validate local HTML

00:35:37.420 --> 00:35:40.260
so if you are developing locally
as you as you should.

00:35:40.700 --> 00:35:44.340
You've got your web server
installed on your laptop.

00:35:44.500 --> 00:35:48.700
You are creating code and you are seeing it
on your computer or laptop.

00:35:49.500 --> 00:35:53.820
It's a one click
to actually validate local HTML.

00:35:53.940 --> 00:35:55.460
You don't have to copy and paste things.

00:35:55.620 --> 00:35:56.740
It's very useful.

00:35:57.700 --> 00:36:02.420
There's just so much
in the Web Developer.

00:36:02.580 --> 00:36:04.660
I think it's just called a Web Developer now,

00:36:04.740 --> 00:36:07.020
whereas it used to be called
Web Developer Toolbar.

00:36:07.540 --> 00:36:11.220
Document outline checking,
semantic ordering,

00:36:11.420 --> 00:36:17.100
tab indexes,
unlabeled form fields.

00:36:17.260 --> 00:36:19.020
Literally, the list goes on.

00:36:19.260 --> 00:36:24.300
This is the proper Swiss army knife
for millions

00:36:24.540 --> 00:36:26.580
of different things in one extension.

00:36:27.580 --> 00:36:30.260
I just want to be really clear,

00:36:30.420 --> 00:36:32.700
if there's one extension
that everyone should install,

00:36:32.860 --> 00:36:34.700
genuinely, it's that one.

00:36:34.860 --> 00:36:37.500
It's available for a number
of different browsers.

00:36:38.100 --> 00:36:41.460
Contrast quick checks.

00:36:41.580 --> 00:36:44.580
Obviously,
I've mentioned automated tools here,

00:36:44.740 --> 00:36:47.660
but we use this one here.

00:36:47.860 --> 00:36:51.900
That is very clearly
called Colour Contrast Checker.

00:36:51.980 --> 00:36:55.340
They have a website
that's very attractive.

00:36:55.500 --> 00:37:00.780
They have a browser extension
that you can use as well.

00:37:00.940 --> 00:37:03.500
This allows us
to just quickly do

00:37:03.620 --> 00:37:06.060
on the spot assessments
of color contrast

00:37:06.220 --> 00:37:08.700
of our designs
or websites or anything.

00:37:08.820 --> 00:37:11.460
Has a nice little eye dropper
where you can sample colors.

00:37:11.660 --> 00:37:14.060
It's actually very, very nice.

00:37:14.220 --> 00:37:16.140
This tool helps ensure

00:37:16.260 --> 00:37:20.620
that our designs meet the minimum color
contrast requirements for accessibility.

00:37:20.820 --> 00:37:23.020
As I say, I think it looks great.

00:37:23.180 --> 00:37:25.940
It also has a nice trick up its sleeve,

00:37:26.100 --> 00:37:29.700
which enables you
to visualize color contrast

00:37:29.860 --> 00:37:33.260
and how things are going to look
with different Google fonts, too.

00:37:33.460 --> 00:37:37.220
As I mentioned,
has a very nice Chrome extension.

00:37:38.380 --> 00:37:40.180
Some of the more eagle eyes

00:37:40.340 --> 00:37:43.700
amongst you might
have noticed that Google Lighthouses

00:37:43.860 --> 00:37:45.660
is actually not on there.

00:37:45.820 --> 00:37:48.780
This is an interesting tool.

00:37:48.940 --> 00:37:49.900
Yes, sure.

00:37:50.020 --> 00:37:52.500
Sometimes we fire it up
and use it for different things.

00:37:53.300 --> 00:38:00.420
We've had some inconsistencies
in what has been reported,

00:38:00.620 --> 00:38:03.460
and that is why
we use more than one tool.

00:38:03.980 --> 00:38:08.020
We've had some false contrast checks

00:38:08.180 --> 00:38:11.620
that have actually been picked up
by our developers.

00:38:11.740 --> 00:38:15.180
That's not quite right
and then done a manual check.

00:38:15.380 --> 00:38:19.260
Whilst we do use this for some things,

00:38:19.380 --> 00:38:23.540
we don't really use it
for accessibility testing so much

00:38:23.740 --> 00:38:26.420
as we did maybe 12,
18 months ago.

00:38:28.220 --> 00:38:29.860
When using these tools,

00:38:30.300 --> 00:38:33.260
it's essential to remember
that automated testing

00:38:33.380 --> 00:38:39.060
is not a replacement
for expertise and manual testing.

00:38:40.140 --> 00:38:42.780
We need to visually
and technically assess

00:38:43.380 --> 00:38:46.900
and use our judgment to identify any issues

00:38:47.020 --> 00:38:49.940
that may not be caught
by automated tools.

00:38:50.740 --> 00:38:52.420
Just one tip here.

00:38:52.940 --> 00:38:55.180
When using automated testing tools,

00:38:55.380 --> 00:39:00.460
be mindful of false positives
and negatives or even miss things.

00:39:00.660 --> 00:39:04.820
Don't take the output
of any automated testing tool as gospel.

00:39:05.660 --> 00:39:08.700
That's why I say we use
a couple of different ones,

00:39:08.780 --> 00:39:12.820
maybe three at times,
and we use our own expertise

00:39:13.020 --> 00:39:17.140
and manual interpretation
to validate those results.

00:39:20.900 --> 00:39:23.540
As we've explored
throughout this presentation,

00:39:23.660 --> 00:39:27.540
accessibility
is not just a moral imperative,

00:39:27.900 --> 00:39:33.500
but a critical component of creating inclusive
and usable digital products.

00:39:34.420 --> 00:39:38.060
We've seen how integrating
accessibility into every stage

00:39:38.220 --> 00:39:41.020
of the development process
and sales process,

00:39:41.140 --> 00:39:44.100
even before that,
from design to testing,

00:39:44.260 --> 00:39:48.180
can ensure that our digital products
are accessible to all users,

00:39:48.380 --> 00:39:53.180
regardless of their abilities,
whilst maintaining commercial viability.

00:39:53.940 --> 00:39:58.380
We've also addressed the common concern
that accessibility costs more.

00:39:59.620 --> 00:40:00.860
As we've demonstrated here,

00:40:01.300 --> 00:40:04.340
considering accessibility
from start to finish

00:40:04.460 --> 00:40:10.180
can actually save costs in the long run
by avoiding costly retrofits

00:40:10.300 --> 00:40:13.620
or a big push at the end
when you suddenly realize,

00:40:13.780 --> 00:40:15.420
"Oh, I've left it to the last minute."

00:40:15.620 --> 00:40:16.700
Please don't do that.

00:40:16.940 --> 00:40:19.500
We want to ensure
that our digital products

00:40:19.620 --> 00:40:22.700
are usable
by the widest audience we can.

00:40:23.740 --> 00:40:26.940
With a skilled team, high accessibility

00:40:27.060 --> 00:40:30.220
can be partnered
with creative, innovative design.

00:40:30.740 --> 00:40:32.380
I can assure you of that.

00:40:32.540 --> 00:40:36.100
We've seen how semantic structure,
color contrast,

00:40:36.220 --> 00:40:41.940
and clean content can enhance
the user experience for all users,

00:40:42.340 --> 00:40:45.180
whilst also ensuring
that our digital products

00:40:45.300 --> 00:40:49.660
are accessible to those users
that have disabilities.

00:40:51.300 --> 00:40:54.460
As I start to wind up this presentation now,

00:40:54.620 --> 00:40:57.140
I want to leave you
with a key takeaway.

00:40:57.980 --> 00:41:05.220
Accessibility is not a trade off
between creativity and inclusivity.

00:41:05.740 --> 00:41:11.340
Rather, it's a fundamental aspect
of creating digital products

00:41:11.500 --> 00:41:17.860
that are usable, accessible,
and inclusive for all users.

00:41:18.740 --> 00:41:22.940
By prioritizing accessibility
and incorporating it

00:41:23.060 --> 00:41:27.140
into every stage of our development process
from start to finish,

00:41:27.620 --> 00:41:30.140
we can create products and websites

00:41:30.300 --> 00:41:32.900
that are not only compliant
with regulations,

00:41:33.340 --> 00:41:39.620
but ultimately, as I said,
provide a better user experience for all users.

00:41:39.740 --> 00:41:44.580
Let's make accessibility
a core part of our design

00:41:44.740 --> 00:41:46.020
and development process

00:41:46.180 --> 00:41:50.340
and create a more inclusive
digital landscape for everyone.

00:41:51.660 --> 00:41:53.180
Thank you for joining me today.

00:41:53.300 --> 00:41:55.140
I hope you found that insightful.

00:41:55.540 --> 00:41:58.940
I'd now like to welcome
any questions you may have, please.

00:42:03.820 --> 00:42:06.100
-Thank you so much, Jonny.

00:42:06.380 --> 00:42:09.380
That was an amazing,
amazing presentation.

00:42:09.580 --> 00:42:11.020
You're a natural.

00:42:11.220 --> 00:42:12.420
That's what it is.

00:42:12.580 --> 00:42:13.420
That's what I'll say.

00:42:13.540 --> 00:42:14.140
Jonny Allbut: Very kind.

00:42:14.220 --> 00:42:14.940
[laughter]

00:42:15.100 --> 00:42:16.940
Not my first rodeo, to be fair.

00:42:17.940 --> 00:42:20.820
-Thank you, Jonny,

00:42:20.940 --> 00:42:22.540
again for your wonderful presentation

00:42:22.620 --> 00:42:26.020
on inclusive design strategies
for WordPress professionals.

00:42:26.180 --> 00:42:29.020
At this point,
I'd like to ask our audience

00:42:29.180 --> 00:42:32.980
to enter their questions
in the question and answer section.

00:42:33.700 --> 00:42:37.780
Please ask questions
and you can be rest assured

00:42:37.900 --> 00:42:41.460
that Jonny will be there to answer
as many questions as the time permits.

00:42:41.620 --> 00:42:45.180
-I can actually see a couple in the Q&amp;A.

00:42:45.340 --> 00:42:47.700
Am I okay to just dig into those?

00:42:47.860 --> 00:42:49.260
Yigakpoa Samuel Ikpae: Yes.

00:42:49.380 --> 00:42:51.580
Let me ask that one.

00:42:51.700 --> 00:42:54.540
In building your team
at Illustrate Digital,

00:42:54.700 --> 00:42:57.540
did you recruit for accessibility awareness

00:42:57.660 --> 00:43:02.300
or for design skills
and then add accessibility to your tool belt?

00:43:03.220 --> 00:43:07.220
Jonny Allbut: That's actually
a really interesting question

00:43:07.300 --> 00:43:09.540
because I'm recruiting
for my department right now.

00:43:09.700 --> 00:43:11.380
I won't say any more about that, but hey.

00:43:11.540 --> 00:43:20.780
I think to be a professional
in this industry these days--

00:43:23.060 --> 00:43:26.220
I can see that's all for design skills

00:43:26.340 --> 00:43:30.500
so I'm thinking
that's probably UX-UI department, my baby.

00:43:32.060 --> 00:43:40.180
Frankly, I use it as a little bit
of a sense of character,

00:43:40.340 --> 00:43:45.220
a sense of professionalism,
a sense of care for the user.

00:43:45.380 --> 00:43:49.300
I would be slightly alarmed
if I'm honest with you,

00:43:49.420 --> 00:43:51.620
if I was recruiting
for the UX department,

00:43:51.780 --> 00:43:56.940
if they weren't interested
in accessibility

00:43:57.100 --> 00:44:02.060
because great user experience
relies on accessibility.

00:44:02.180 --> 00:44:07.100
As I mentioned, actually,
achieving great accessibility

00:44:07.260 --> 00:44:11.740
can actually provide an amazing,
improved user experience

00:44:11.940 --> 00:44:14.620
for all the users of the website.

00:44:15.180 --> 00:44:18.340
Just following those best practices
is good acumen.

00:44:18.460 --> 00:44:20.820
To accurately answer that question,

00:44:21.060 --> 00:44:26.500
I would be alarmed
if someone in UX these days

00:44:26.620 --> 00:44:31.980
didn't care about accessibility
or had at least working knowledge.

00:44:32.180 --> 00:44:37.460
If they were an amazing creative
and showed interest,

00:44:37.660 --> 00:44:41.020
but not demonstrated expertise
and knowledge,

00:44:41.180 --> 00:44:44.940
we would be more than happy
to bring them in and train them.

00:44:46.820 --> 00:44:48.500
I expect to see awareness.

00:44:48.980 --> 00:44:54.020
I don't necessarily expect
to see knowledge

00:44:54.140 --> 00:44:57.980
and expertise up to the level
that we carry in-house.

00:44:58.140 --> 00:45:00.420
That's something
I would foster and mentor.

00:45:00.500 --> 00:45:02.260
I hope that answers that question.

00:45:04.580 --> 00:45:05.420
-Thank you so much.

00:45:05.620 --> 00:45:06.940
That was very great insight.

00:45:07.140 --> 00:45:09.180
I do think it answers the question.

00:45:09.300 --> 00:45:14.420
We have another question
and I'd like to read it out to you,

00:45:14.580 --> 00:45:15.300
if that's okay.

00:45:17.700 --> 00:45:21.900
-I can see the question from Philip Bremer there.

00:45:22.060 --> 00:45:26.060
As a developer, how much knowledge
should I have in accessible design?

00:45:26.260 --> 00:45:29.620
An agency asked me
to offer them an accessible website.

00:45:30.100 --> 00:45:33.620
They will deliver the design,
but have no experience in it.

00:45:33.780 --> 00:45:37.820
I asked to work with someone
who at least made an online course,

00:45:37.980 --> 00:45:40.180
but I don't think this is going to happen.

00:45:40.340 --> 00:45:43.460
Should I take the responsibility
in the design too?

00:45:43.620 --> 00:45:46.300
That's a really, really interesting question.

00:45:46.540 --> 00:45:49.540
I've actually spent most of my career

00:45:49.620 --> 00:45:52.700
before joining Illustrate Digital
as a freelancer

00:45:52.900 --> 00:45:55.100
so I've been down this avenue.

00:45:55.260 --> 00:46:03.060
With this one,
it really depends on your client

00:46:03.220 --> 00:46:05.660
or the agency you're working with, Philip.

00:46:05.820 --> 00:46:13.940
For me, I would offer to collaborate

00:46:14.100 --> 00:46:19.060
with their in-house design team
right from the start.

00:46:19.300 --> 00:46:24.980
You may also offer them the choice
of collaboration and consultation.

00:46:25.460 --> 00:46:26.860
It's up to you how you build that.

00:46:26.980 --> 00:46:28.500
Of course, I'm not going to get into that.

00:46:28.620 --> 00:46:32.940
Collaboration and fostering that
but getting from the start,

00:46:33.140 --> 00:46:37.580
please, Philip, don't get the designs
and have to then tear it apart.

00:46:38.420 --> 00:46:44.020
Offer the consultation
or because otherwise you will likely end up

00:46:44.140 --> 00:46:48.340
with a UI style kit
that is not accessible,

00:46:48.540 --> 00:46:53.820
and then face
a long road on refining that.

00:46:53.980 --> 00:46:55.460
Getting from the start or,

00:46:55.580 --> 00:46:58.700
as you said, "Should I take
the responsibility in the design too?"

00:46:59.300 --> 00:47:02.500
Again, I'm not going to talk about billing
and commercials around that.

00:47:02.740 --> 00:47:06.140
That is certainly an option
but personally,

00:47:06.300 --> 00:47:07.900
my preferred first avenue,

00:47:08.020 --> 00:47:11.740
especially if this is an agency
that you work with regularly,

00:47:11.860 --> 00:47:17.540
is to help foster them,
share knowledge,

00:47:17.700 --> 00:47:23.540
help develop their understanding
of accessibility in UI design

00:47:23.700 --> 00:47:28.300
and UX to help you achieve
what they're asking for.

00:47:28.500 --> 00:47:30.220
Just one final point there.

00:47:30.340 --> 00:47:34.260
I would personally
be reinforcing very strong caveats

00:47:34.420 --> 00:47:39.100
of you're producing the design.

00:47:39.300 --> 00:47:42.460
I cannot guarantee it is going

00:47:42.540 --> 00:47:46.820
to be an accessible build
without my consultation.

00:47:46.980 --> 00:47:51.340
Just caveats
and protect yourself, Philip,

00:47:51.460 --> 00:47:57.900
and help them understand that accessibility
isn't just contrast and the basics.

00:47:58.060 --> 00:47:59.860
I hope that answers the question there.

00:48:02.060 --> 00:48:03.580
-Thank you so much, Johnny.

00:48:03.700 --> 00:48:06.580
We do have another question and it says,

00:48:06.740 --> 00:48:10.740
"Do you do user testing
with people with specific disabilities

00:48:10.860 --> 00:48:13.100
as well as your internal testing?

00:48:13.260 --> 00:48:18.260
If so, do you have any recommendations
for finding suitable external testers?"

00:48:18.420 --> 00:48:24.620
-Oh, okay,
that's an interesting one, anonymous attendee.

00:48:27.060 --> 00:48:31.460
Right now,
I'll be straight up and honest with you.

00:48:31.660 --> 00:48:39.380
We do do user interviews,
user testing as part of UX research process.

00:48:41.580 --> 00:48:45.100
We have not had
a requirement as such,

00:48:45.300 --> 00:48:48.660
certainly in recent times
for testing with people

00:48:48.780 --> 00:48:54.940
with specific disabilities but it says,

00:48:55.020 --> 00:48:57.260
if so, do you have
any recommendations

00:48:57.380 --> 00:48:59.500
for finding suitable external testers?

00:48:59.660 --> 00:49:03.580
I can share a couple
of insights around that part at least.

00:49:04.020 --> 00:49:14.260
Recruiting for user testing can be costly,
complicated, very time consuming.

00:49:14.420 --> 00:49:17.820
The more narrower you get
on the demographic

00:49:17.940 --> 00:49:20.500
of the type of person
that you want to participate,

00:49:20.660 --> 00:49:24.580
the narrower it gets,
the harder it gets.

00:49:27.540 --> 00:49:32.740
There are various websites
that help you recruit users,

00:49:32.900 --> 00:49:37.340
user interviews,
user testing.com.

00:49:37.540 --> 00:49:40.020
All these have a price tag to them.

00:49:40.180 --> 00:49:44.980
They have a pool of users and you can set up
screener questions and things like that.

00:49:46.180 --> 00:49:50.540
As I say, the narrower you get
on the criteria for recruitment,

00:49:50.660 --> 00:49:51.820
the harder it gets.

00:49:52.020 --> 00:49:55.300
Frankly, you may actually
need to go down

00:49:55.380 --> 00:49:59.260
a more specialized bespoke recruitment route

00:49:59.460 --> 00:50:03.660
to find suitable testers
with disabilities.

00:50:03.820 --> 00:50:11.980
Also, don't discount going
into communities, forums,

00:50:12.100 --> 00:50:13.860
LinkedIn groups, support groups,

00:50:14.020 --> 00:50:16.540
things like that
and asking the honest question.

00:50:16.700 --> 00:50:19.540
What I will leave you
with is a final nugget.

00:50:19.700 --> 00:50:24.900
If you want people to participate
and engage with user testing,

00:50:25.460 --> 00:50:27.460
please don't expect it for free.

00:50:28.020 --> 00:50:31.020
Any user testers should be rewarded.

00:50:31.180 --> 00:50:35.540
You will find if you try to hop-skip that
and not reward them,

00:50:37.140 --> 00:50:38.140
people won't turn up.

00:50:38.300 --> 00:50:39.940
They won't be engaged.

00:50:40.100 --> 00:50:42.260
Hell, they probably won't even apply.

00:50:42.420 --> 00:50:46.140
As a rough guide,
you're probably looking

00:50:46.300 --> 00:50:50.220
at the user testing session
shouldn't be more than half an hour.

00:50:50.420 --> 00:50:51.860
They should be half an hour or less.

00:50:52.020 --> 00:50:55.300
You're probably looking
at a rough range

00:50:55.460 --> 00:51:00.300
depending on the type of person
and lots of different factors of around--

00:51:01.180 --> 00:51:03.460
I'll use US dollars,
a minimum,

00:51:03.580 --> 00:51:08.380
really, of about $50, $60
for a 30-minute session.

00:51:08.580 --> 00:51:10.580
$50, $60-ish.

00:51:10.780 --> 00:51:14.820
As I said, moderated user testing

00:51:14.940 --> 00:51:17.580
when you're on a call like this
and sharing screens,

00:51:17.740 --> 00:51:21.460
it's not cheap
and please don't expect users to do it for free.

00:51:21.660 --> 00:51:24.220
I hope that answers
the question the best I can anyway.

00:51:25.820 --> 00:51:27.660
-Yes, it did.

00:51:27.820 --> 00:51:29.340
Thank you so much again, Jonny.

00:51:29.500 --> 00:51:35.060
I'd just like to tell everyone
that this was an amazing session on my end.

00:51:35.220 --> 00:51:36.300
I did enjoy it.

00:51:36.540 --> 00:51:39.900
Thank you for attending
this session with Jonny Allbut.

00:51:40.100 --> 00:51:42.460
