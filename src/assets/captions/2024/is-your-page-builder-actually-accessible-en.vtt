00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:01.620
<v Announcer> --Page
Builder Actually Accessible,

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.980
with speaker Scarlett Isbell,
web developer at Orbit Media Studios.

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.620
This presentation
was recorded October 2024.

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:15.740
<v Simon Miner> Welcome
to WordPress Accessibility Day 2024.

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:19.580
My name is Simon Miner,
and I'm the founder and CEO of Pedal Point Solutions.

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.220
If I'm looking away
from you right now,

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:23.700
it's not that I'm being rude.

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.220
I just have a low vision
and a big monitor with large text in front of me.

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:34.220
It's my pleasure to welcome you here
and thank you for joining us

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.500
for this session entitled,
Is Your Page Builder Actually Accessible,

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:39.940
with Scarlett Isbell.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.660
A little bit about Scarlett.

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.460
Scarlett has been developing
WordPress sites for over a decade now,

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:51.500
spending most
of that time working on page builders

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.540
and finding their strengths and weaknesses.

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:58.220
She is currently
a web developer for Orbit Media,

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:03.820
where she is an accessibility advocate
and the resident Elementor aficionado.

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:09.100
Every day, she collaborates
with others to learn, improve,

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:13.100
and explore new ways to make
the web and the whole world,

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.500
in fact, a more inclusive space.

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:22.020
From being the lead organizer
of WordCamp Fayetteville

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.980
to hosting WordPress meetups
for the Springfield, Missouri community,

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.380
Scarlett believes that everybody
should feel supported

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:36.900
and encouraged
on their journey to make the web better

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:38.700
and more accessible to everyone.

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.300
Just a note.

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.340
Please feel free to add
your questions in the Zoom Q&amp;A section,

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.980
and we'll answer them
at the end of the presentation,

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.020
and use the chat feature
to connect with other attendees.

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.340
With that,
I want to turn it over to Scarlett.

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:57.740
Please take it away.

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:59.180
<v Scarlett Isbell> Awesome.

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.420
Thank you so much, Simon,
for that glowing introduction here.

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:07.820
This is actually my first time
presenting at a conference,

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.300
and what a better way to kick it off
than WordPress Accessibility Day.

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.420
I am so excited to be here.

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.940
Thank you for everyone
who is attending.

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.780
Today I am going
to take you on the guided tour

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.060
through page builder accessibility.

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:30.780
I will be your tour guide for today.

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.460
With Simon's introduction,
I don't really need to tell you much more.

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.500
I have added the link to my LinkedIn.

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.140
Look me up, connect with me.

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:44.900
Along our guide today,
please keep your arms, legs, hands,

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:49.260
and personal belongings
within the Zoom call at all times.

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:51.340
Let's get rolling.

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:57.020
First off, we're going to start with,
why use a page builder?

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:02.460
Page builders
are really geared towards beginners,

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.340
and they're really easy
to use and an easy way

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.620
to add functionality to your website

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.500
without requiring
a lot of custom coding.

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.420
However,
this also comes with drawbacks

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:19.180
because a lot of them--
In fact, spoiler alert,

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.260
I haven't found
a page builder that is fully accessible.

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.500
I don't believe
that there is one out there.

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.180
I think it comes
with the nature of the beast

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:30.380
that we're going to learn to wrangle today.

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:36.020
Knowing those tools,
they can be helpful,

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:39.380
and we can choose
what choices to make.

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.580
That takes us into the next thing
we need to cover,

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:46.420
which is user responsibility.

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:52.220
Choosing to use a page builder comes
with a lot of responsibility on us,

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:59.620
the user, the people building these sites,
to choose the best widgets,

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:02.220
the best modules, the best things

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:06.460
to make our site
the most inclusive they can be.

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:10.100
Page builders include
a lot of features

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:11.780
and things that might look fun,

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:14.660
but there's an underlying surface there

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:17.980
that's just not accessible or easy to use.

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:23.020
Remember that just because
a feature is popular within a page builder,

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:27.900
or all page builders for that matter,
doesn't mean that it's inclusive.

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:32.300
Part of the user responsibility is also ensuring

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:37.300
that we are doing our proper testing,
so testing on screen readers,

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:44.700
assistive technology devices,
keyboards, doing manual testing.

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:49.700
I love tools
such as Wave and Siteimprove

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:55.220
to help get an overall view
of how our website accessibility is doing,

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:01.060
but ensuring that we're doing
our manual testing just can't be beat.

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.460
Because we're users.

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:05.900
We're not computers in this space.

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:11.700
The first section along
our journey today is going

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:14.660
to be our page builder success checklist.

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:19.740
Whether you have a page builder
that you've been using for a while,

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:22.740
or you're looking
to just get started with one,

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:25.700
these are the features
to keep an eye on

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:30.340
that can give a good indication
of whether your page builder

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:35.540
is even considering accessibility
in the way that they build things,

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:39.860
and some do this a little bit better than others.

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:46.100
There will be four items
in our checklist to get started,

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:48.260
and let's get going.

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:51.700
Our first one is a skip
to content link.

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:55.220
While this is a simple feature,

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:58.540
it is often overlooked
by page builders.

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:01.140
When it would be easy to add it in,

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:06.060
or at least add a toggle
to where you can turn it on or off,

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:08.180
please leave the toggle on.

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:12.020
It is, unfortunately, forgotten.

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:17.820
A skip to content link
allows a user to be able

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:21.420
to skip over your navigation
once they tab

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:23.060
into the body of the site,

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:26.500
and then that way they can get
to the main content.

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:31.380
As you can imagine,
if you had a big old navigation

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:35.460
that a user is trying
to navigate through your site

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:38.180
on a keyboard
or assistive technology,

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:42.540
they might get frustrated
and even leave

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:44.020
and not want to deal with it

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:47.620
if they can't get to the reason
why they're there.

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:51.420
If this is something
that your page builder is missing,

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:55.420
it can be easily added
using some custom code.

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:58.540
I've found that a quick Google search

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:04.340
will give a good amount of resources
for your specific page builder.

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:11.180
Here's an example of what a skip
to content link would look like.

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:16.220
Shout-out to the website
for our event today.

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:18.060
It may look familiar.

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:24.140
Again, whenever a user tabs
into the body of your site,

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:25.660
this is what they will see.

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:27.340
Along with that,

00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:34.180
just ensuring that this skip to content link
has a good target size on it

00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:35.500
so it's big enough to click,

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:42.380
and it has a good contrast ratio
so the user can easily tell what it says.

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:49.980
Moving on into our next checklist items
is our focus outlines.

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:56.220
Ensuring that items
on our site have proper outlines

00:07:56.380 --> 00:08:01.060
is very important for letting users
that may be on keyboards

00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:04.620
or assistive technologies
know where they're at on the site.

00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:10.820
It's, again, another simple feature that,
for some reason,

00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:12.500
page builders don't bake in.

00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:18.060
It is an easy enough one
to add using CSS.

00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:22.420
Let's take a look
at a better example

00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:25.300
of what a good focus outline
might look like.

00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:29.900
I have two images
on the screen here.

00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:34.060
On the top one,
we have three items within a navigation,

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:39.660
and the second item
is highlighted using a focus outline.

00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:45.340
The user can easily tell that
that's where they are on the site.

00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:48.300
They can easily see it.

00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:52.580
Then the bottom one;
if a user was navigating via keyboard

00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:56.060
or assistive technology,
they wouldn't know-

00:08:56.220 --> 00:09:00.660
they wouldn't be able to tell
that they were on the sponsors link

00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:03.220
or maybe anywhere on the page.

00:09:03.340 --> 00:09:07.420
They would be completely lost,
and this is not great.

00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:12.020
Along with that,
ensuring that your focus outlines

00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:14.660
are also of a good contrast.

00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:19.820
I know a lot of websites,
they have light and dark sections.

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:27.420
Ensuring that your focus outline
is always a high-contrast color

00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:29.540
is always the way to go.

00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:35.740
I love a good dual-color approach,
so ensuring an outline

00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:39.660
that has maybe both dark
and light colors so that way,

00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:42.420
regardless of the background, it's always visible.

00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:46.340
Then also making sure
that it's a good thickness.

00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:52.060
I believe that two pixels is
the recommended thickness for a focus outline.

00:09:54.260 --> 00:10:00.180
As we move along our journey here,
we move into a biggie;

00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:02.780
the proper landmark usage.

00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:08.820
Ensuring that different landmarks
are being properly identified upon our site.

00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:17.020
For example--
Excuse my rough Photoshop skills here.

00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:19.980
It's tougher to find an illustration
of this than you would believe.

00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:24.700
Here is the general,
very simplified version

00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:27.660
of the way the site landmark might look.

00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:33.700
You have your header landmark,
and nested inside that you have a nav landmark.

00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:37.340
Then below that we have our main, our footer,

00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:43.060
and another nav element nested
within our footer.

00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:50.940
Your page builder should allow you
to easily specify these things

00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:53.300
if they don't already have them specified.

00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:57.260
Otherwise,
this can be done using custom code,

00:10:57.460 --> 00:11:01.020
but it definitely makes it
a little bit tougher.

00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:06.660
These landmarks ensure that a user
can tell where they are at on a site.

00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:09.340
If you wouldn't be able to see the site,

00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:12.980
you're navigating via assistive technology,
a screen reader,

00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:15.980
it will read these elements aloud,

00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:20.700
and they can even jump to the elements
that they would like to know more about.

00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:29.500
For example, this,
I've taken a screenshot from Elementor.

00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:33.260
What we're seeing here
is Elementor is allowing us

00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:40.300
to adjust the HTML tag to indicate
what landmark we would like this to be.

00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:44.420
In this example,
we have the selected header,

00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:49.580
but it gives you the flexibility
to select whatever landmark

00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:53.860
is best for where you need it to be,

00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:56.820
and ensuring that those
are being used accurately.

00:11:57.500 --> 00:12:01.340
Another thing
that's essential is to ensure

00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:04.460
that these are used
consistently across your site,

00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:10.660
and if you are building websites
for a client or somebody else to use,

00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:18.620
that they are educated
on how to also use landmarks properly,

00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:22.140
or ensure that the website
is set up in such a way

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:26.540
that they don't really have
to worry about it too, too much.

00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:32.220
Another thing that's important
about these is ensuring

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:34.460
that everything is properly labeled.

00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:42.180
Going back to our example here
of the setup is within the header,

00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:44.500
we see we have one nav element.

00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:49.460
Let's say we had a nav element
for the primary navigation,

00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:53.460
but within the header we also had
a second one for a secondary navigation.

00:12:53.660 --> 00:12:58.420
Without it being properly labeled
with an ARIA label,

00:12:58.540 --> 00:13:01.540
that could get confusing for a user.

00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:08.220
That brings us
into our last and final checklist item,

00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:11.820
which is a custom
attribute support.

00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:18.700
Custom attributes,
within page builders and in general,

00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:23.660
allow you to be able
to add those different ARIA labels

00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:26.300
to these sections of your website.

00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:29.300
Whenever a user is going through,

00:13:29.420 --> 00:13:32.380
it will read out
that it's a primary navigation

00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:34.540
versus a secondary navigation,

00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:40.100
or it can help clarify phone numbers
that might get jumbled on screen readers.

00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:45.860
Anything to make it clearer
and help reduce frustration for a user,

00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:50.740
just make it an easier world
to navigate the web in.

00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:58.500
These attributes can also
be added using code, JavaScript,

00:13:58.620 --> 00:14:03.340
and stuff like that, if the page builder
doesn't make it easy for you.

00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:07.820
I know that there's a few out there
that are supporting custom attribute support.

00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:12.300
I believe Elementor, Divi,
and maybe Visual Composer.

00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:12.940
I don't know.

00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:14.980
That's not a complete list.

00:14:15.140 --> 00:14:18.620
Don't hold me to it,
but it kind of gives you a general guide.

00:14:20.180 --> 00:14:23.500
Here's a few ARIA attribute examples.

00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:25.420
Like I said, a few.

00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:28.940
There's many more,
but these are more of the common ones

00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:32.940
of the ARIA label: aria-role,
aria-live, and aria-hidden.

00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:36.740
One thing to watch out
for on page builders

00:14:36.860 --> 00:14:42.820
is I've found that a lot do love
that aria-hidden for some reason.

00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:47.220
That means that if aria-hidden
is added to an element,

00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:55.540
a user will not be able to read that item
with their assistive technology,

00:14:55.740 --> 00:14:58.820
therefore not even knowing that it's there.

00:14:58.980 --> 00:15:02.540
While this item is good
in strategic places,

00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:07.220
I've found it on things
in page builders such as social icons

00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:10.100
that seem pretty essential.

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:17.020
For some reason,
page builders just love those items.

00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:21.220
Here's an example
within the Elementor editor.

00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:26.420
We have a screenshot here
within the custom attributes section,

00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:30.300
and here I've written out the ARIA label,

00:15:30.460 --> 00:15:35.180
and then it has a pipe
where we add the primary nav label to it.

00:15:35.340 --> 00:15:39.700
Then it will add that ARIA label to that item

00:15:39.940 --> 00:15:44.020
to make it a little bit easier
for you without custom coding.

00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:50.020
I'm sure that the format of this looks
different across all page builders,

00:15:50.180 --> 00:15:54.380
so read the read the documentation
for your page builder

00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:57.500
and find out what is right for you.

00:15:59.220 --> 00:16:00.020
All right.

00:16:00.180 --> 00:16:07.180
We're on to the next section
in our tour today, and it's a big one.

00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:08.740
It's our red flag list.

00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:11.380
First, I'm going to take
a hydration break real quick.

00:16:11.540 --> 00:16:14.180
[silence]

00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:17.500
All right.

00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:21.700
Our red flag list are items
to keep in mind.

00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:24.780
These are accessibility pitfalls.

00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:28.420
Usually, these items
within page builders are not accessible,

00:16:28.620 --> 00:16:31.420
so we need to keep
a very close eye on them,

00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:34.900
and in some cases,
we'll avoid them completely.

00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:36.700
Don't worry, though.

00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:44.060
I'll offer some good, more accessible
alternatives to those items as well.

00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:52.660
Bringing us in strong, waving us in
with that red flag are interactive elements.

00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:57.980
These are items such as flip boxes,
interactive circles, flip carousels.

00:16:58.140 --> 00:17:00.980
I mean, honestly, anything that says flip

00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:03.980
or interactive within
a page builder, I just say-

00:17:04.100 --> 00:17:05.460
[chuckles] I usually nope out of.

00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:13.580
These kinds of items like
to take valuable content and hide them

00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:17.620
from the user or force them
to interact with it

00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:19.500
in order to be able to see it.

00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:24.340
This could be in the form
of a hover or a focus

00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:28.700
that the user has to perform
in order to see this content

00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:32.180
because it's hidden behind
a box or an element.

00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:39.060
These are definitely
an avoid completely in my list.

00:17:39.220 --> 00:17:44.020
They are excluding users,
and they're just plain bad.

00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:49.220
Here I have a screenshot here
demonstrating some examples.

00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:54.540
I wasn't going to subject you
to all that motion and craziness today,

00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:56.100
so screenshots it is.

00:17:57.220 --> 00:18:01.820
I've gotten this screenshot
from the Elementor website,

00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:03.820
and we see three cards.

00:18:03.980 --> 00:18:10.700
The first one, we can see
is flipping over from side to side.

00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:14.140
Then the second one
is currently being hovered,

00:18:14.220 --> 00:18:17.180
where we can see that some
of the content is being pushed up

00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:19.580
and new content is being displayed.

00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:24.940
Then the second one,
we just see that it has an icon with a title.

00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:28.220
Where to begin on these?

00:18:28.340 --> 00:18:35.780
For one, we have problematic animations
that whenever the user interacts with it,

00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:41.700
they get bombarded with an experience
that they likely didn't sign up for.

00:18:41.860 --> 00:18:50.060
Then we're also hiding
a valuable content underneath this.

00:18:50.180 --> 00:18:53.540
When a user is scanning
through the site,

00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:56.340
these cards aren't clearly clickable.

00:18:56.460 --> 00:19:00.660
There's no indicator
that the user needs to take an action.

00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:05.580
This content is being hidden
from so many users

00:19:05.740 --> 00:19:07.660
that they're not going to be able to see

00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:15.780
or get to know what you're trying
to promote for them, and it's frustrating.

00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:20.700
Not to mention users with motion sensitivity
and different things like that.

00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:28.140
My recommendation for items
like these is to just go with a static card.

00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:31.300
It is fine to put it all out on the table

00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:34.180
and show your users all of the content,

00:19:34.340 --> 00:19:37.780
so having that icon
at the top, the title.

00:19:37.940 --> 00:19:42.660
Then let's put just
the content underneath it so that way,

00:19:42.740 --> 00:19:43.660
the user can see it.

00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:48.260
If that card is meant to be clickable,
please add an indicator.

00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:55.380
We just keep on waving
with the animated items.

00:19:55.540 --> 00:20:00.220
This one has to be one
of my least favorites

00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:04.940
on my red flag list
is the animated titles.

00:20:05.420 --> 00:20:09.940
For some reason,
page builders love these,

00:20:10.020 --> 00:20:12.220
and I will never figure out the reason why.

00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:18.460
These animated titles are problematic
because they're always changing text.

00:20:18.580 --> 00:20:20.460
There's a constant animation.

00:20:20.660 --> 00:20:24.900
They don't allow the user
to pause or play the animations.

00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:27.540
It's just [mimics aversion].

00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:30.700
If you need a title or a headline,

00:20:30.820 --> 00:20:35.540
please just use a properly
marked up headline.

00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:37.340
That is perfectly okay.

00:20:39.140 --> 00:20:40.420
Here's an example.

00:20:40.540 --> 00:20:44.220
Again, I wasn't going
to subject you guys to all that movement

00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:49.300
and everything going on,
but here's a screenshot of an animated title.

00:20:49.460 --> 00:20:53.860
On the screen,
we see there's just some filler content

00:20:54.020 --> 00:20:56.180
that's flowing off
of the page.

00:20:56.340 --> 00:20:59.660
As I was sitting on the page,
a new word popped in

00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:03.060
and then it went out again
and then another word popped in.

00:21:03.180 --> 00:21:04.820
Confusing.

00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:09.260
You don't know what message
they're trying to get across to you

00:21:09.380 --> 00:21:12.620
because the content is always changing.

00:21:12.780 --> 00:21:18.540
It's bad for users
with motion sensitivity.

00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:23.420
It's tough for anyone
to really keep up with.

00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:25.020
Let's avoid these.

00:21:25.140 --> 00:21:29.220
Let's put these on the page builder
no-no list if we could.

00:21:31.540 --> 00:21:36.260
The animations
just keep on going with these red flags.

00:21:36.380 --> 00:21:41.780
Another popular thing
that we see on page builders a lot

00:21:41.900 --> 00:21:47.780
is that they'll give you the option
for extra effects and animations,

00:21:47.900 --> 00:21:53.300
such entrance animations and scrolling
animations and different things like that.

00:21:53.460 --> 00:22:00.300
While these aren't always the worst,
they're not the best either.

00:22:00.460 --> 00:22:04.820
They can be used
within a certain realm.

00:22:04.980 --> 00:22:08.820
One thing to note
that I've recently found out

00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:14.500
was that a lot of page builders;
there's a setting within users' browsers

00:22:14.660 --> 00:22:16.460
that they can reduce motion,

00:22:16.620 --> 00:22:21.780
and it's supposed to turn off
the entrance animations and different things.

00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:25.460
There's page builders out there
that are ignoring this,

00:22:25.580 --> 00:22:28.740
which- I mean,
can we say problematic?

00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:34.780
There is some custom code
that you might be able

00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:37.460
to add in there to ensure
that your page builder

00:22:37.580 --> 00:22:40.020
is listening to your users.

00:22:40.100 --> 00:22:44.940
Just ensure you're doing your testing
and everything is looking good.

00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:48.300
This is one of those proceed
with great caution

00:22:48.460 --> 00:22:51.900
and ensure
that everything works properly.

00:22:52.060 --> 00:22:57.740
Here's an example that I found
on the Elementor website.

00:22:57.860 --> 00:23:00.540
I guess a big call-out here,
don't come for me,

00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:05.780
but they're using
a scrolling effect to have--

00:23:05.900 --> 00:23:09.860
and they have all these
little cards on top of this headline.

00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:16.660
Then as you scroll, the cards dissipate
and you can then read the headline.

00:23:16.820 --> 00:23:21.100
One, why are we covering up
the headline in the first place?

00:23:21.220 --> 00:23:26.540
We're making this a little too difficult
for users to read and interact with.

00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:28.740
There's all these cards.

00:23:28.860 --> 00:23:30.660
Are they clickable?

00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:32.540
Am I supposed to do something with it?

00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:33.300
I don't know.

00:23:33.420 --> 00:23:35.700
There's too much.

00:23:35.820 --> 00:23:39.140
It's items like these
that we just need--

00:23:39.260 --> 00:23:43.140
let's toss those out of our options.

00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:53.820
Then we're moving,
waving in with our sliders and our carousels.

00:23:53.940 --> 00:24:01.220
Again, we're forcing user interaction
to be able to view our content.

00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:04.660
Sliders,
unless they're marked up properly,

00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:08.100
don't always work
with assistive technology.

00:24:08.260 --> 00:24:11.780
Usually, within a page builder,
might be a shocker,

00:24:11.900 --> 00:24:14.940
but they're not always
marked up properly.

00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:20.260
These are one of the things
that I do recommend avoiding where you can,

00:24:20.380 --> 00:24:22.540
where it is possible.

00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:27.140
The W3C does give us an example

00:24:27.260 --> 00:24:30.500
of what a properly marked up
slider does look like,

00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:36.260
so you at least have that
to go on should you have any questions

00:24:36.380 --> 00:24:39.660
or should you really want
a slider for your website.

00:24:39.780 --> 00:24:41.420
There are ways to make it accessible,

00:24:41.540 --> 00:24:45.060
but I'm never a fan
for hiding content from users.

00:24:46.020 --> 00:24:53.500
Here's an example of a slider
that I saw on the Beaver Builder website.

00:24:53.620 --> 00:25:02.860
We see a screenshot of a slider
that has a kitty and a dog playing,

00:25:03.020 --> 00:25:07.180
with an overlay in the center
that has some text and a button.

00:25:07.340 --> 00:25:14.540
Would you believe me if I said
that there's also navigation arrows on this slider?

00:25:15.340 --> 00:25:17.260
No, really, there are.

00:25:17.420 --> 00:25:21.740
I just put circles around them on the screen.

00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:25.660
This is also why if you're going to use a slider,

00:25:25.780 --> 00:25:31.300
ensuring proper contrast is essential for users.

00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:35.660
Most users
would just come here, see this

00:25:35.740 --> 00:25:41.220
and just assume
that it's an image and go on with their way.

00:25:41.310 --> 00:25:43.310
If this is really important content,

00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:48.480
let's put it front
and center for users to find.

00:25:49.150 --> 00:25:53.570
Another thing is ensuring
that your target size is good.

00:25:54.070 --> 00:25:58.740
A lot of sliders love those little
dotted navigations,

00:25:59.030 --> 00:26:01.490
and usually those dots are really tiny.

00:26:01.620 --> 00:26:09.090
Let's enlarge those and make sure
that they're big enough,

00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:15.590
as well as ensuring that sliders have
proper ARIA attributes so that way,

00:26:15.590 --> 00:26:20.310
users on assistive technologies know
what's going on

00:26:20.430 --> 00:26:25.890
and how to get to the content
that you're trying to show them.

00:26:28.940 --> 00:26:29.560
All right.

00:26:29.730 --> 00:26:32.940
We are a little bit out of the animation
realm.

00:26:32.940 --> 00:26:33.610
Take a breath.

00:26:35.030 --> 00:26:39.120
We are moving more into content-based
items.

00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:40.870
Another hydration break here.

00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:46.500
[silence] All right.

00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:50.040
First up is accordions and toggles.

00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:54.960
These items are great for being able
to display a lot

00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:57.300
of content in a small area,

00:26:57.720 --> 00:27:01.800
but they can really be problematic
for keyboard users

00:27:01.890 --> 00:27:04.180
and users of assistive technologies.

00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:09.400
A lot of times, I've entered an accordion

00:27:09.400 --> 00:27:13.190
or a toggle on a site built
with a page builder,

00:27:13.190 --> 00:27:16.950
and it just doesn't work with a keyboard.

00:27:18.780 --> 00:27:23.200
You should be able to--
Here on the screen,

00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:26.330
I have a screenshot of an accordion.

00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:32.250
This one was actually taken
from Oxygen Extra's site.

00:27:32.630 --> 00:27:36.300
One of the things that they tout on
there is accessible markup,

00:27:36.380 --> 00:27:40.680
which from what I saw, it was accessible.

00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:42.140
They had all the ARIA.

00:27:42.550 --> 00:27:48.270
You should be able to tab on your computer
to the different titles

00:27:48.270 --> 00:27:52.940
within this accordion and then hit enter,
and then you can pop--

00:27:52.940 --> 00:27:55.610
that will pop open
and you can read the content.

00:27:58.150 --> 00:28:00.530
On several page builders out there,

00:28:00.530 --> 00:28:06.540
unfortunately, whenever you tab to it
and you hit enter, it does nothing.

00:28:06.580 --> 00:28:10.540
This is why proper markup is so important.

00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:13.330
Whenever we can mark it up properly
to work,

00:28:13.330 --> 00:28:17.630
why would we do it any other way?

00:28:19.220 --> 00:28:20.550
I really don't know.

00:28:22.340 --> 00:28:28.600
Under a similar nature,
waving us in here is tabs.

00:28:29.430 --> 00:28:34.270
In the same way, tabs are also great
for organizing large amounts

00:28:34.270 --> 00:28:38.280
of content while keeping it compact
and easy to understand,

00:28:39.190 --> 00:28:44.950
but these can be problematic
for mobile users, keyboard users,

00:28:45.070 --> 00:28:47.450
and users of assistive technology.

00:28:48.490 --> 00:28:52.920
Again, this is a proceed with caution,
ensuring proper markup.

00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:59.920
The W3C does also have an example
of this of what proper markup looks like.

00:29:00.300 --> 00:29:04.340
If you're curious and then like a tab
on your website,

00:29:04.590 --> 00:29:07.100
that's a great resource to go to.

00:29:07.890 --> 00:29:09.930
I have a couple screenshots here.

00:29:10.270 --> 00:29:15.810
I have one screenshot on this slide
of a tab on desktop.

00:29:16.940 --> 00:29:20.400
If you are a user navigating
via a keyboard,

00:29:20.780 --> 00:29:27.410
you should be able to hit the tab key
and land on the first tab.

00:29:27.700 --> 00:29:30.830
There's three tabs in the screenshot,

00:29:30.830 --> 00:29:33.460
and then we see a simple
content underneath there.

00:29:33.750 --> 00:29:38.840
You would be able to navigate
to the other tabs via your arrow keys,

00:29:39.250 --> 00:29:44.630
and then you can also hit tab
should there be any linked content

00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:46.550
within the tabs themselves.

00:29:46.890 --> 00:29:53.020
Some of these tab modules,
widgets are marked up better

00:29:53.020 --> 00:29:56.980
on some page builders
than they are on others.

00:29:57.310 --> 00:30:01.320
I've taken this screenshot
and the following from a site

00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:03.320
that was built on Elementor.

00:30:03.950 --> 00:30:09.410
Then the one thing to also watch out
for is tabs on mobile.

00:30:09.410 --> 00:30:11.580
Whenever you get to a smaller screen,

00:30:11.620 --> 00:30:15.420
they have the tendency
just to want to squish together,

00:30:15.460 --> 00:30:18.500
making all that text very difficult
to read.

00:30:19.750 --> 00:30:23.210
That's why I really like
Elementor's approach.

00:30:24.300 --> 00:30:29.890
On this slide, I'm showing an example
of what the tabs look like on mobile.

00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:39.310
They shrink down to an accordion-like view,
giving the user a more open layout,

00:30:39.310 --> 00:30:42.820
a larger target size,
and ensuring that

00:30:42.820 --> 00:30:47.410
none of those elements end up overlapping,

00:30:47.490 --> 00:30:50.780
just making it a little bit easier to use.

00:30:54.580 --> 00:30:55.160
All right.

00:30:55.500 --> 00:30:58.790
We're coming into our video section.

00:31:00.170 --> 00:31:05.670
Page builders love giving
their users different video options,

00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:09.720
and one of the biggies is overlay images.

00:31:10.350 --> 00:31:15.640
These are images that you can put
on top of your video to fancy it up,

00:31:16.230 --> 00:31:19.100
but you have to watch out
with these kinds of features.

00:31:19.230 --> 00:31:22.400
Because though they may make
your video look a little bit nicer,

00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:24.280
they can serve as a keyboard trap.

00:31:25.280 --> 00:31:29.490
What ends up happening is that the user
is tabbing through your website,

00:31:29.860 --> 00:31:36.040
they get to the video and their focus
ends up going to the player controls

00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:38.960
that are underneath that overlay image,

00:31:39.290 --> 00:31:42.840
so then the user has no clue
where they are on the website.

00:31:43.590 --> 00:31:45.670
It's frustrating, really.

00:31:47.340 --> 00:31:54.010
Then there's the autoplay option,
which should be purely avoided,

00:31:55.100 --> 00:31:59.850
that no user loves to show up on a site
and get bombarded with audio

00:31:59.850 --> 00:32:01.730
that they don't know
where it's coming from,

00:32:02.110 --> 00:32:04.980
or unexpected movement
or anything like that.

00:32:05.820 --> 00:32:08.490
Let them play the video for themselves.

00:32:08.950 --> 00:32:12.320
Then the other option is player controls.

00:32:12.490 --> 00:32:15.330
For some reason, page builders offer this,

00:32:15.330 --> 00:32:19.790
where you can turn the player
controls off of a video.

00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:25.210
Things like the play button, volume,
seeking through the video,

00:32:25.210 --> 00:32:28.510
just let the users have it.

00:32:28.510 --> 00:32:31.510
Make these videos accessible for all.

00:32:33.220 --> 00:32:36.390
Here I have a screenshot
of the video options

00:32:36.390 --> 00:32:41.190
within an Elementor editor
with the autoplay,

00:32:41.770 --> 00:32:47.730
mute and loop all turned off,
and the player controls is set to on,

00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:54.620
which is the ideal settings
that you are going for.

00:32:56.200 --> 00:33:01.120
Then here's a screenshot of what
an image overlay settings

00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:03.250
might look like within your page builder.

00:33:03.250 --> 00:33:06.170
This one was taken from Elementor.

00:33:06.420 --> 00:33:12.220
We can see the image overlay section
with the image overlay set to on,

00:33:12.220 --> 00:33:16.680
and then there's just a placeholder
in that area.

00:33:18.930 --> 00:33:23.980
Then the videos continue here
with background videos.

00:33:24.020 --> 00:33:28.190
Background videos are popular
for hero backgrounds,

00:33:28.570 --> 00:33:33.780
but that continuous movement
can be distressing for users.

00:33:34.660 --> 00:33:39.200
I find that offering a clear
pause/play button for the user

00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:44.670
to be able to stop the video
should they wish is a good option.

00:33:44.670 --> 00:33:50.130
Unfortunately, I haven't found
a page builder that has this baked in,

00:33:50.130 --> 00:33:55.720
so I've always had to add some custom
code to do it myself, but it is possible.

00:33:56.260 --> 00:34:00.100
Any page-builder people listening out there,
please add this as an option.

00:34:00.140 --> 00:34:02.390
We would all love you very much.

00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:09.570
Then also ensuring that those background
videos have a good contrast for--

00:34:09.570 --> 00:34:14.030
if you're overlaying any text,
that adding a dark overlay

00:34:14.030 --> 00:34:16.320
can be a good solution for that.

00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:20.030
I just have a screenshot.

00:34:20.080 --> 00:34:24.790
Again, I wasn't going to subject you
to all the movement of a video,

00:34:24.870 --> 00:34:26.790
but in the screenshot,

00:34:26.790 --> 00:34:33.090
we can see that there is a little pause
button up in the upper right-hand corner.

00:34:33.380 --> 00:34:38.180
Then we have some white text
and there's a dark overlay,

00:34:38.260 --> 00:34:42.890
so the user can easily read the content.

00:34:45.890 --> 00:34:46.440
All right.

00:34:46.730 --> 00:34:49.650
Now we're getting into
a little bit of a biggie.

00:34:49.980 --> 00:34:53.610
It is our dynamic post filtering.

00:34:55.030 --> 00:35:01.700
A lot of page builders will offer
like category filtering for blog posts

00:35:01.700 --> 00:35:03.330
and different things like that.

00:35:03.910 --> 00:35:08.630
Unfortunately,
these usually aren't marked up properly.

00:35:09.330 --> 00:35:11.380
Whenever the results are on the same page,

00:35:11.380 --> 00:35:15.380
they are often missing
those proper status messages,

00:35:16.930 --> 00:35:20.760
refocusing the user to where
they should be after the update,

00:35:21.100 --> 00:35:23.890
and including a proper submit button.

00:35:24.890 --> 00:35:29.100
This is a proceed with caution,
but definitely,

00:35:29.100 --> 00:35:34.940
with proper markup,
you can make it work for you.

00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:42.200
Unfortunately, a lot of that proper markup
is going to be through some custom code.

00:35:43.790 --> 00:35:49.040
On the on screen here,
I have an example of some post filters

00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:52.130
that I pulled from
the Oxygen Builder website.

00:35:52.790 --> 00:35:55.710
We see some button filters on the left.

00:35:56.460 --> 00:35:59.260
Which button filters are great.

00:35:59.260 --> 00:36:00.720
You can select one.

00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:07.430
Then if the content changes,
we can serve the user a status message,

00:36:07.930 --> 00:36:09.850
so if they're on assistive technology,

00:36:09.850 --> 00:36:12.480
they know that something
on the page has changed.

00:36:12.980 --> 00:36:16.110
Then we update those blog posts.

00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:18.530
If, say, this were a dropdown,

00:36:18.610 --> 00:36:22.030
where the user has to select
an item from the dropdown,

00:36:22.410 --> 00:36:26.660
then we would want to ensure that
there's a nice apply button.

00:36:26.870 --> 00:36:31.790
That way, we're not changing
those results on an input.

00:36:32.670 --> 00:36:34.750
Just keeping a close eye on that.

00:36:36.090 --> 00:36:41.890
Then last but not least,
waving us in is our contact forms.

00:36:41.930 --> 00:36:47.220
A lot of page builders
have built-in contact forms that,

00:36:47.470 --> 00:36:51.770
unfortunately,
aren't marked up properly with proper labels,

00:36:51.900 --> 00:36:56.110
required field indication,
and proper validation messages.

00:36:57.190 --> 00:37:00.780
This is something that is a proceed
with caution.

00:37:00.780 --> 00:37:05.620
There's a lot of good third-party
plugins out there, such as Gravity Forms,

00:37:06.080 --> 00:37:12.000
that offer you a little bit more flexibility
and better leverage over your forms.

00:37:13.670 --> 00:37:17.750
An example here,
I pulled this from the Divi website,

00:37:17.800 --> 00:37:20.260
is we have a contact form,

00:37:20.720 --> 00:37:25.260
and they're using placeholders
instead of labels.

00:37:25.640 --> 00:37:30.230
If a user begins to type in there,
they won't remember what field they're on.

00:37:30.230 --> 00:37:32.190
It's problematic.

00:37:32.190 --> 00:37:33.770
It's hard to use.

00:37:34.850 --> 00:37:40.650
Then if they were to hit submit,
we see a screenshot

00:37:40.690 --> 00:37:45.320
of the submitted version
where there's validation errors.

00:37:48.030 --> 00:37:51.580
There's no required indication on these.

00:37:52.830 --> 00:37:56.130
It just says,
"Please fill in the following fields,"

00:37:56.130 --> 00:38:01.670
and lists name and message,
but there's still nothing telling you

00:38:01.670 --> 00:38:03.840
that these fields are required.

00:38:05.470 --> 00:38:07.890
We entered an invalid email address

00:38:07.890 --> 00:38:09.560
and it just says, "Invalid email,"

00:38:09.560 --> 00:38:15.520
but it doesn't give us any good reason
of why or how to fix it.

00:38:17.360 --> 00:38:19.690
I pulled another example here.

00:38:19.730 --> 00:38:26.410
We have a screenshot, and we can see
that we have the email labels

00:38:26.740 --> 00:38:29.490
with the required indicators on them.

00:38:29.530 --> 00:38:35.370
Then you have an invalid email address
typed in, just email@ex.

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:39.130
We get a proper validation message
this time that says,

00:38:39.130 --> 00:38:41.090
"The email address entered is invalid.

00:38:41.090 --> 00:38:42.630
Please check the formatting,"

00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:47.140
and then gives an example
of a proper email address.

00:38:47.180 --> 00:38:52.640
That is a better way to let users know that,
hey, you messed up.

00:38:54.730 --> 00:38:56.600
Here's how you can easily fix it.

00:38:58.650 --> 00:39:01.230
That leads us to our wrap-up.

00:39:02.570 --> 00:39:05.400
At the end of the day, page builders are-

00:39:05.450 --> 00:39:10.070
they can be super helpful
and these incredibly flexible tools,

00:39:10.070 --> 00:39:12.700
but they come with a lot of responsibility

00:39:12.990 --> 00:39:19.000
at not just blindly trusting
these page builders,

00:39:20.040 --> 00:39:24.010
and ensuring that we are doing all
the testing and everything as needed.

00:39:24.590 --> 00:39:30.220
Today I will not be giving you
what I think the best,

00:39:30.220 --> 00:39:32.970
most accessible page builder is,

00:39:33.390 --> 00:39:36.270
but if that is something
that you are curious in,

00:39:36.270 --> 00:39:40.310
there are lots of blog posts and podcasts.

00:39:40.940 --> 00:39:43.440
I know that there's some
that just recently happened

00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:47.110
that go over all that
and give a better look.

00:39:48.030 --> 00:39:51.160
Then now we're at time for questions.

00:39:53.410 --> 00:39:54.740
<v Simon> Thank you so much, Scarlett.

00:39:54.740 --> 00:39:57.910
That was very informative and insightful.

00:39:59.170 --> 00:40:02.710
Some great examples
from various page builders

00:40:03.170 --> 00:40:05.460
and a lot of useful information there.

00:40:05.460 --> 00:40:11.840
We do have a bunch of questions,
so we'll get to them as we can.

00:40:14.100 --> 00:40:21.230
Rosita asks, "I have a problem
with the section tag in Elementor.

00:40:21.440 --> 00:40:26.610
It converts all of the inner containers
into sections automatically.

00:40:27.900 --> 00:40:29.240
That is not correct, right?"

00:40:32.910 --> 00:40:33.450
<v Scarlett> Yes.

00:40:33.950 --> 00:40:38.040
Elementor now offers
a container structure as well.

00:40:38.040 --> 00:40:44.000
Their previous version, every one of those--
every section,

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:49.340
is literally what they call it,
did have the section tag on it.

00:40:49.920 --> 00:40:54.510
Now if you are switching over
to their new container structure,

00:40:54.550 --> 00:40:56.930
though it may look scary,
I do recommend it.

00:40:56.930 --> 00:41:01.480
It gives you a lot more flexibility
to be able to assign those landmarks,

00:41:01.690 --> 00:41:04.730
like I showed within that screenshot.

00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:09.150
<v Simon> Great.

00:41:09.150 --> 00:41:10.360
Thank you for that.

00:41:13.360 --> 00:41:13.990
All right.

00:41:15.410 --> 00:41:21.410
David says that Elementor Pro's custom
attributes are added

00:41:21.460 --> 00:41:25.170
to the wrapper div
instead of the inner element.

00:41:29.340 --> 00:41:36.100
Is that a good way for remediating
accessibility issues?

00:41:38.390 --> 00:41:40.560
<v Scarlett> Not always.

00:41:41.060 --> 00:41:43.650
You will want to make sure
that wherever your--

00:41:44.100 --> 00:41:48.480
your custom attribute is being applied
to wherever it's needed.

00:41:48.780 --> 00:41:52.610
For instance, in our primary nav example,

00:41:53.200 --> 00:41:58.790
you would want to make sure that
it is getting applied where that nav tag is.

00:41:58.790 --> 00:42:02.000
Unfortunately,
sometimes within page builders,

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:04.710
it's hard to tell exactly
where it's going to add it,

00:42:04.710 --> 00:42:08.340
and a lot of times it does end up
adding it to that wrapper.

00:42:10.460 --> 00:42:14.260
That's where adding some custom code
and things like that,

00:42:14.260 --> 00:42:17.010
unfortunately, come in.

00:42:17.640 --> 00:42:20.060
Ultimately,
I would say just do your testing

00:42:20.060 --> 00:42:22.310
and make sure that it makes sense
where it's at.

00:42:25.440 --> 00:42:26.560
<v Simon> All right, thank you.

00:42:28.980 --> 00:42:34.030
Someone mentions that sliders are the one

00:42:34.030 --> 00:42:38.120
and only for everyone
in the world of websites.

00:42:40.200 --> 00:42:45.080
I've got my clients to not do it,
use sliders, I guess,

00:42:45.080 --> 00:42:47.500
but what alternatives do you use?

00:42:47.830 --> 00:42:51.250
Can you explain or give a URL,

00:42:51.250 --> 00:42:54.170
an example about
how to make a slider accessible?

00:42:56.760 --> 00:42:57.300
<v Scarlett> Yes.

00:42:58.850 --> 00:43:02.970
My recommendation is just don't.

00:43:03.020 --> 00:43:07.150
I know that that's not the most popular
answer for some clients.

00:43:07.150 --> 00:43:09.400
I know that some really like it.

00:43:09.810 --> 00:43:12.230
If you can provide them a good argument--

00:43:12.690 --> 00:43:15.950
I know a lot like sliders
within the heroes.

00:43:17.860 --> 00:43:21.530
If you can compromise on having
a background image

00:43:21.530 --> 00:43:23.540
with maybe some overlaid text,

00:43:24.040 --> 00:43:27.830
ensuring that there's a nice background
overlay for that high contrast.

00:43:28.370 --> 00:43:33.920
Then I usually recommend
an image-text section,

00:43:33.920 --> 00:43:36.380
so something that has an image
and some text,

00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:41.390
just so that way the user can see
everything laid out for them.

00:43:42.010 --> 00:43:43.640
I think the argument here is really,

00:43:43.810 --> 00:43:47.100
don't be hiding this content
from your users.

00:43:47.100 --> 00:43:50.150
It can really affect
a company's bottom line,

00:43:50.150 --> 00:43:52.190
if you happen to be building
for a company,

00:43:52.570 --> 00:43:56.150
that users are missing out on
a lot of things or getting frustrated.

00:43:56.400 --> 00:43:58.360
Oh, and for an accessible slider,

00:43:58.360 --> 00:44:03.120
I know that the W3C does have examples

00:44:03.120 --> 00:44:06.750
of what an accessible slider markup
looks like as well.

00:44:07.750 --> 00:44:07.960
<v Simon> Yes.

00:44:07.960 --> 00:44:12.670
Just to confirm, you're talking about
slider carousels for images

00:44:12.670 --> 00:44:13.750
and other content, right?

00:44:13.750 --> 00:44:17.380
Not just form control sliders
that are custom components, correct?

00:44:17.380 --> 00:44:18.470
<v Scarlett> Correct, yes.

00:44:18.510 --> 00:44:19.630
Thank you, Simon.

00:44:19.630 --> 00:44:19.930
Yes.

00:44:20.220 --> 00:44:20.840
<v Simon> Sure, yes.

00:44:22.220 --> 00:44:27.060
Paul asks, "Can you please address
how to make a mega menu accessible?"

00:44:27.770 --> 00:44:28.310
<v Scarlett> Oh, boy.

00:44:28.640 --> 00:44:30.980
Paul, you're really going
for the gusto here, Paul.

00:44:34.650 --> 00:44:40.200
Within our limited time, probably not.

00:44:42.240 --> 00:44:45.910
I think there's ensuring that--

00:44:46.080 --> 00:44:50.750
Well, kind of goes with ensuring that
all your landmarks and ARIA labels--

00:44:50.750 --> 00:44:54.170
there's a lot of ARIA labeling
and everything that goes into mega menus.

00:44:55.090 --> 00:45:01.050
That's a little bit of a bigger topic,
maybe a topic for next year.

00:45:01.260 --> 00:45:02.680
[laughter]

00:45:04.390 --> 00:45:04.890
<v Simon> Well said.

00:45:07.140 --> 00:45:08.100
Let's see.

00:45:12.980 --> 00:45:14.690
Basa, I hope I got that name right,

00:45:15.690 --> 00:45:18.480
says that utilizing accordions,
accordion-like,

00:45:19.070 --> 00:45:23.280
or the details tag is said
not to be accessible.

00:45:25.070 --> 00:45:28.120
They've heard that from a few sessions
or webinars.

00:45:28.830 --> 00:45:33.630
The user cannot put the list
of all headings

00:45:34.420 --> 00:45:37.880
into those sections in the heading tree

00:45:38.380 --> 00:45:40.340
since they are all collapsed,

00:45:41.130 --> 00:45:45.600
so the assistive technology users
may miss some content.

00:45:46.300 --> 00:45:47.760
What is your take on that,

00:45:48.140 --> 00:45:51.180
about accordions and details and stuff,
I guess?

00:45:52.480 --> 00:45:58.110
<v Scarlett> Yes, that's a good call-out
and a good question.

00:45:59.070 --> 00:46:04.740
I would say, one,
I would recommend keeping the content

00:46:04.740 --> 00:46:08.120
within your accordion relatively simple.

00:46:09.080 --> 00:46:14.830
Personally, I haven't dived into
the details tag so much on accordions.

00:46:15.250 --> 00:46:19.130
I haven't really found them necessary
within my markup,

00:46:19.130 --> 00:46:24.630
but maybe I'm missing something,
so somebody inform me if I am.

00:46:27.180 --> 00:46:27.510
<v Simon> Okay.

00:46:27.510 --> 00:46:29.930
We have time for one more, I think.

00:46:32.520 --> 00:46:39.110
Someone asked, "Would you explain
dynamic post filtering again?

00:46:39.150 --> 00:46:42.570
Is it sort of a blog default?"

00:46:44.780 --> 00:46:45.200
<v Scarlett> Yes.

00:46:45.820 --> 00:46:51.740
The post filtering-- so if you go to,
say, a blog landing page,

00:46:51.740 --> 00:46:54.000
for example, and they'll give you a list

00:46:54.000 --> 00:47:01.340
of categories to search by
to help filter down your post results,

00:47:01.670 --> 00:47:04.970
so that's what I mean by
the dynamic post filtering.

00:47:04.970 --> 00:47:09.680
It's these filters that apply
it to these posts.

00:47:10.180 --> 00:47:15.520
Then whenever you apply that,
there's a lot of- as I covered,

00:47:15.520 --> 00:47:20.270
a lot of markup and different things
that can get lost within there.

00:47:20.270 --> 00:47:24.110
It's a little simple,
but hopefully that helped a little bit.

00:47:24.110 --> 00:47:28.410
A good third-party plugin, if you're having
issues with that on your site,

00:47:28.410 --> 00:47:31.120
is like FacetWP or something like that,

00:47:31.120 --> 00:47:34.790
that gives you more leverage
over different kinds of filters.

00:47:34.790 --> 00:47:39.080
I wouldn't say it's necessarily
a blog default.

00:47:39.130 --> 00:47:42.630
You typically see it on
a little bit more advanced sites

00:47:42.630 --> 00:47:45.260
or sites that have more extensive blogs.

00:47:47.010 --> 00:47:47.550
<v Simon> Great.

00:47:47.550 --> 00:47:48.510
Thank you so much.

00:47:49.510 --> 00:47:50.510
There are a bunch of other questions,

00:47:50.510 --> 00:47:52.560
but unfortunately,
we're just about out of time.

00:47:53.350 --> 00:47:59.440
I want to thank you again, Scarlett,
