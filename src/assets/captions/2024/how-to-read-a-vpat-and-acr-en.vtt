<v Announcer> WordPress
Accessibility Day 2024.

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.777
How to Read a VPAT and ACR

00:00:06.778 --> 00:00:10.428
with Speaker Gian Wild,
CEO at AccessibilityOz.

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.639
This presentation
was recorded October 2024.

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:17.099
<v Kelly Crowley> Hello,
everyone, and welcome

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.400
to WordPress Accessibility Day 2024.

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.199
My name is Kelly Crowley.

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.719
I'm an accessible design consultant,
a writer, and a coach.

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.279
I'm also a Paralympian
and a member of the disability community.

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:30.779
Thank you for joining us

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:35.417
for How to Read a VPAT
and ACR with Gian Wild.

00:00:35.542 --> 00:00:38.435
Gian is the CEO of AccessibilityOz,

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.359
which has offices in the US,
Europe, and Australia.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.479
She has worked
in the accessibility industry

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.079
since 1998 when she was on
the very first accessible--

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:52.199
worked on the very first accessible
Australian website.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.119
Her major achievements
include six years active

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.159
membership in the W3C WCAG working group,

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.799
her speech on the importance
of web accessibility

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.119
at the United Nations Conference
of State Parties in 2015,

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.579
and the release of the ICT Mobile Site

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.839
and Native App Accessibility
Testing Guidelines.

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.779
In 2019, Gian won
the inaugural Accessibility Person

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.846
of the Year in Australia.

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.239
She speaks at conferences in Australia,

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.572
the US, Canada, South America, and Europe.

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.839
During the webinar today,
please feel free to use the Q&amp;A

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.439
section in Zoom to ask your questions,

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.839
and we'll answer them
at the end of the session.

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.959
You can use the chat to connect
with other attendees.

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.292
With that, I'll turn it over to you, Gian.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.119
<v Gian Wild> Thank you very much.

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:46.240
I am just going to share my screen.

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:57.399
Let me know if you have any trouble,
I was going to say understanding me,

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:58.919
but because I'm Australian

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.919
and there might be some non-Australians

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.839
on the call,
you may have trouble understanding me.

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.839
In fact, I remember speaking
at Michigan State University,

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.319
and a woman came up
to me afterwards and said,

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:11.759
"Oh, I just loved your presentation.

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.319
Didn't understand a word you said,

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:16.494
but I thought the speech was fantastic."

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.119
I thought, that's not
what we're going for here.

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.079
Please let me know
if you need me to slow down.

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.519
I can talk fast.

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.879
I know the accent
can be a problem for some.

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.819
Today we're going to talk
about how to read

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:34.859
a VPAT and-- well, really an ACR.

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.519
We're going to talk about the differences
of what those two things are.

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:40.799
Firstly, meet our team.

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.279
My team as a little bit different now.

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:47.320
This is back in 2018, BC,
I like to say, Before COVID.

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:54.440
I've been running AccessibilityOz
for 14 years, come April 2025.

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:59.919
I've always wanted to support
people with disabilities

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.279
by providing employment opportunities.

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.400
I wanted to make sure that my staff

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:09.559
or the percentage of people
with disabilities in my staff

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.839
were more than or at least
the population of people

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.519
with disabilities
in the general population.

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:21.359
I actually have never had any lower
than 60% of my staff

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:26.914
have some kind of significant
disability that affects their daily life.

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:33.232
It's really important that you look at us,
and we all look very "normal."

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.999
That's really important to know
is that when it comes to disabilities,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.779
it's not something
that you can necessarily tell

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:42.719
just by looking at someone.

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.919
We have Raph here who's wearing glasses.

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.719
Could be that it was a very sunny day.

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:53.159
He actually is legally blind,
but you don't really know.

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.799
People aren't always
going to disclose their disability.

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:00.479
It's really quite rude to actually
ask someone if they have a disability.

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:06.599
You really need to assume
that your audience has a disability.

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.119
For those people who don't know,

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:14.839
about 20% of any population
has some significant

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:18.093
disability that affects their daily life.

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:23.079
Over the years,
we've had staff with dyslexia,

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.479
moderate vision impairments,

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:27.879
epilepsy, migraines,
severe vision impairments,

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:32.799
physical impairments, PTSD,
Crohn's disease, multiple sclerosis,

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:38.159
and one that I haven't put on there yet,
unfortunately, is long COVID.

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.159
I personally have been suffering
from long COVID

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:45.960
since I caught it at CSUN in 2023,
so 18 months.

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:50.486
All these things can affect
how people use websites.

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:51.839
The other thing to remember

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.479
is that it's not just about
vision impairments.

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:57.719
Especially looking at VPATs, I often see--

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.999
We tested with this screen reader,
and full stop.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.039
That's all the testing they did.

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:04.319
Well, there's a much
larger group of people

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:07.119
with disabilities than just
people with screen readers.

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:11.519
In fact, there's a much larger group
of people with vision

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:14.879
impairments than just
people who use screen readers.

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:17.679
The largest group
of people with disabilities

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:21.079
who use the web are actually people
with cognitive disabilities.

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:23.639
That's another thing to remember.

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:26.576
Just very quickly going to put this--

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:29.919
speak this slide,
but I'm not going to go into it in detail.

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:33.439
In terms of our services,
we work all around the world.

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:37.879
We were the accessibility partners
for the Birmingham Commonwealth Games.

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:40.399
We do audits, mobile testing,

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:43.879
building websites, CMS testing,
accessibility design,

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:48.199
video accessibility, user testing,
OS browser testing, consultation,

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:49.559
and accessibility testing.

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:54.719
I put that in there because often
people say, "Oh, I saw a presentation,

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:56.439
and we went with
this accessibility company."

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:57.919
I was like, "You could have come to us."

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:00.919
They're like,
"Oh, we didn't know you did that stuff."

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:03.512
I thought I'd put that slide in.

00:06:03.513 --> 00:06:05.339
We have a few products.

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:08.379
OzArt, our automated
accessibility testing tool.

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:13.220
OzWiki, our accessibility
database of accessibility solutions,

00:06:13.993 --> 00:06:16.619
well, errors, solutions, examples.

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:20.680
OzPlayer, accessible video player.

00:06:20.757 --> 00:06:22.519
The Accessibility Factsheets

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:26.639
and Accessibility Voices
and Videos are all available

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:28.439
for free on our website.

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:31.199
If we have time at the end,
I can show you where they are,

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:35.159
but you're also welcome to just
go to our website and find them.

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:37.199
Videos are aimed mostly at developers.

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:41.999
The factsheets are aimed at testers
and developers and managers.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.119
A little bit about me.

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:45.239
Why should you listen to me?

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:47.953
I worked, as Amber said,

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:52.559
the very first accessible
website in Australia,

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:55.639
the Vision Australia
Foundation website in '98.

00:06:55.640 --> 00:07:01.039
I created Australia's first automated
accessibility testing tool in 2000.

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:05.520
I spent six years
with the W3C working on WCAG2.

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:09.699
I worked on the Melbourne
2006 Commonwealth Games

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:12.639
and every Commonwealth Games since then.

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:15.972
Then I spent five years managing usability

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:19.136
and accessibility services at Monash.

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:21.979
For those people who are from a university

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:24.880
or from a college, I feel your pain.

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:27.719
I founded AccessibilityOz in 2011.

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:30.400
We released OzPlayer in 2013.

00:07:30.576 --> 00:07:32.440
OzArt in 2014.

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:35.779
I spoke at the United Nations
on the importance

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:40.199
of web accessibility
with regards to the massive fires

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:43.319
that we had in Victoria
a few years before,

00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:49.199
where over 50% of the people who died,
so 160 people, I think, died,

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:54.159
but over 50% had some kind of disability,
which was quite appalling.

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:57.279
There was a Royal Commission,
which was like an investigation into it,

00:07:57.280 --> 00:07:59.677
and that was never mentioned.

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:00.879
It's really important,

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:03.479
especially if you're dealing
with emergency procedures,

00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:06.380
that everything is fully accessible.

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:10.299
I was the inaugural Accessibility Person

00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:13.679
of the Year in 2019
and the last few years.

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:15.999
As well as running AccessibilityOz,

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.039
I've been chairing

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:19.839
the Mobile Accessibility
Testing Guidelines.

00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:22.159
If you are interested
in mobile accessibility,

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:27.080
there's plenty of webinars
and things on our website.

00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:29.799
There's certainly a lot of information

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:34.240
on how you make mobile
accessibility a thing.

00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:38.215
Let's talk about VPATs and ACRs.

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:41.519
What is the difference
between a VPAT and ACR?

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:43.759
Really, it's very, very easy.

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:47.679
The VPAT is what you download
from the internet,

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:52.199
and the ACR is what you send
to people or what a vendor sends to you.

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:54.599
The VPAT is basically the full template.

00:08:54.600 --> 00:09:01.040
The ACR is the filled-out template,
is the short version of that.

00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:05.399
I'm going to use
the term ACR instead of VPAT,

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:11.880
even though the term VPAT
is more commonly used.

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:16.679
When I'm talking about an ACR,
it's the filled-out version,

00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:19.490
but they are used interchangeably.

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:22.719
Basically, what is an ACR?

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:26.639
It's an explanation of the accessibility
compliance of a product.

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:31.559
It's not a sales document,
even though it often gets used as one.

00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:36.239
It's basically a point in time
where it says this is,

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:37.399
at this point in time,

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:41.605
where the accessibility compliance
of this product is.

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:42.839
We've got these issues,

00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:46.879
we don't have those issues,
we fix these things.

00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:51.800
It's owned and often assessed
or created by the product vendor,

00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:56.399
but it's always more, I believe,

00:09:56.400 --> 00:10:00.359
if there's a third-party that does
the assessment.

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:04.119
In order to fill out the ACR properly,
you really need to conduct

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:06.919
a complete accessibility
audit on a product.

00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:08.999
It's not just a case of filling
out a document.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.519
You have to do quite extensive
testing to determine

00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:14.279
where the accessibility compliance

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:18.539
of the document is to then fill
out the ACR.

00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:21.979
It's required by Section 508 in the US

00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:24.439
and almost all federal solicitations.

00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:28.010
It's very common
in universities and colleges.

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:32.319
Even in Australia, it's something
that we sometimes can request

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:36.279
or my clients request because it gives

00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:40.339
an idea of where
the accessibility compliance is

00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:45.576
and what people have done to meet
those accessibility requirements.

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:48.359
It's not actually, though,

00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:51.359
an accessibility audit
report of a product.

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:53.639
It tells you what
the accessibility compliance is,

00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:56.799
but it's not actually an audit report.

00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:58.839
It's not only for government.

00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:01.639
It's something
that can be used by everyone.

00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:03.119
It's not only for web products.

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:06.960
You can actually get
an ACR for your photocopier

00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:11.039
or your smart TV or something like that.

00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:14.159
It's, unfortunately, not always accurate.

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:16.479
I'll talk about that in a moment.

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:19.971
It's not a good indicator
of ATAG compliance.

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:23.519
Now, ATAG is the Authoring
Tool Accessibility Guidelines,

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:27.119
very different to the Web
Content Accessibility Guidelines.

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:29.639
The Authoring
Tool Accessibility Guidelines,

00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:33.759
you'd want to apply them
or test them when you're dealing

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:38.079
with anything that's author's content,
so WordPress, for example.

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:42.999
An ACR of WordPress
is not necessarily a good indicator

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.120
of ATAG compliance
for that particular product.

00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:52.719
There are different categories,
web products, operating systems,

00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:55.039
desktop software, photocopiers,

00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:58.902
telephones, tablets,
smartphones, et cetera.

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:02.039
Then when it comes
to the sections of an ACR,

00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:04.850
they're always the same, no matter

00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:11.039
what you're testing until you get further
on into the WCAG section.

00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:15.079
The first section is title,
which should be the company name,

00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:18.079
and then accessibility conformance report,

00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:20.519
name of the product, and the version.

00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:22.579
Now, the version,
it's really important to have

00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:27.463
that information
because if you have an ACR on Version 2.4,

00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:30.599
but you're actually implementing
Version 3.5,

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:34.039
then that ACR
is not going to be very accurate.

00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:36.639
It's also important that
there's a product description,

00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:40.519
and it's important that this is
a good product description.

00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:44.119
I've looked at hundreds,
maybe thousands of ACRs,

00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:46.930
and a lot of them are very salesy.

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:51.359
It's really important that, as I said,
it's not a sales document,

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:52.919
it's actual description

00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:57.440
of what it is that the ACR
or what the product does.

00:12:57.640 --> 00:12:59.376
Then the report date.

00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:03.359
It's important to look
at that as well and determine

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:07.881
whether you're happy
with how old the ACR is.

00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:10.799
Then there's also contact information.

00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:13.679
It's always important, I think,

00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:17.479
to have a phone number
as well as an email address

00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:20.999
for an actual human
and a human person's name,

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.119
as opposed to accessibility
at wordpress.org or something

00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:28.279
like that so that there
is actually one person

00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:32.720
who is responsible
for this and that can be contacted.

00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:35.159
It's also important that that person

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:41.040
has the ability and the time to actually
respond to any questions

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:44.988
about the ACR.

00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:46.639
Then there's notes.

00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:50.519
Notes often will mention
things that might be excluded

00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:55.280
or maybe some information
about when fixes will be completed,

00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:58.199
and then the evaluation methods used.

00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:00.719
This is really, really important.

00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:05.679
Evaluation methods used should talk
about automated testing tools,

00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:08.279
automated accessibility testing tools,

00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:11.599
as well as manual accessibility testing,

00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:15.839
as well as some assistive
technology testing,

00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:20.839
including mobile and including
mobile assistive technology testing.

00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:25.119
Often, we use these automated
accessibility testing tools.

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:28.294
We did this manual testing and we tested

00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:33.120
with JAWS on Windows and NVDA on Windows.

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:36.599
Then the question is,
well, what about Mac users?

00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:40.639
Then the question is,
how does this work on a mobile phone?

00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:44.607
Then you have the report information
and the terms.

00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:49.239
The accessibility section
of the ACR is really--

00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:53.207
there's tables for each WCAG
standard or guideline.

00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:58.539
There's a table for WCAG 2, 2.1, or 2.2,

00:14:58.540 --> 00:15:00.884
depending on how old the ACR is.

00:15:00.885 --> 00:15:04.679
There's a table for Level A,
table for Level AA.

00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:07.439
I haven't yet seen an ACR
that has a table for AAA,

00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:09.479
but you can have it there if you want.

00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:13.779
Then there's additional sections
for Section 508 requirements,

00:15:13.780 --> 00:15:16.057
if the person uses it.

00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:22.280
How do you tell if an ACR
is reasonable in 10 minutes or less?

00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:27.039
I do actually have an article that talks
about these things

00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:29.879
as well, which I will post at the end.

00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:36.560
I'm sure that you'll get access
to this video, as well as my slides.

00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:40.200
Red flags for ACRs.

00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:43.679
Having an inaccurate
or unclear description

00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:46.520
of the product is a real red flag

00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:48.839
because if someone
doesn't know what their product

00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:52.799
does or can't describe it properly,
then that's a real problem.

00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:55.879
Also, they might know
their product inside and out,

00:15:55.880 --> 00:15:58.119
but if it's just a salesy description,

00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:02.159
then they don't understand
what the purpose of the ACR is.

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:04.143
That's another red flag.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.839
Does the Notes section explicitly say

00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:11.039
that the VPAT does
not cover essential features?

00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:16.500
For example,
I saw an ACR for a video player

00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:22.399
that said captions
are the responsibility of the author,

00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:27.799
and therefore any WCAG references
to captions, it said not applicable.

00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:31.759
The thing is, we need to know
if that video player supports captions,

00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:34.439
and it didn't answer
any of those questions.

00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:37.479
That's something
to really look out for, as well.

00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:43.760
Not dated is a real problem,
and dated over 12 months is something

00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:46.813
that is a bit of a red flag for me.

00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:49.599
The thing is,
if it's dated over 12 months,

00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:53.280
and you're still using the same version,

00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:56.839
then it still could be accurate,
but then my question would be,

00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:58.759
what have they been doing
in the last 12 months?

00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:02.079
Is this product going
to be maintained, et cetera?

00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:05.333
Now, I've been running this presentation,

00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:08.319
or versions of this presentation,
for three or four years.

00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:14.199
I used to say,
in 2021 and 2022 with COVID,

00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:16.159
everyone has kind of got
a bit of a backlog.

00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:23.159
If it's dated 2019, and we're currently
in 2022, then that's okay,

00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:24.679
but that's not the case now.

00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:27.539
I mean, we're almost into 2025 now.

00:17:27.540 --> 00:17:32.360
I still see ACRs dated 2018, 2019.

00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:35.399
They're really, unfortunately,

00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:38.812
not worth the paper
that they're written on.

00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:42.479
They really should be using
the latest version.

00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:45.579
Now, the latest version
of the VPAT is 2.5,

00:17:45.580 --> 00:17:48.059
which was released in November 2023,

00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:52.519
which, of course,
is just under a year ago.

00:17:52.520 --> 00:17:58.039
Now, once again, this is something
to look at if you're using

00:17:58.040 --> 00:18:02.220
the same version as what the ACR covers.

00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:06.653
Really, people should be using 2.5.

00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:11.759
If there's no details of testing
undertaken or generic descriptions,

00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:17.480
like manual testing or automated
testing or screen reader testing,

00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:20.450
then that's another real red flag.

00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:25.399
Other things
is that if they only mention automated

00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:29.199
testing in the evaluation methods,
then that's a problem.

00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:34.992
Automated testing can only identify
about 30% of all accessibility errors.

00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:37.159
If they only did automated testing,

00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:40.760
they're not going to find all the issues.

00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:43.119
The same for screen readers,
as I said before.

00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:45.239
Screen readers are just one element

00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:49.128
of what you need
to make accessible for a product,

00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:52.199
so if they need to mention more of that.

00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:53.599
As I said before,

00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:57.519
no mention of mobile and mobile
assistive technology testing.

00:18:57.520 --> 00:18:59.839
Now, the exception to that is, of course,

00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:03.331
if the product can only be used
on a desktop.

00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:05.519
With our government,
with the Australian government,

00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:10.479
there are some products that are locked
down to a physical environment

00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:13.999
and you're only able to use
them on the desktops provided.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.959
Never is going to be
open on a mobile device.

00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:21.800
In that case, obviously,
that testing doesn't need to be done.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:26.199
Other red flags,
missing or inaccurate contact information.

00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:30.639
It's always a good idea to reach out
to the person in the contact information,

00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:34.480
see how long it takes for them to respond.

00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:39.159
We did some work with a community college
a year and a half ago.

00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:41.999
I reached out to the contact information

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:45.799
on the VPAT during the six months
I did work for them.

00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:51.079
I got a response about
14 months after I emailed them.

00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:52.679
That's not good enough.

00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:57.239
You really need to receive
a response within, I'd say, a week.

00:19:57.240 --> 00:20:00.359
Anything longer
than a week is a real problem.

00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:05.160
I'd really prefer
it to be within one business day.

00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:09.799
Anything that says
not evaluated in Level A or AA

00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:12.919
in those tables is a real problem.

00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:14.279
That means we didn't bother testing it.

00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:16.239
It's applicable, but we don't care.

00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:18.680
That's probably paraphrasing.

00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:22.599
Anything that says
not evaluated is a problem.

00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:25.079
Anything that has one VPAT for multiple

00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:29.040
products is also problematic

00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:33.759
because the VPAT
or the ACR is quite detailed in terms

00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:36.959
of the level of conformance in any issues.

00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:39.853
If it's covering multiple products,

00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:43.839
then it's really an indication
that no real testing

00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:49.079
has been done or at least no documentation
of the testing has been done.

00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:50.399
Then cells without content.

00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:54.479
It's really important that
when you look at an ACR,

00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:58.799
you've got the description
of the WCAG criteria.

00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:01.879
You've got whether it supports
or it doesn't support.

00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:04.239
Then you've got a third cell,

00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:07.969
a third column that is remarks
and explanations.

00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:10.239
That should always be filled out.

00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:13.199
Whether that particular
requirement is supports

00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:16.319
or partially supports or not applicable,

00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:18.599
there should always
be text in that remarks

00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:21.999
and explanations to explain
why it's not applicable,

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:25.079
how you did meet it if it says supports,

00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:29.364
and what doesn't meet
it if it says partially supports.

00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:34.159
If there's terminology
like passes or fails,

00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:39.599
then that's a real red flag
because the terminology is not applicable,

00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:42.327
supports, and partially supports.

00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:46.959
If there's a lot of not applicable,
then that's also a red flag.

00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:50.599
If it says all supports,
then that's also a red flag.

00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:54.419
Now, I do say
that there's certainly products out there

00:21:54.420 --> 00:21:56.159
that are fully accessible.

00:21:56.160 --> 00:22:02.799
I mean, in OzPlayer,
our ACR does say all supports,

00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:06.959
but we have very detailed
explanations for all of those things.

00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:09.599
It is true that there
can be some products out

00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:12.359
there that may have an ACR
where everything

00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:14.879
is accurate and it says supports,

00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:19.199
but we all know the products that we tend
to use on a daily basis,

00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:22.479
whether it be Outlook or WordPress
or whatever,

00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:25.279
tend to have some accessibility issues.

00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:29.799
Those accessibility issues
need to be captured in the ACR.

00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:33.239
It's also because it's
a changing environment.

00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:35.471
Things change all the time.

00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:41.035
Often we do a lot of testing,
and then retesting, and then retesting.

00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:44.019
Our clients often say, "Look,
we're not going to fix this

00:22:44.020 --> 00:22:47.000
until a year or two from now."

00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:51.373
Accessibility can be a long-term process.

00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:54.479
You can't make things
accessible overnight.

00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:59.558
That's understandable,
but that needs to be reflected in the ACR.

00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:05.719
That's what you should look
for in terms of red flags.

00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:08.680
What does a good ACR look like?

00:23:09.187 --> 00:23:13.679
Have explanations under Remarks
and Explanations for each criteria.

00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:16.399
Use conventional wording such as supports,

00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:20.039
partially supports, does not support,
and not applicable,

00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:23.879
and stand up to questioning,
which I'll talk about a bit later.

00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:26.759
It's always a good idea
to have an ACR written

00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:30.013
by someone other than the product vendor.

00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:34.320
That way, in most cases,
it's more accurate.

00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:38.119
It's not necessarily
an attack on the vendors themselves,

00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:43.319
but the vendors are very, very skilled
at building their particular product.

00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:46.079
They're not necessarily
skilled at accessibility.

00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:50.364
Especially if you're dealing
with a very small product,

00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:55.919
then basically it's possible
that there's not a lot of accessibility

00:23:55.920 --> 00:24:00.442
information or knowledge
within the vendor's organization.

00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:06.439
You really need the ACR to be completed

00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:09.760
by someone other than the product vendor.

00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:13.039
An exception
to that might be someone like Microsoft,

00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:16.079
because I know they actually have teams
of accessibility people,

00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:19.439
and there's people
who their entire job is writing ACRs,

00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:23.079
and they're incredibly
skilled in accessibility,

00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:25.559
but that's not often the case.

00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:29.879
It's really a good idea
to make sure to ask or to look

00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:34.319
for an ACR that is written by someone
other than the product vendor,

00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:37.220
preferably an accessibility company.

00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:40.039
It needs to have a clear description
of the product,

00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:45.159
including any associated features,
and refer to the existing accessibility

00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:47.805
tools in the testing undertaken.

00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:53.799
Now that you know the red flags
and what makes a good VPAT,

00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:57.041
let's assess the accuracy of an ACR.

00:24:57.320 --> 00:24:59.987
First read through the ACR.

00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:03.279
Does the ACR contain reference to known

00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:05.719
accessibility issues within the product?

00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:09.290
If you don't know the product,
then Google it.

00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:13.999
There's often information
in the W3C mailing list

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:18.046
or the WebAIM mailing
list about different products.

00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:20.519
Learn what you can about the product,

00:25:20.520 --> 00:25:25.199
and then see if the ACR has
that information included in it.

00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:26.479
Read through the description.

00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:31.716
Does it accurately describe
the product and its essential features?

00:25:32.724 --> 00:25:34.479
Read through the evaluation methods.

00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:36.760
Do they sound reasonable?

00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:39.239
Then look for any not applicables

00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:42.731
for features
that the product definitely has.

00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:48.219
If there are exceptions,
are they reasonable

00:25:48.220 --> 00:25:52.079
or will they block access
to essential functionality?

00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:54.719
You don't want to say, so for WordPress--

00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:58.639
I'm not saying
that the ACR for WordPress says this,

00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:04.919
but as an example, if WordPress says,
"We are not evaluating

00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:09.759
the functionality
of the authoring system,"

00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:12.799
then you'd be like,
well, that's the main part of the product,

00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:15.693
so that really needs to be covered.

00:26:16.482 --> 00:26:20.479
Read through those things,
and then do some testing.

00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:23.519
The easiest thing to test is the keyboard.

00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:25.799
Test the product with the keyboard.

00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:28.079
Just for those people who don't know,

00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:31.519
you use the tab key
to tab between actionable

00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:35.440
elements and shift tab to tab backwards.

00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:39.199
The enter or space key
to activate an element.

00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:41.399
Sometimes if you're on
a menu or something like that,

00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:43.439
you might need to use the arrow key.

00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:45.179
If there's any pop-ups,

00:26:45.180 --> 00:26:48.839
they need to be able to be closed
by using the escape key.

00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:50.317
This is something that you can do.

00:26:50.318 --> 00:26:53.279
It might take you an hour or two to tab

00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:57.599
through and make sure you can fill
out forms, you can watch videos,

00:26:57.600 --> 00:26:58.819
that you can do all the things

00:26:58.820 --> 00:27:00.959
that you need to do on that product.

00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:03.719
If you can't, note them
down because you're going to want

00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:06.447
to talk to the vendor about them.

00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:11.200
The next one to look
at is 2.2.2 Pause, Stop, Hide.

00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:13.919
Is there movement on the site?

00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:18.839
If there is movement,
does it have an accessible pause feature?

00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:22.719
That means it needs to be accessible
to the mouse, keyboard, and touch.

00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:25.240
Or does it stop within five seconds?

00:27:25.241 --> 00:27:30.599
If it does have those features
or it doesn't stop within five seconds,

00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:33.679
is that information included in the ACR?

00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:40.560
Another part of pause, stop,
hide is around autoplay of videos.

00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:46.199
It's important to make sure
videos don't autoplay, but if they do,

00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:49.199
the very first focusable link on the page,

00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:54.760
so when you tab into the page,
needs to be able to pause the video.

00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:59.759
That's something
also that can be tested pretty quickly.

00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:02.959
Then there's 2.4.1 Bypass Blocks.

00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:06.039
Does every page have a skip link,

00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:09.279
and is it the first focusable
link on the page?

00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:13.199
The skip link is like a skip to main
content or skip to the content.

00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:16.840
Often it's only available
via the keyboard.

00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:19.039
You have to tab into the page,

00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:22.800
and it needs to be the first link
that shows up.

00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:28.280
That's a fairly common way
of meeting bypass blocks.

00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:32.959
If there isn't something like that,
then is that included in the ACR?

00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:37.119
Now, the one page
that doesn't need bypass blocks,

00:28:37.120 --> 00:28:40.719
as in a skip-to-content link,
is the home page.

00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:44.039
There's things around ARIA
that you can do,

00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:48.720
but we won't go into any code
in this particular course.

00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:53.816
Error identification.

00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:59.079
Another thing you can do is submit
an empty and/or an incorrect form

00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:03.444
and determine
if the errors are described appropriately.

00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:06.759
If there are errors,
do they have suggestions?

00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:09.319
If not, is that included in the ACR?

00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:14.799
For example, if you're filling out
a form that requires your name

00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:16.559
and your email address

00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:21.079
and you submit it with an empty form,
so no information,

00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:23.519
then the errors should say something like,

00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:27.439
please enter your first name,
for example, Jane,

00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:31.248
or please enter your surname,
for example, Smith.

00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:34.559
The reason why you want
to have that for example thing

00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:39.440
is because sometimes surname
is not the correct terminology.

00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:43.608
I believe in the US it's last
name or family name.

00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:46.039
That sometimes can trip people up.

00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:47.879
Having that suggestion,

00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:52.640
we are all very familiar
with the Jane Doe or John Smith,

00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:56.726
can help people understand
how to fill out the form.

00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:03.119
Then consider doing
a high-level accessibility audit

00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:05.719
if it's really important
for you to determine

00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:08.839
exactly how inaccessible this is,
or if you're doing an EEAAP,

00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:11.650
which I'll talk about in a moment.

00:30:12.920 --> 00:30:16.319
I don't recommend
that you do a full accessibility audit,

00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:21.239
but maybe someone spending
a day or two doing some testing

00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:25.762
can really help you determine
whether the ACR is accurate.

00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:30.439
The other thing
that you could do is user testing

00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:33.879
with people with disabilities
with assistive technologies.

00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:38.279
You ask potential users
who are people with disabilities

00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:41.479
who use their assistive
technology to test it,

00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:45.159
but please remember that these people

00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:48.599
with disabilities have their own jobs,
have their own lives.

00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:51.439
They're not there just to do your testing.

00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:56.759
It's always a good idea
to provide some kind of monetary

00:30:56.760 --> 00:31:01.159
offer or a gift card
or something along those lines,

00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:03.959
or if it's someone
within your organisation

00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:08.562
and you are maybe looking
at lots of VPATs or lots of ACRs,

00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:11.319
allowing it to be added
to their job descriptions

00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:15.239
so they can allow time
to do this kind of testing.

00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:19.479
Now, WCAG doesn't require that you test

00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:22.800
with users using assistive technologies.

00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:28.119
It's not necessary that the ACR says

00:31:28.120 --> 00:31:30.679
that it does
this or that you need to do this,

00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:36.240
but it is a good way of finding
things that really trip people up.

00:31:36.420 --> 00:31:37.639
It is valuable.

00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:42.959
Do remember that
you are basically using people

00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:48.593
with disabilities as expert testers,
and they should be treated as such.

00:31:50.296 --> 00:31:52.559
Third, reach out to the vendor.

00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:56.759
This is where you need to question,
question, question.

00:31:56.760 --> 00:31:58.999
Why is this dated 14 months ago?

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:02.239
Has the product not been updated
in 14 months?

00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:04.439
Why did you say
this section is not applicable

00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:06.599
when the product has this feature?

00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:09.919
What kind of testing did
you do to ensure compliance?

00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:12.959
Why did you decide to fill
out this ACR internally?

00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:17.279
Why does the description omit
essential features of the product?

00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:20.319
Why did you decide to test
with only one screen reader?

00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:22.039
There are a lot of partially supports.

00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:25.159
Do you have a timeline as
to when these issues will be fixed?

00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:28.096
Now, I've been told I'm really harsh.

00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:32.039
The organizations I've worked
with when I'm looking at ACRs

00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:36.245
and writing EEAAPs often
have to rewrite my questions.

00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:40.259
There is a great product
called goblin.tools.

00:32:40.260 --> 00:32:44.400
It's a website which I've been using
a lot recently.

00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:47.639
Basically, you can put
in your text and you can say,

00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:50.080
"Make this text more polite."

00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:56.000
That I found quite makes
my life a lot easier.

00:32:56.280 --> 00:32:59.533
It's up to you how polite you want to be.

00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:02.079
This is the product
that you're paying for.

00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:05.719
This is a product that needs
to be accessible by law.

00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:09.079
If it's not,
then you have every right to question

00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:12.160
as to why that isn't the case.

00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:14.959
What next?

00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:15.979
Okay.

00:33:15.980 --> 00:33:20.840
After that, what you need
to do is develop a timeline.

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:23.959
That's something
you can do with the vendor.

00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:27.292
You can say,
"It's not keyboard accessible.

00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:31.899
The search feature can't be used

00:33:31.900 --> 00:33:35.159
by a screen reader," et cetera, et cetera.

00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:40.680
The vendor says that these things
will be fixed by Quarter 3 2025.

00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:43.679
Also, keeping in contact with them,

00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:48.240
making sure that timeline
is met is also valuable.

00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:53.319
If you can, update the contract to say,
"Hey, we will, if you can,

00:33:53.320 --> 00:33:57.800
withhold payment
if these things are not fixed."

00:33:58.800 --> 00:34:02.639
If you already bought a product,
and you might say,

00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:05.259
well, we won't buy
it again in the next year

00:34:05.260 --> 00:34:08.119
or something
like that if these things aren't fixed.

00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:12.979
That's often, unfortunately,
the best way to get

00:34:12.980 --> 00:34:16.039
a vendor to actually
to improve accessibiliy

00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:20.119
compliance is to threaten
to withhold funds

00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:23.294
or threaten to not purchase the product.

00:34:23.720 --> 00:34:30.000
Then, this is something
for US universities and colleges,

00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:31.579
what's called an EEAAP,

00:34:31.580 --> 00:34:34.439
so an Equally Effective
Alternate Access Plan.

00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:38.359
I actually think it's quite useful
for all organizations.

00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:42.639
Basically, it says, hey,
this particular part of the product,

00:34:42.640 --> 00:34:46.559
say the search feature,
can't be used with a screen reader.

00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:50.599
The alternative is that we provide

00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:53.599
the people that might need
to use this product with access

00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:58.140
to Be My Eyes or Aira
so that they can call

00:34:58.141 --> 00:35:00.759
someone up on their phone
or their computer.

00:35:00.760 --> 00:35:03.159
That person can take over their screen

00:35:03.160 --> 00:35:06.719
and do the search for them
and then tell them what they see.

00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:10.879
For example,
another one where there were articles

00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:12.781
in different languages,

00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:18.199
but those articles
didn't have the correct lang attribute,

00:35:18.200 --> 00:35:20.159
which means that the screen reader

00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:23.334
wouldn't know what language to speak in.

00:35:24.440 --> 00:35:26.559
It might be French,
but it would still think

00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:28.439
that it was all English text.

00:35:28.440 --> 00:35:32.079
Basically, it's not going
to be able to read that properly.

00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:34.399
Then there's a pool of articles.

00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:35.399
You go through and you say,

00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:38.679
these are the 30 articles
that are in those other languages.

00:35:38.680 --> 00:35:41.039
We're going to copy
and paste them into Word.

00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:45.119
We're going to put the right language
elements in the Word document.

00:35:45.120 --> 00:35:46.399
We're going to say to users,

00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:50.719
"If you come across an article
that is in a different language,

00:35:50.720 --> 00:35:55.799
here is the database of Word documents
that you can look at instead."

00:35:55.800 --> 00:36:00.879
There's an alternative solution,
but that's always kind of a backup plan.

00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:06.275
It's always much better for
the system itself to be fully accessible.

00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:09.548
Any questions?

00:36:09.560 --> 00:36:11.400
That's it for me.

00:36:11.920 --> 00:36:14.279
I have a couple of articles
that I want to share with you,

00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:15.759
but please let me know.

00:36:15.760 --> 00:36:17.119
I'll pull them up.

00:36:17.120 --> 00:36:20.611
Please let me know
if you have any questions.

00:36:21.860 --> 00:36:26.560
<v Kelly> Gian, yes,
we have a couple questions in the Q&amp;A.

00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:32.399
Our first one is,
what is the most common thing you see

00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:35.970
that needs fixing
when making sites compliant?

00:36:42.080 --> 00:36:45.480
<v Gian> I would say misuse of ARIA.

00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:51.240
ARIA is for screen readers
to access the content properly.

00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:58.880
Very, very often people, they--

00:37:01.160 --> 00:37:03.479
A little ARIA goes a long way.

00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:05.759
People who are new to accessibility think

00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:09.359
that ARIA is like the answer to everything
without realizing that ARIA

00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:12.999
is only one very small
portion of accessibility.

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:16.332
They'll do some really stupid things like,

00:37:16.440 --> 00:37:18.159
sorry, this is me being harsh again,

00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:22.319
ARIA described by on images
instead of alt attributes.

00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:25.719
We came across one product
where they'd added

00:37:25.720 --> 00:37:28.879
so many ARIA elements
that when it came to the search,

00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:32.688
it was announced five times
to the screen reader.

00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:35.839
It just meant using
the product was basically inaccessible

00:37:35.840 --> 00:37:37.839
because everything,
it wasn't just the search,

00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:42.039
it was everything in that product
was announced five times.

00:37:42.040 --> 00:37:45.372
It just drove our screen
reader user crazy.

00:37:53.200 --> 00:37:54.936
<v Kelly> Unmute myself.

00:37:55.320 --> 00:37:57.138
That was very helpful.

00:37:57.360 --> 00:38:03.240
The next question is related
to running your company is,

00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:06.479
would you be willing
to say a little bit about

00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:11.199
your experience of whatever obstacles,

00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:16.436
systemic obstacles you had to dismantle
to build your own business,

00:38:17.720 --> 00:38:22.920
employing majority
of your employees with disabilities?

00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:31.120
<v Gian> I think

00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:37.239
there is still a huge amount

00:38:37.240 --> 00:38:41.280
of discrimination
against people with disabilities.

00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:45.859
I found it actually in accessibility
conferences a lot as well,

00:38:45.860 --> 00:38:48.796
which doesn't even really make sense.

00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:50.840
For example,

00:38:51.240 --> 00:38:57.039
I went to a presentation
to a community college

00:38:57.040 --> 00:38:59.039
where I went in.

00:38:59.040 --> 00:39:00.599
I had a walker, a rollator,

00:39:00.600 --> 00:39:05.836
because I have a condition that makes
it difficult for me to stand.

00:39:06.200 --> 00:39:09.119
I thought I did a fantastic job.

00:39:09.120 --> 00:39:12.479
I had people afterwards tell
me who were in the session,

00:39:12.480 --> 00:39:14.998
"Oh, it's fantastic,
you're exactly what we need,"

00:39:14.999 --> 00:39:16.279
et cetera, et cetera.

00:39:16.280 --> 00:39:18.319
The higher ups who were there said

00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:23.200
that I wasn't professional enough
because I used a walker.

00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:26.359
It was like, that doesn't even make sense.

00:39:26.360 --> 00:39:28.879
Also, we're working
in this accessibility industry,

00:39:28.880 --> 00:39:32.039
so we should support
people with disabilities.

00:39:32.040 --> 00:39:36.599
I have also seen
it when the people that I hire,

00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:40.879
they are often dismissed more by clients,
not all clients,

00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:44.479
but clients if they have
an obvious disability.

00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:47.639
They are often also assumed
to know only about

00:39:47.640 --> 00:39:51.528
their disability
and not accessibility as a whole.

00:39:52.040 --> 00:39:54.879
Our screen reader tester,
Ralph, is absolutely brilliant,

00:39:54.880 --> 00:39:57.119
does a whole bunch
of accessibility testing,

00:39:57.120 --> 00:39:59.682
not just screen reader testing.

00:39:59.800 --> 00:40:03.839
If he starts talking about
the accessibility of Instagram,

00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:05.279
people just switch off
because they're like,

00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:07.400
well, how would he know?

00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:12.839
Yet I get him to test the accessibility
of Instagram quite regularly.

00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:14.919
I'm not sure if that answers the question,

00:40:14.920 --> 00:40:18.808
but that is definitely
something that I have seen.

00:40:23.680 --> 00:40:25.979
<v Kelly> Sorry that you've
had those experiences

00:40:25.980 --> 00:40:31.017
and that I look forward to all of us
building a world where folks

00:40:31.018 --> 00:40:34.759
don't have to go through that,
what you've been through.

00:40:34.760 --> 00:40:38.559
<v Gian> It just amazes me,
actually, that it still happens.

00:40:38.560 --> 00:40:39.919
Especially in this industry,

00:40:39.920 --> 00:40:43.490
it's just amazing to me
that it still happens.

00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:51.119
<v Kelly> One other question here about,
I'd love to ask if you would be willing

00:40:51.120 --> 00:40:56.879
to expand on some ways
that folks can think about

00:40:56.880 --> 00:41:00.199
the accessibility of content for people

00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:04.484
with intellectual disability
and ways to evaluate that?

00:41:05.040 --> 00:41:08.199
<v Gian> That's actually people
with intellectual disabilities,

00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:10.559
people with cognitive
disabilities as a whole,

00:41:10.560 --> 00:41:16.193
often have been left behind when it comes
to the accessibility industry.

00:41:17.140 --> 00:41:22.680
WCAG 3 or WCAG
Silver should improve on that.

00:41:22.960 --> 00:41:24.959
Actually, when WCAG 2 was released,

00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:30.679
it was released with a caveat that said
that meeting WCAG 2 requirements

00:41:30.680 --> 00:41:32.359
would not be enough to make your site

00:41:32.360 --> 00:41:34.599
accessible to cognitive disabilities.

00:41:34.600 --> 00:41:38.639
That was due to a letter that was written
by Lisa Seaman,

00:41:38.640 --> 00:41:41.159
who was on the working group, and cosigned

00:41:41.160 --> 00:41:43.859
by a bunch of us
because we were so concerned

00:41:43.860 --> 00:41:45.639
that there was so little.

00:41:45.640 --> 00:41:47.919
With regards to accessibility for people

00:41:47.920 --> 00:41:50.499
with cognitive disabilities in WCAG,

00:41:50.500 --> 00:41:53.279
it is there, but it's all at Level AAA.

00:41:53.280 --> 00:41:57.499
As I say, Level AAA
is where success criterion go to die.

00:41:57.500 --> 00:41:59.480
It often gets ignored.

00:42:00.240 --> 00:42:03.334
There's this thing called easy English,

00:42:03.600 --> 00:42:07.199
which is fantastic for people
with intellectual disabilities.

00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:11.999
It's also important to know
that people with cognitive disabilities,

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:14.879
it's not always an IQ problem.

00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:17.520
It's often a reading problem.

00:42:18.240 --> 00:42:20.819
These people might find
it really, really difficult

00:42:20.820 --> 00:42:23.039
to read a paragraph of text,

00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:25.599
but have no problem if it's read to them.

00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:26.559
I'm the exact opposite.

00:42:26.560 --> 00:42:28.199
If I read something, I can remember it.

00:42:28.200 --> 00:42:31.612
If it's said to me,
I forget it immediately.

00:42:32.720 --> 00:42:35.359
Those people can use screen readers.

00:42:35.360 --> 00:42:37.719
Making sure that screen
readers are actually accessible

00:42:37.720 --> 00:42:39.599
for people with cognitive disabilities,

00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:42.519
as well as people who use screen readers.

00:42:42.520 --> 00:42:45.852
The other thing
is that there's always been

00:42:47.520 --> 00:42:49.399
a concept in the accessibility industry

00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:53.279
that a text-only site
is the fully accessible website.

00:42:53.280 --> 00:42:55.559
That is absolutely not the case.

00:42:55.560 --> 00:42:58.519
There's a lot of kind of theories
that if you remove

00:42:58.520 --> 00:43:00.039
a whole lot of things from your website,

00:43:00.040 --> 00:43:03.759
it's going to be more accessible,
and that's not the case.

00:43:03.760 --> 00:43:06.200
Having imagery, having icons,

00:43:06.360 --> 00:43:10.880
one icon to represent
each section of your site.

00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:17.439
I remember at Monash University,
each faculty had a different colour.

00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:20.519
The menu, the header
was all the same colour

00:43:20.520 --> 00:43:21.959
when you're in that section.

00:43:21.960 --> 00:43:25.679
Those are the kind of things
that you can do to help

00:43:25.680 --> 00:43:28.573
people with cognitive disabilities.

00:43:33.080 --> 00:43:36.019
<v Kelly> Thank you for that.
That's very helpful.

00:43:36.020 --> 00:43:40.640
All right. I see no further
questions in our Q&amp;A.

00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:43.559
We do have just a couple minutes left.

00:43:43.560 --> 00:43:48.319
Do you have any closing thoughts
that you want to share with our audience?

00:43:48.320 --> 00:43:49.099
<v Gian> Yes.

00:43:49.100 --> 00:43:51.359
I wrote this article
a couple of years ago.

00:43:51.360 --> 00:43:56.517
It's called The Five Stages of Grief,
AKA Accepting Accessibility.

00:43:57.240 --> 00:44:02.799
Basically, it's denial, anger,
bargaining, depression, acceptance,

00:44:02.800 --> 00:44:06.760
in terms of how vendors
respond when you say,

00:44:06.818 --> 00:44:08.119
"Hey, you need to be accessible."

00:44:08.120 --> 00:44:10.840
I'm putting it into the chat.

00:44:10.960 --> 00:44:13.079
That's definitely,
if you have been dealing

00:44:13.080 --> 00:44:14.879
with a lot of vendors,

00:44:14.880 --> 00:44:18.179
hopefully it will make you laugh
and make you feel

00:44:18.180 --> 00:44:20.399
a little bit better that you're not alone.

00:44:20.400 --> 00:44:25.737
There's also an article back
in 2019 called How to Read a VPAT,

00:44:26.080 --> 00:44:31.760
which is similar to what I've talked
about today.

00:44:33.800 --> 00:44:36.519
I've got these things
called the CCC developer

00:44:36.520 --> 00:44:42.599
videos on HTML forms and the dreaded ARIA,
what is ARIA, and why use it,

00:44:42.600 --> 00:44:46.319
how not to use it, et cetera,
aimed at developers.

00:44:46.320 --> 00:44:48.799
That I'm also putting in the chat.

00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:52.559
The other thing
that might be helpful are these things

00:44:52.560 --> 00:44:54.320
called fact sheets.

00:44:54.600 --> 00:44:59.439
We have fact sheets on images, PDF,
video, interactive maps, HTML5,

00:44:59.440 --> 00:45:02.008
content, JavaScript, tables, coding,

00:45:02.009 --> 00:45:05.262
keyboard, source order forms, and mobile.

00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:10.220
Each section has,
just put it in the chat again,

00:45:11.340 --> 00:45:13.099
we have principles.

00:45:13.100 --> 00:45:15.159
Why would you want to meet these things?

00:45:15.160 --> 00:45:19.319
Impact on users as to what happens
if you don't meet those things.

00:45:19.320 --> 00:45:21.119
It's a developer checklist,

00:45:21.120 --> 00:45:24.439
and it has actual correct
and incorrect code,

00:45:24.440 --> 00:45:25.759
and a manager checklist,

00:45:25.760 --> 00:45:28.879
which is basically like
a testing checklist.

00:45:28.880 --> 00:45:31.639
The automated testing
tools in the WCAG guidelines,

00:45:31.640 --> 00:45:32.839
they're a bit out of date.

00:45:32.840 --> 00:45:35.485
I need to remove them, actually.

00:45:35.800 --> 00:45:37.679
Those sections are still applicable.

00:45:37.680 --> 00:45:39.239
Now, they're about WCAG 2.

00:45:39.240 --> 00:45:42.179
They're not about 2.1 or 2.2.

00:45:42.180 --> 00:45:45.119
Those things will hopefully help people

00:45:45.120 --> 00:45:48.690
who are trying to learn
more about this stuff.

00:45:50.300 --> 00:45:52.679
<v Kelly> All right.
Amazing group of resources.

00:45:52.680 --> 00:45:55.242
They're at the end in the chat.

00:45:55.320 --> 00:45:57.099
Really informative presentation.

00:45:57.100 --> 00:45:58.739
Dynamically presented.

00:45:58.740 --> 00:46:03.240
