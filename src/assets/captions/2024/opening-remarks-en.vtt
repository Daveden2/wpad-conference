00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.799
Bet: Good morning,
good afternoon, good evening,

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.119
wherever you are in the world.

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:26.532
Welcome to WordPress
Accessibility Day 2024.

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.319
My name is Bet Hannon,

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.079
and I'm one of the lead organizers
of this event.

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.519
This is the third year
that I've had the honor of being

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.319
able to help with the organizing team.

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.119
I am really excited for this year's event.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.919
We have some great speakers
from all over the world for you,

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.565
and we're glad that you're here.

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.879
Let me start off by explaining

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.839
a little bit about
WordPress Accessibility Day,

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.079
share some thank yous,
and give you a little info about

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.980
what to expect in the next 24 hours.

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.119
WordPress Accessibility Day was created

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.599
in 2020 when Joe Dolson and several others

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.319
from the WordPress Accessibility team
held the very first event,

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.159
and the idea was 24 hours
of free online accessibility

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:17.319
education that anyone anywhere
in the world can have access to.

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.679
There's a lot
of great accessibility training

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.859
that happens
in the US and the EU regularly,

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.819
but there are parts
of the world where it's difficult

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:26.879
to find accessibility training,

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.759
especially during normal waking hours,
and it can be costly.

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:33.074
They wanted to address that,

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.075
and we've continued
to address that in these events.

00:01:36.076 --> 00:01:39.079
In 2022, WordPress
Accessibility Day was created

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.199
as an independent event,
separate from the WordPress Foundation,

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.399
and through a partnership with Knowbility,

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.700
we've gained recognition
as a 501(c)3 US nonprofit.

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.239
This year is even bigger and more global.

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.259
As of just an hour ago,

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:00.780
we have 2,266 people registered to attend

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.066
from 79 countries all over the world.

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:09.759
We've also grown the number of speaker
applications year over year,

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:13.999
and both the number and the quality
of these applications

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.639
made selecting
this year's speakers really difficult,

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.239
but I'm excited that we
have a variety of speakers

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:25.000
over the next 24 hours for you.

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.079
We have speakers
from 12 different countries.

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.642
That's one more than last year.

00:02:30.645 --> 00:02:34.839
Four people are first-time
speakers for any event,

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.519
not just WordPress Accessibility Day.

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:41.399
We have great gender balance,
including 7% who identify

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.080
as non-binary and 17%
who identify as LGBTQ.

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.392
36% of our speakers identify as non-white,

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:55.875
and 24% of our speakers identify
as someone living with a disability.

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.479
These folks will be bringing you talks

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:03.359
that will have something for everyone,
from beginners to advanced,

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.920
for devs and designers
and content creators, and more.

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.759
I'm really proud of our organizing
team this year.

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.319
We have had nearly 30 organizers
that have been working

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:20.079
together over the last year
to bring you this event,

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.919
and beyond the organizers,

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.839
over 20 additional people
are serving as volunteers today,

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.959
doing things like managing
technology and emceeing sessions.

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:33.439
All of this is a labor of love
to make accessibility

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.360
education more available to more people.

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.359
I want to give a special thanks
to Amber Hinds and Joe Dolson,

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.199
my co-lead organizers.

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.612
It really is a joy to work
with both of you.

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.879
We have had some amazing folks leading

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:53.116
various teams of the organizers this year.

00:03:53.117 --> 00:03:55.927
Adrienne Grace has led volunteers.

00:03:56.259 --> 00:04:00.239
Isla Waite has led technology and vendors.

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:04.079
Ryan Bracey has led the speakers' team,
Ricky Onsman

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:08.260
has been the lead for our
new Asia-Pacific team,

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:12.660
and Richard Gauder
and Sol Escobar are our co-leads

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:14.683
for the post-event team.

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:20.359
I especially want to mention two people,
however, and their teams.

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:23.679
One of the things that we've worked
really hard on in this last

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.759
year is improving
the marketing for this event.

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.159
Attendees can't sign up to attend

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.599
if they don't even know
that the event exists.

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:36.799
Michelle Frechette early on agreed
to lead our marketing team.

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.839
Michelle and her team
of six coordinated to get WordPress

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:46.199
Accessibility Day organizers
on 11 different podcasts and shows

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:49.279
in the last few weeks,
and they coordinated

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:52.399
a way more sophisticated
social media strategy

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:54.999
than we have had
the capacity to do before.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.959
So special thanks to Michelle and everyone

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:01.372
that's been helping
with the marketing team.

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:05.039
Since one of our goals
is to make accessibility

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:09.359
education more available globally,
we want to make sure

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:12.559
that as many of our presentations
as possible,

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:15.719
which all happen in English,
get translated,

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:18.539
at least the transcripts translated
into other languages

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:21.119
so we can make them more available.

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:24.439
In February, Joni Halabi
showed up at an interest meeting

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:30.479
for potential organizers and that day
began leading our new translations team.

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:35.879
In the last eight months,
Joni has set up internal processes for us,

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:39.319
gathered together volunteers,
and they now have completed

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:42.719
or have in process
more than 30 translations

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:46.759
of previous presentations
in 11 different languages.

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:49.919
They've focused
on the 2023 presentations first.

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:53.159
They'll move on to 2024 next,
and as they have capacity,

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:55.039
they'll work on past years.

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:59.399
We are really celebrating this way
that we can extend our reach

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:03.605
globally so thanks
to Joni and her team of volunteers.

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:08.239
By the way, we're still looking
for translator volunteers.

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:10.679
If you could do this
on this year's website,

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:12.439
you'll look under the community item

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:16.799
in the menu on the website and you'll see
a link for "help translate",

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:18.939
which will take
you to the information page

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:21.239
with an application form.

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:23.879
We are prioritizing translations

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:27.559
into Spanish and French
since these two languages

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:31.080
are spoken in many places
around the world.

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:33.839
I'm pleased to make
a special announcement today

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:36.099
that through the generosity
of our sponsors

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:41.279
and donors, we are now offering
payments for folks who are able to help us

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:44.839
translate presentations
into Spanish and French.

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:49.759
Simply use that same volunteer
form and indicate your interest.

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:53.359
If you're looking for the translations
that have been completed,

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:56.639
just find a link to a past
Accessibility Day event,

00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:59.159
though some of them
are on that help translate page,

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:01.879
and from that schedule
of the page of the event,

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:03.799
click into a specific talk.

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:05.879
At the top of the transcription section,

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:09.371
you'll see the toggle to select
the language.

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:16.080
We are already starting to think
about WordPress Accessibility Day 2025,

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:20.879
and if you'd like to join us
on the organizing team or be a volunteer,

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:22.079
please let us know.

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:23.399
There's an interest form

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:27.526
on the bottom of
the organizers' page of the website.

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:32.919
This event would not be possible
without our sponsors.

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:37.119
We want to give a special thanks
to our platinum sponsors this year;

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:42.599
20i, Equalize Digital, and WP Engine,
and our gold sponsors;

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:46.059
GoDaddy, Grackle Docs, Gravity Forms,

00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:50.160
GreenGeeks Hosting, TGPI, and Yoast.

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:54.959
Thanks also to our silver, bronze,
and micro sponsors as well.

00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:58.999
You will want to visit the sponsor pages
of the website throughout

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.199
the day to learn
a little bit about our sponsors,

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:04.559
but also to get the swag
that they're offering, because of course,

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:07.119
what's a conference without some swag?

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:10.439
They are also giving
away some amazing things.

00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:11.879
There's some good stuff there.

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:16.640
Check out those sponsor pages
for the swag and the giveaways.

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:19.439
Thanks to the generosity
of our sponsors and donors,

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:23.699
the accessibility at this event
will include live captions

00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:25.919
being typed by a certified captioner.

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:28.879
That's happening as I'm speaking.

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:32.212
American Sign Language,
ASL interpretation.

00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:35.279
The ASL and captions can be positioned

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:38.279
and resized to fit
your needs or preferences.

00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:41.959
Everyone can control
how large the slides or the shared screen

00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:44.279
is versus the speaker video,

00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:47.399
and all of these presentations
will be recorded

00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:50.519
and published later with their captions,

00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:53.773
the ASL, and professional transcriptions.

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:56.279
If you need any additional information

00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:58.879
or help with accessibility for the event,

00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:03.878
please see the FAQ on the website or join
the Slack to get help.

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:06.719
Our sponsors and donors also help us

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:09.399
cover the cost of paying for Zoom webinars

00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:13.319
and other software
that's a part of this year-round cost

00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:15.386
of putting on this event.

00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:18.479
Because of the generosity
of our sponsors and donors,

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:20.599
we've been able to increase our donation

00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:23.880
to Knowbility this year to $2,800.

00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:27.239
So thanks, everyone,
for your generosity in helping

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:30.360
to support WordPress Accessibility Day.

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:35.639
Finally, I want to thank all
of you who are attending today.

00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:40.239
Thanks for your commitment to continuing
to learn about accessibility,

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:43.279
no matter what
your experience level, and thanks

00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:45.999
for all the work that you do all year
round in making

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.199
the internet a better place
for people with disabilities.

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:50.279
We're glad you're here.

00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:52.098
Thanks for being here.

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:54.759
We hope you have a great time interacting

00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:57.839
with the other attendees in the Zoom chat.

00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:02.639
You can also join our Slack community
in a special participants' channel.

00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:06.159
If you'd like to do that and continue
some of those conversations,

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:08.119
our session moderators will be posting

00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:11.849
into the Zoom chat about
how you can join Slack.

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:14.119
I'm going to sign off here for a bit.

00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:16.899
The Zoom chat
will still be open and available,

00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:18.899
but we'll be back at the top of the hour

00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:21.359
with our keynote from Lainey Feingold.

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:23.799
Accessibility is a Civil Right:

00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:27.679
The Digital Accessibility Legal Landscape
for the WordPress Community.

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:30.800
You will not want to miss this talk.

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:34.439
Again, thanks for being here
and have a great WordPress

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:36.840
Accessibility Day 2024.

00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:45.719
Speaker 2: Thank you to WordPress
Accessibility Day 2024 sponsors.

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:47.538
Platinum sponsor, 20i.

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:49.319
Easily build, deploy,

00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:53.399
and manage all your projects
with 20i-managed WordPress hosting.

00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:55.759
One UI for all your servers, apps,

00:10:55.760 --> 00:11:00.079
sites, databases,
security, DNS, and email.

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:02.199
Perfect for agencies, e-commerce,

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:06.484
