00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.625
This presentation
was recorded October 2024.

00:00:18.256 --> 00:00:19.545
<v Jessica Sams> Excellent.

00:00:20.865 --> 00:00:24.705

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.799
I'm going to introduce Christina Workman.

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.179
Nice to see you.

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.440
<v Christina Workman> Good to see you, too.

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:09.974
Thanks for having me.

00:01:10.446 --> 00:01:11.542
<v Jessica Sams> All right.

00:01:11.849 --> 00:01:17.219
I guess I'll go ahead
and tell the team about you.

00:01:18.989 --> 00:01:21.510
Christina Workman is
a Frontend Technical Manager

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:26.220
at Americaneagle.com
who values collaboration,

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:28.469
knowledge sharing, and community.

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.538
She has a knack for translating tech talk
into everyday English and a passion

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:37.049
for fostering
awareness of web accessibility.

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:39.959
A self-proclaimed purple-ophile.

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.648
Christina also enjoys
a nice mug of tea while watching

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.579
British Murder Mysteries
and snuggling her two adorable dogs.

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.619
Go ahead and take it away,

00:01:50.489 --> 00:01:52.286
Christina.
<v Christina Workman> All righty.

00:01:53.411 --> 00:01:55.958
<v Jessica Sams> Yes, I see your slides.

00:01:55.959 --> 00:01:57.641
<v Christina Workman> All right.

00:01:57.642 --> 00:01:59.940
All good.
Hello again, everybody.

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.259
My name is Christina Workman,
and I am excited to talk to you

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:08.728
about navigating neurodisabilities,
creating websites with inclusivity

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.589
in mind. If you need to or want
to follow along with the slides

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.009
and haven't grabbed them
from the event site yet,

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:26.314
you can grab them there or also
at christinaworkman.ca/wpad2024.

00:02:26.639 --> 00:02:30.429
That's my name, C-H-R-I-S-T-I-N-A,

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:37.647
W-O-R-K-M-A-N
dot C-A slash W-P-A-D-2-0-2-4.

00:02:39.658 --> 00:02:41.380
A little bit about me.

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.387
I am a Frontend Technical Manager
at Americaneagle.com,

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:51.030
and that's our eagle logo
there on the slide as well.

00:02:51.869 --> 00:02:54.389
I've been there for about two
and a half years,

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.369
and it's been,

00:02:56.399 --> 00:02:58.320
I just have to say,
a really great company,

00:02:58.469 --> 00:03:03.238
and it has helped me a lot, learning
more and more accessibility tips

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:04.239
and tricks.

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:08.368
I live in Calgary, Alberta,
Canada, and I like to relax

00:03:08.369 --> 00:03:10.829
with British Murder Mysteries
and a giant cup of tea,

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.729
my pups, and anything slothy.

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:18.989
That is my favorite little animal
right now.

00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:27.449
A little bit about me and accessibility
and why this particular subject

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:29.182
is important to me.

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:34.260
As I mentioned about learning
at Americaneagle more about accessibility,

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:38.339
I started my learning journey
in the area of accessibility

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.962
about six years ago.

00:03:41.969 --> 00:03:46.139
As I'm sure are also aware,
constantly learning,

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:47.640
there's always new things to learn.

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:54.090
Really always looking forward
to carrying on that journey of learning.

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.749
Myself, I have increasingly poor eyesight.

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:03.900
These glasses have now been upgraded
to progressives or modern-day bifocals,

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:09.090
but I still find myself lifting
my glasses up to read things,

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:12.702
hold things close to my face,
and read them.

00:04:13.499 --> 00:04:16.212
I also experience
frequent temporary disabilities.

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:22.228
Not so much related to websites,
but I have had so many broken bones

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:24.359
in the last few years, I've lost track.

00:04:25.619 --> 00:04:27.119
Then I also get migraines

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.472
fairly frequently.

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:32.009
One of the downfalls of living
in Calgary, actually,

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:36.420
I think it's the migraine capital
of Canada.

00:04:37.739 --> 00:04:40.050
That affects me frequently as well.

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:44.400
I come from, or I belong to rather,

00:04:45.239 --> 00:04:50.100
what I like to call a neuro-fun family,
where we're all neurodivergent

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:51.810
in some flavor or another,

00:04:52.319 --> 00:04:56.399
and it helps keep things interesting,
but it definitely has made me more

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:02.852
and more aware of how websites can impact
somebody's ability to use them.

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:08.771
Our agenda for this talk,
we'll start off with what

00:05:08.772 --> 00:05:12.270
are neurological disabilities,
talk a little bit about that,

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:16.259
and then go into some of the types
of neurological disabilities,

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:21.330
keeping in mind that this
is by no means anywhere near

00:05:21.359 --> 00:05:23.759
a complete list
of neurological disabilities.

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:27.840
The ones we're going to talk
about in a bit of detail are

00:05:27.899 --> 00:05:30.509
the more permanent disabilities.

00:05:30.899 --> 00:05:36.210
Again, remembering that you can have
situational or temporary disabilities

00:05:36.269 --> 00:05:39.719
with neurological
or neurodisabilities as well.

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:42.898
Then we'll go
through some real-life examples and get

00:05:42.899 --> 00:05:45.599
some website tips on what to do
and what not to do

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:51.301
to make your site easier for people
with neurodisabilities to navigate.

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:58.901
First up, what are neurodisabilities?

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:02.129
Besides being a really long word,
hard to pronounce sometimes.

00:06:03.779 --> 00:06:09.179
Neurodisabilities are disorders
or disabilities that affect

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:10.210
the nervous system.

00:06:10.409 --> 00:06:14.429
That covers the brain, nerves,
and the spinal cord.

00:06:14.939 --> 00:06:18.389
It's a pretty complex system,
so you can imagine,

00:06:18.479 --> 00:06:21.989
as I mentioned, there are
a lot of different types of disabilities

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:23.969
and disorders that this covers.

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:28.349
All of these are important
to be considering when you're building

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:29.591
your website.

00:06:30.509 --> 00:06:32.639
If anybody's curious
about the image on here,

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:36.239
it might be a little bit hard
to see just because of the pastel colors,

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:41.489
but it's not quite a watercolor,
but it's an image of a brain,

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:44.191
including the brainstem and all of that.

00:06:49.921 --> 00:06:53.249
I just wanted to talk
about some terminology briefly

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:55.139
before we get into things too far.

00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:59.878
The first one is neurodisability,

00:06:59.879 --> 00:07:03.977
neurological disability versus
cognitive disability.

00:07:05.609 --> 00:07:12.508
I've heard feedback that some people
aren't keen on the word neurodisability

00:07:12.509 --> 00:07:13.679
and prefer cognitive.

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:17.698
I know that that also can happen
the opposite way.

00:07:17.699 --> 00:07:20.729
I know this happens
in a lot of different communities

00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:24.659
where there's a preferred term to use.

00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:30.778
I looked up to get more information
and found that neurodisability is more

00:07:30.779 --> 00:07:34.590
of an all-encompassing term
that includes cognitive disabilities,

00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:39.268
but cognitive refers more specifically
to processes of the brain,

00:07:39.269 --> 00:07:44.279
like memory, speech,
and problem solving.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.900
To keep things consistent
throughout this presentation,

00:07:48.959 --> 00:07:51.406
I'm going to stick to neurodisabilities

00:07:51.407 --> 00:07:55.169
because it really is all
of these different types of disabilities

00:07:55.170 --> 00:07:58.025
that can affect the things
that I'm talking about.

00:07:58.769 --> 00:08:04.980
The other terms that I wanted
to discuss is the word disability versus

00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:08.189
a difference or any other type of word.

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:09.755
I know that there are,

00:08:10.109 --> 00:08:17.849
again, some people
who don't necessarily look at how they are

00:08:17.939 --> 00:08:21.605
in some of the terms.
For example, to take one in particular,

00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:25.140
autistic people, I know from

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:28.408
being involved in that community
that there's a lot of people

00:08:28.409 --> 00:08:32.429
who don't like using the word disability
when talking about autism

00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:37.115
because they don't feel like
it's a disability necessarily

00:08:37.799 --> 00:08:40.324
or that it's a disorder.

00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:44.609
It's more of a difference
in the way the brain works.

00:08:45.779 --> 00:08:46.779
Again,

00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:52.529
completely want to respect that,
but also recognizing that while

00:08:52.530 --> 00:08:55.858
that is a difference,
when you're in the minority group

00:08:55.859 --> 00:08:56.859
with the difference,

00:08:57.089 --> 00:09:00.030
how you perceive
and interact with the world,

00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:02.857
you can encounter disabilities

00:09:03.389 --> 00:09:08.805
as opposed to not being part
of the bigger majority.

00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:11.908
I just want to make sure,

00:09:11.909 --> 00:09:13.738
I mean, I know we're talking
about accessibility,

00:09:13.739 --> 00:09:17.571
but I don't want
to accidentally offend anybody.

00:09:21.089 --> 00:09:26.107
Again, talked a little bit about this,
but why I care about neurodisabilities.

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:31.439
Family history, like I said,
in my family, my son,

00:09:31.799 --> 00:09:34.925
and he gives me permission
to talk about him.

00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:39.388
He has officially been diagnosed with four
of the different types of disabilities

00:09:39.389 --> 00:09:41.159
that we're going to be discussing.

00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:45.990
Those disabilities have had
a huge impact on his life.

00:09:46.979 --> 00:09:50.819
If you were to meet him on the street,
you wouldn't look at him and go,

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:52.860
"Oh, he has disabilities."

00:09:54.029 --> 00:09:56.578
Even if you were to hang out with him
for an afternoon,

00:09:56.579 --> 00:10:00.253
you still might not think
that he has any disabilities.

00:10:00.254 --> 00:10:01.410
I guarantee you,

00:10:01.709 --> 00:10:07.289
as his mother, I have seen he has
struggles with various different things.

00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:09.569
His disabilities are real,

00:10:10.859 --> 00:10:14.763
but there's some people
who have even said to me,

00:10:14.764 --> 00:10:17.609
"Oh, he's just a kid,
he'll grow out of that."

00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:21.008
He's not a kid anymore.
He has not grown out of it.

00:10:21.009 --> 00:10:23.134
He will not grow out of it.

00:10:23.709 --> 00:10:28.501
Again, this is just one of those things
that has really impacted my life.

00:10:30.504 --> 00:10:35.349
I just see how it affects
websites in general,

00:10:35.350 --> 00:10:36.670
as well as I'm working with them.

00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:39.759
Also, we've got the prevalence
in the tech industry.

00:10:40.899 --> 00:10:45.700
There are a lot of people
who work in our industry,

00:10:45.730 --> 00:10:50.199
whether it's by fluke
or whichever studies you want to quote,

00:10:50.590 --> 00:10:54.249
but we do have
a fairly high prevalence of things

00:10:54.250 --> 00:10:56.499
like ADHD and autism

00:10:57.910 --> 00:11:01.914
and other various neurodisabilities
in our industry.

00:11:02.948 --> 00:11:07.540
Again, it's close to home,
something that I witness

00:11:07.569 --> 00:11:10.030
every day in my colleagues and my family.

00:11:10.809 --> 00:11:16.478
Then the last thing is in my six
or so years of learning

00:11:16.479 --> 00:11:17.740
about accessibility,

00:11:17.769 --> 00:11:20.389
working on accessibility remediation,

00:11:21.609 --> 00:11:30.518
I found that it's harder
to call out some of the issues that we see

00:11:30.519 --> 00:11:33.099
on websites
because it's less quantifiable.

00:11:34.210 --> 00:11:40.330
You don't get a lot of things
coming through on automated tests,

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:45.249
which we know don't show
all of the issues on a site,

00:11:45.759 --> 00:11:48.039
but even within the fraction
that they do show,

00:11:48.219 --> 00:11:54.099
it's not so often
the neurodisability issues that they find.

00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:58.720
It's usually various other ones
that are more easy to catch.

00:12:00.669 --> 00:12:01.689
That's, again,

00:12:01.690 --> 00:12:05.197
a little bit about me and why this
is really important to me.

00:12:09.727 --> 00:12:11.525
Neurodisabilities,

00:12:11.526 --> 00:12:16.106
I like to think of as the Linux OS
of the accessibility world.

00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:21.730
I like to think if Family Feud
did one of their top 10 surveys,

00:12:23.079 --> 00:12:27.609
probably not top 10, but it said,
we asked a hundred people,

00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:30.743
what operating system
does your computer use?

00:12:31.299 --> 00:12:34.989
You're going to see a lot of PCs
and Macs, and there'll be

00:12:34.990 --> 00:12:36.699
a nice little group of Linux there.

00:12:37.450 --> 00:12:40.300
Again, mostly tech people probably,

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:43.809
but those top two answers
are going to be PC,

00:12:43.810 --> 00:12:45.339
Windows, and Mac.

00:12:47.319 --> 00:12:50.379
If you did a similar survey
about disabilities,

00:12:51.009 --> 00:12:55.390
you're going to see
a lot more of, if you ask people,

00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:58.478
what do we need to consider
for website accessibility?

00:12:58.479 --> 00:13:00.608
You're going to see some more answers.

00:13:00.609 --> 00:13:04.269
There'll be more than two main ones,
but the minority answer

00:13:04.810 --> 00:13:08.026
from what I found
is neurological disabilities.

00:13:15.010 --> 00:13:18.219
When I talk about that and say like,
most of the time you're going to get

00:13:18.369 --> 00:13:20.889
these other answers and not
so much the neurodisabilities,

00:13:20.919 --> 00:13:23.230
you can look and see for yourself.

00:13:23.259 --> 00:13:27.186
If you were to Google or use
whatever other search engine you wanted

00:13:27.187 --> 00:13:31.449
to use and search up online tips
or just tips for accessibility fixes

00:13:31.690 --> 00:13:32.690
for websites,

00:13:33.070 --> 00:13:36.580
your usual search results are going
to be for visual disabilities,

00:13:36.670 --> 00:13:39.250
physical disabilities,
and audio disabilities.

00:13:39.849 --> 00:13:43.479
Those things like alt text,
color contrast,

00:13:43.540 --> 00:13:44.619
font sizes,

00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:46.299
keyboard navigation,

00:13:47.229 --> 00:13:48.490
all important things,

00:13:48.850 --> 00:13:52.988
but it's a lot less likely
that you're going to see

00:13:52.989 --> 00:13:56.037
on a top 10 list something
to do with neurodisability.

00:13:58.347 --> 00:13:59.529
As I mentioned,

00:14:00.249 --> 00:14:02.470
neurological disabilities
are often overlooked

00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:04.407
and also under-considered.

00:14:05.229 --> 00:14:08.230
They're not usually accommodated
with overlay plugins.

00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:10.959
Some of them are, if you have,

00:14:11.290 --> 00:14:15.668
say, dyslexia, there's, I know,

00:14:15.669 --> 00:14:18.968
some different settings for that,
but a lot of them are not something

00:14:18.969 --> 00:14:21.249
that can be accommodated
with an overlay plugin.

00:14:22.569 --> 00:14:25.809
Then they actually affect
a larger population than you might expect,

00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:30.639
again, particularly in the tech community,
but when we talk about the fact

00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:33.669
that there are
temporary and situational disabilities

00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:35.410
too, at some point,

00:14:35.993 --> 00:14:39.308
I really find it hard
to believe that there is anybody

00:14:39.309 --> 00:14:43.149
who has never experienced
a neurological disability before.

00:14:46.330 --> 00:14:49.058
Hopefully, by the end of this talk,
you'll have a little bit more

00:14:49.059 --> 00:14:53.949
of an appreciation for how people visiting
your site every day may be using it well,

00:14:54.549 --> 00:14:56.682
or conversely struggling with it.

00:15:00.432 --> 00:15:03.681
All right, so let's talk
about some actual neurodisabilities.

00:15:03.682 --> 00:15:08.259
Again, please note, these are
by no means a complete list.

00:15:08.559 --> 00:15:11.110
These are also brief, generalized.

00:15:11.139 --> 00:15:12.670
They're not a complete description.

00:15:12.730 --> 00:15:16.749
This is more to do with focusing
on elements that are relative

00:15:16.750 --> 00:15:19.089
to interacting with websites.

00:15:20.559 --> 00:15:21.559
First up,

00:15:22.029 --> 00:15:25.420
ADHD,
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.

00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:28.509
This impacts part of the brain
that helps us plan,

00:15:28.569 --> 00:15:31.299
focus on, and execute tasks.

00:15:31.985 --> 00:15:36.220
Somebody with ADHD may have
difficulty focusing.

00:15:36.609 --> 00:15:38.470
They might be easily distracted.

00:15:38.859 --> 00:15:41.259
Those two things
are actually not the same.

00:15:42.519 --> 00:15:46.118
They may have short-term memory issues,
and they may have difficulty

00:15:46.119 --> 00:15:47.230
making decisions.

00:15:49.030 --> 00:15:50.109
All of these things

00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:52.690
could come into play
when they're using a website.

00:15:55.899 --> 00:15:56.919
Here I've got

00:15:58.329 --> 00:15:59.979
a picture of a little boy who's

00:16:00.850 --> 00:16:02.770
a fork in the path.

00:16:03.159 --> 00:16:05.769
He could go this way or that way
trying to make a decision,

00:16:06.099 --> 00:16:11.708
trying to represent that difficulty
making decisions aspect.

00:16:13.689 --> 00:16:14.689
Next up,

00:16:15.159 --> 00:16:18.707
autism, which I've briefly touched
upon already.

00:16:18.708 --> 00:16:22.808
This is a group of conditions
that can cause social communication

00:16:22.809 --> 00:16:24.758
and behavioral challenges.

00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:29.739
Typically, autistic people
are very literal thinkers.

00:16:29.770 --> 00:16:33.245
They can be direct
and have very to-the-point communication.

00:16:34.090 --> 00:16:38.139
They can experience
sensory processing overload,

00:16:38.830 --> 00:16:42.130
and they frequently prefer
consistency, dependability,

00:16:42.190 --> 00:16:43.190
and uniformity.

00:16:43.780 --> 00:16:48.850
Just to help make the point
of the very literal thinkers,

00:16:48.910 --> 00:16:51.747
I've got this image here of--

00:16:52.738 --> 00:16:53.979
oh, I've forgotten his name.

00:16:54.009 --> 00:16:56.588
I'm not a big Guardians
of the Galaxy person,

00:16:56.589 --> 00:16:59.770
but it's a character
from Guardians of the Galaxy saying,

00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:01.089
"Nothing goes over my head.

00:17:01.390 --> 00:17:02.859
My reflexes are too fast.

00:17:02.919 --> 00:17:04.212
I would catch it."

00:17:05.140 --> 00:17:10.375
That just makes me think
of my son every time I see that.

00:17:13.472 --> 00:17:16.262
Oops, how'd that go?

00:17:18.032 --> 00:17:19.033
There we go.

00:17:20.410 --> 00:17:23.173
Okay, so then we also have learning
disabilities.

00:17:23.174 --> 00:17:28.088
This is a wide variety
of information processing problems

00:17:28.089 --> 00:17:32.140
that prevent a person from learning
a new skill and using it effectively.

00:17:33.369 --> 00:17:37.232
We see learning disabilities
with reading, which is dyslexia,

00:17:37.869 --> 00:17:41.289
writing, which is dysgraphia,
processing numbers,

00:17:41.290 --> 00:17:42.290
which is dyscalculia.

00:17:42.609 --> 00:17:44.329
I'm pretty sure
there's a couple other ones,

00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:48.163
but these are just the ones
that I wanted to address tonight.

00:17:48.164 --> 00:17:50.140
Really important to note,

00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:55.329
these are not related
in any way to intelligence.

00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:59.590
Somebody having a learning disability
doesn't mean that they aren't as smart.

00:18:00.130 --> 00:18:04.748
It just means that they have
this processing problem that makes things

00:18:04.749 --> 00:18:05.749
a little bit harder.

00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:08.184
Not impossible, just harder.

00:18:09.339 --> 00:18:14.949
I hope this image of numbers and letters
isn't too crazy for it's actually starting

00:18:14.950 --> 00:18:16.330
to bother me.

00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:20.892
Then we've got memory impairments.

00:18:21.939 --> 00:18:24.729
Inability to remember information,
which can come

00:18:24.730 --> 00:18:27.908
from a variety of other disabilities
or disorders,

00:18:27.909 --> 00:18:31.449
or can just be its own issue on its own.

00:18:32.109 --> 00:18:35.499
We've short
or long-term memory impairments.

00:18:35.919 --> 00:18:40.284
We have things like dementia,
concussion, PTSD.

00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:45.400
Those are all things that will affect
memory in very specific ways,

00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:47.469
but then there's also working memory,

00:18:48.459 --> 00:18:53.589
which is what can you keep in,
so for as an example,

00:18:53.740 --> 00:18:56.830
if somebody were to say
to you, what is five plus two?

00:18:57.940 --> 00:19:00.760
You store those two numbers
in your head as you're adding them,

00:19:01.150 --> 00:19:04.869
and so somebody with working
memory may not remember those very,

00:19:04.870 --> 00:19:07.599
very short things
that they're using right now.

00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:14.166
They may not be able to carry
on other tasks that follow from that.

00:19:17.046 --> 00:19:23.466
My favorite memory loss icon
is Dory here from Finding Nemo.

00:19:26.586 --> 00:19:29.436
I believe this is the last one,

00:19:30.639 --> 00:19:32.052
mental health.

00:19:32.053 --> 00:19:34.630
This is something that I don't think
a lot of people consider

00:19:34.690 --> 00:19:37.208
when we're talking
about neurodisabilities,

00:19:37.209 --> 00:19:40.599
but it absolutely can have
an impact in a variety of ways.

00:19:41.589 --> 00:19:44.739
Mental health can affect
cognitive, emotional,

00:19:44.799 --> 00:19:46.179
and behavioral well-being.

00:19:47.349 --> 00:19:50.859
It basically affects how we think,
feel, and act.

00:19:51.610 --> 00:19:56.499
There's, again,
a variety of different disorders

00:19:56.529 --> 00:19:57.760
and disabilities here,

00:19:58.059 --> 00:20:03.066
some including paranoia, schizophrenia,
depression, and anxiety.

00:20:03.790 --> 00:20:06.128
People
with some of these mental health issues

00:20:06.129 --> 00:20:10.050
could experience difficulty focusing,
difficulty processing

00:20:10.051 --> 00:20:12.034
or understanding information.

00:20:13.179 --> 00:20:16.899
An interesting thing
that I recently learned was that,

00:20:16.989 --> 00:20:19.420
or didn't really necessarily think
of in this way,

00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:22.926
but even
if the mental health issues themselves

00:20:22.927 --> 00:20:26.008
aren't causing difficulties or struggles,

00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:32.100
the effects of their medication
that they may be taking could have

00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:33.990
side effects that impact.

00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:38.130
Some medication side effects
are blurred vision or hand tremors.

00:20:38.699 --> 00:20:44.436
Those kinds of things could also affect
websites accessibility.

00:20:50.879 --> 00:20:52.959
Oh, I was wrong.
There's one more.

00:20:53.609 --> 00:20:55.379
Seizure and vestibular disorders.

00:20:55.649 --> 00:20:58.529
This is the one
that you will probably find

00:20:58.530 --> 00:21:02.070
when you're doing
that top 10 accessibility fixes.

00:21:03.329 --> 00:21:06.148
These are disorders that can cause
seizures or other issues

00:21:06.149 --> 00:21:07.408
with the vestibular system,

00:21:07.409 --> 00:21:09.840
which is your inner ear
and brain connection.

00:21:10.349 --> 00:21:13.739
These are things like epilepsy,
migraines, nausea,

00:21:13.980 --> 00:21:16.097
and dizziness.

00:21:17.790 --> 00:21:20.608
This lots of times you might find
things about like,

00:21:20.609 --> 00:21:22.709
don't have flash and things
are like movement.

00:21:23.190 --> 00:21:28.288
That's usually related to the epilepsy,
at least it's the first thing that people

00:21:28.289 --> 00:21:31.858
tend to think of when thinking
about those kinds of things with websites,

00:21:31.859 --> 00:21:34.530
but it does affect
all kinds of different things.

00:21:34.949 --> 00:21:36.689
Like I said, with my migraines,

00:21:37.259 --> 00:21:38.909
if it's really bad,

00:21:38.969 --> 00:21:42.150
I have a really hard time
looking at websites in general.

00:21:42.929 --> 00:21:45.269
If there are different things
happening that we're going to talk

00:21:45.270 --> 00:21:46.507
about in a little bit,

00:21:47.010 --> 00:21:50.308
they can actually make my migraine worse
or make it really extra hard for me

00:21:50.309 --> 00:21:53.497
to be looking at a screen
and dealing with what's going on.

00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:59.488
So I've got this image here
of what I'm pretty sure is a path

00:21:59.489 --> 00:22:03.397
with trees down each side
and it's completely blurred and swirled,

00:22:03.599 --> 00:22:07.987
so you've got that feeling of dizziness
and potentially nausea.

00:22:09.690 --> 00:22:12.277
Hopefully you don't though,
from looking at that.

00:22:14.279 --> 00:22:18.989
Now that you've got
an understanding of what people

00:22:18.990 --> 00:22:22.327
with neurological disabilities
might be experiencing with your website,

00:22:23.220 --> 00:22:26.819
or at least how they may be dealing
with things for themselves that may impact

00:22:26.940 --> 00:22:28.649
their experience on your website,

00:22:29.279 --> 00:22:33.180
how can you ensure that you are making
your best efforts to make

00:22:33.269 --> 00:22:36.149
your website accessible
for this group of people

00:22:36.390 --> 00:22:38.969
so that it's a pleasant
and successful experience?

00:22:39.329 --> 00:22:42.960
It's also at the end of the day,
this is about you and your website.

00:22:43.289 --> 00:22:44.409
If you're trying to convert,

00:22:45.029 --> 00:22:48.219
people can't navigate your site,
you won't get those conversions.

00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:52.798
Again, this is not a comprehensive list,
but a few tips hopefully

00:22:52.799 --> 00:22:54.520
to get you started in the right direction.

00:22:57.240 --> 00:22:59.639
You may actually already be familiar
with some of these,

00:22:59.939 --> 00:23:03.145
whether it's for some
of these basic accessibility tips

00:23:03.146 --> 00:23:04.823
that you may have heard of.

00:23:04.824 --> 00:23:08.069
It could be because
of something else like SEO

00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:11.400
that sometimes comes into play
as you learn some of these things.

00:23:11.970 --> 00:23:17.700
Then even just if you're a content writer
or if you're a front-end developer,

00:23:18.059 --> 00:23:21.329
you may just have experienced
these as best practices

00:23:21.629 --> 00:23:25.889
and maybe don't even know
why they're the best practice

00:23:25.919 --> 00:23:27.535
for websites.

00:23:27.536 --> 00:23:29.758
Hopefully, this will give you
a little bit more information

00:23:29.759 --> 00:23:33.000
and a little bit more ground to stand on
if you ever have to convince somebody

00:23:33.209 --> 00:23:34.874
that this is the right way to go.

00:23:37.237 --> 00:23:40.244
We'll start with text alignment.

00:23:41.909 --> 00:23:46.619
You might instinctively do this
because it's just what we've gotten used

00:23:46.620 --> 00:23:53.716
to with web but left align is usually
the best thing to go with text.

00:23:55.020 --> 00:23:58.739
Some people just feel like it looks
more modern, more professional,

00:23:59.369 --> 00:24:03.689
but it also does have benefits
to people who are easily distracted,

00:24:04.020 --> 00:24:05.879
people who are having trouble focusing,

00:24:06.509 --> 00:24:10.649
people with reading disabilities,
lots of different people.

00:24:11.490 --> 00:24:12.989
A lot of these actually,

00:24:13.350 --> 00:24:19.079
your average Joe kind of person
would also sometimes have these issues

00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:20.759
when we go too far,

00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:25.110
too intense with some of these different
don'ts that we're going to look at.

00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:28.559
The do here is left-align text.

00:24:29.070 --> 00:24:33.209
There are two don'ts,
so don't center and don't justify.

00:24:34.319 --> 00:24:38.400
These are not-- well,
the centering I'll say is not an absolute.

00:24:38.609 --> 00:24:41.130
I don't think
on web you should ever justify though.

00:24:42.030 --> 00:24:43.030
You can see here,

00:24:43.260 --> 00:24:47.759
and I know it's a bit hard on a monitor
if we had a really big screen

00:24:47.849 --> 00:24:53.459
or bigger examples if I'm not very good
at flipping between slides

00:24:53.519 --> 00:24:57.718
and the internet in a demo,
so I can't do it that way,

00:24:57.719 --> 00:25:03.059
but trying to give you an example here
of this is what centered text looks like.

00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:09.899
The longer it is, the harder
if you can imagine reading

00:25:09.930 --> 00:25:14.610
across and after several lines,
trying at the end of one line,

00:25:14.909 --> 00:25:20.518
trying to figure out where the next line
starts when they're all jagged and there's

00:25:20.519 --> 00:25:22.529
no rhyme or reason to it.

00:25:22.860 --> 00:25:24.149
It can get really difficult.

00:25:25.230 --> 00:25:27.870
That's one of the reasons to not center.

00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:31.260
Sometimes if it's short text,
just a couple of lines,

00:25:31.289 --> 00:25:32.289
it's not too bad,

00:25:32.309 --> 00:25:36.689
but when we have long lines
like this, long paragraphs,

00:25:36.809 --> 00:25:40.770
wide paragraphs, it can be really hard
to read centered text.

00:25:41.580 --> 00:25:42.838
Justified text,

00:25:42.839 --> 00:25:47.249
and this is where you've got the text goes
all the way to the left and all the way

00:25:47.250 --> 00:25:51.899
to the right, so you end up with bigger,
different-sized gaps in between words.

00:25:52.529 --> 00:25:57.629
This is something that we're used
to seeing in books, in print,

00:25:57.960 --> 00:25:59.729
but when it comes to online,

00:26:00.029 --> 00:26:03.778
it actually, and possibly this
is an issue in print too,

00:26:03.779 --> 00:26:09.149
I guess I never really considered
print accessibility very much.

00:26:10.230 --> 00:26:14.279
What you can see here is these big gaps
that get left,

00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:17.969
they actually create patterns in the text.

00:26:18.209 --> 00:26:22.469
Somebody who is easily distracted
might lock onto those patterns

00:26:22.470 --> 00:26:24.480
and they call them white rivers.

00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:28.620
Instead of seeing the words,
all they can see is the white space

00:26:28.649 --> 00:26:30.180
in between them.

00:26:30.330 --> 00:26:33.000
If you can't see the words,
it makes it really hard to read.

00:26:37.049 --> 00:26:39.210
The next one is line length.

00:26:39.269 --> 00:26:42.359
This goes hand in hand with the alignment.

00:26:43.649 --> 00:26:46.800
Ideally, do use shorter lines.

00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:50.879
Shorter line length,
don't use longer full-width paragraphs.

00:26:50.910 --> 00:26:53.399
If you can imagine,
especially if something

00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:57.269
is full width and then you've got
a 27-inch monitor with your screen

00:26:57.719 --> 00:27:01.139
that big, trying to read
all the way across.

00:27:01.319 --> 00:27:05.100
Then, like I said on the previous slide,
trying to go from the end of this line

00:27:05.309 --> 00:27:09.359
and find the beginning of this line
when you've got all that screen to cross

00:27:09.719 --> 00:27:12.389
can be really tricky
to find where you are.

00:27:13.379 --> 00:27:16.620
It also just becomes harder to scan.

00:27:17.460 --> 00:27:21.718
We know that people
tend not to read websites in depth,

00:27:21.719 --> 00:27:22.848
they scan websites.

00:27:22.979 --> 00:27:26.999
When you've got narrower text
that is left aligned,

00:27:27.030 --> 00:27:31.290
it's a lot easier to scan and find
the information that you're looking for.

00:27:35.429 --> 00:27:38.671
Couple of do's and don'ts
for navigation here.

00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:43.320
Do make important information easy
to find.

00:27:44.129 --> 00:27:45.690
Do make your site searchable,

00:27:45.870 --> 00:27:50.671
and do group similar pages into submenus
to keep your top navigation short.

00:27:52.081 --> 00:27:54.899
Making the important information easy
to find.

00:27:55.529 --> 00:27:59.250
If you know that people
are always going to this page,

00:27:59.669 --> 00:28:01.231
whatever that may be,

00:28:01.530 --> 00:28:04.409
you may want to consider
that goes in your top nav.

00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:06.971
You want to make it really easy
for people to get the information

00:28:06.972 --> 00:28:08.002
that they're trying to find.

00:28:08.003 --> 00:28:10.828
If you know there's a page
that they're struggling to find,

00:28:10.829 --> 00:28:12.809
but that they really need
to get to, again,

00:28:12.839 --> 00:28:16.323
make that really easy
in the navigation to find.

00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:21.689
Having a search in your navigation
or in your header area

00:28:22.290 --> 00:28:24.980
helps people in a variety of ways.

00:28:25.559 --> 00:28:28.495
If I've already gone to your site
and I know I'm looking for something,

00:28:28.496 --> 00:28:33.184
but I can't remember what page it was on,
having that search can really help.

00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:39.299
Likewise, if I've never been
to your site and I know

00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:44.879
that there's probably some information
about XYZ on here that I would find useful

00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:46.106
or interesting,

00:28:46.107 --> 00:28:49.620
I don't want to have to navigate
through your whole homepage hoping to find

00:28:49.621 --> 00:28:52.078
a link and try to search
through every page.

00:28:52.079 --> 00:28:54.960
Having that search
is really, really helpful,

00:28:55.619 --> 00:28:58.679
and that will help keep people
more focused.

00:28:58.680 --> 00:29:01.993
They'll get less distracted
by all of the other things on your page.

00:29:02.385 --> 00:29:06.305
Then grouping similar pages
to keep that top navigation short.

00:29:06.540 --> 00:29:09.836
On the flip side,
don't build long top menus.

00:29:10.619 --> 00:29:14.129
They tend to overflow, especially
if they start going on to multiple lines,

00:29:14.669 --> 00:29:17.160
all of those options

00:29:18.509 --> 00:29:22.289
staring at you when you're trying
to figure out where you want

00:29:22.290 --> 00:29:25.020
to go can be really overwhelming
for some people.

00:29:25.469 --> 00:29:30.180
If you keep things short and concise
and group similar pages together,

00:29:31.170 --> 00:29:34.620
things that make sense to group
together, that will really help people

00:29:34.740 --> 00:29:35.789
navigate your site.

00:29:36.300 --> 00:29:37.679
Also really important,

00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:39.780
don't hide your contact information.

00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:45.838
If people need to contact you,
we've gotten used to certain standards

00:29:45.839 --> 00:29:49.920
and norms, so contact information
is usually like in the top right.

00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:53.950
If it's not there, usually
the next place you go look is

00:29:53.951 --> 00:29:56.549
in the footer,
but almost always like that top right,

00:29:56.580 --> 00:29:59.819
there's no real reason
to deviate from that.

00:30:00.659 --> 00:30:01.980
Keep it where people expect it.

00:30:02.700 --> 00:30:07.019
Then also don't create mismatched submenus
that don't belong under

00:30:07.020 --> 00:30:08.159
their parent menu item.

00:30:08.459 --> 00:30:09.989
People will never find them that way.

00:30:10.589 --> 00:30:13.829
Keep things short, easy
to find, searchable,

00:30:14.670 --> 00:30:16.019
and that will be really helpful.

00:30:19.409 --> 00:30:23.010
Also a couple of words
on screen readers and captioning.

00:30:23.099 --> 00:30:29.179
I know that this
does fall under either people

00:30:29.180 --> 00:30:33.560
with audio disabilities or people
with visual disabilities,

00:30:33.829 --> 00:30:36.709
but they aren't actually
the only people using screen readers,

00:30:36.949 --> 00:30:38.959
captioning, transcripts,

00:30:40.839 --> 00:30:41.839
and subtitles.

00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:45.979
There are a variety of people
who use them for different reasons.

00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:50.540
You want to make sure
that when you are putting out content,

00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:56.179
that it can be consumed in multiple ways
and that there's the ability to get

00:30:56.180 --> 00:31:01.369
the audio or the video,
I guess, the audio of any video

00:31:01.370 --> 00:31:06.139
or of text and transcripts of audio
or video so that people have access

00:31:06.140 --> 00:31:11.998
to the content if they can't or prefer
not to use your audio or video files.

00:31:13.734 --> 00:31:17.630
As I said, don't assume screen readers
and captioning are only for people

00:31:17.631 --> 00:31:19.838
with audio and visual disabilities.

00:31:20.060 --> 00:31:28.819
In addition to somebody say who has ADHD,
they might find it hard to follow along

00:31:28.820 --> 00:31:31.219
with video if they're just watching it.

00:31:32.210 --> 00:31:39.230
I know there are a lot of people with ADHD
who actually need to have multiple things

00:31:39.260 --> 00:31:42.049
going on at once, things
that they're controlling

00:31:43.100 --> 00:31:46.760
in order to concentrate
on the thing they need to concentrate on,

00:31:46.879 --> 00:31:47.959
and so having

00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:53.240
subtitles on a video is really helpful
to keep them focused.

00:31:54.260 --> 00:31:56.269
Then there are also people,

00:31:56.270 --> 00:31:58.399
if you think
about second language learners,

00:31:58.699 --> 00:32:03.320
they may be using your videos
or your audio or the transcripts

00:32:03.650 --> 00:32:07.909
to help them understand,
but also to help them learn.

00:32:08.450 --> 00:32:12.590
There's a wide variety of people
using screen readers and captioning.

00:32:14.450 --> 00:32:16.999
Another example, I mentioned
the working memory before.

00:32:17.300 --> 00:32:19.999
Subtitles on a video tutorial,
for example,

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:21.710
can be really helpful for somebody

00:32:22.249 --> 00:32:27.523
with working memory issues to follow along
and keep on track with what you're saying

00:32:27.524 --> 00:32:28.712
and showing.

00:32:31.459 --> 00:32:34.535
Forms are always a fun one
for accessibility.

00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:40.368
I'm not going to get
into all of the different kinds of traps

00:32:40.369 --> 00:32:44.419
that you could have on forms,
but something about labels,

00:32:44.570 --> 00:32:46.340
really important to bring up.

00:32:46.850 --> 00:32:52.040
Make sure that you are using labels
and that you're not using placeholder text

00:32:52.250 --> 00:32:53.250
as labels.

00:32:53.390 --> 00:32:54.499
They are not the same.

00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:59.007
They do not behave the same
for screen readers.

00:32:59.419 --> 00:33:01.178
Also, you can see,

00:33:01.999 --> 00:33:05.330
if you see these pictures,
the first picture here is a form

00:33:05.629 --> 00:33:07.819
and it has a name input,

00:33:07.850 --> 00:33:10.280
an email input, and a comment
or message input.

00:33:10.430 --> 00:33:14.388
They're all properly labeled
with those two items above

00:33:14.389 --> 00:33:15.389
the input field.

00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:18.650
When I type my name,
Christina, into the name field,

00:33:18.679 --> 00:33:20.264
you can still see it's a name field.

00:33:20.749 --> 00:33:24.349
On the right side, we've got
the same image almost,

00:33:24.620 --> 00:33:27.169
except instead of those labels,

00:33:27.709 --> 00:33:28.879
name, email,

00:33:28.910 --> 00:33:32.750
and comment or message are put
in as placeholder text.

00:33:33.199 --> 00:33:35.960
When I start typing my name
into the name field,

00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:39.080
it doesn't say name anymore.

00:33:39.980 --> 00:33:41.600
If I don't remember

00:33:42.140 --> 00:33:43.609
what I was putting there,

00:33:44.660 --> 00:33:47.750
I can't fill
the form out properly anymore.

00:33:48.500 --> 00:33:53.479
This has happened to me so many times
when there's usually signing up

00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:57.320
for mail lists of different types

00:33:58.550 --> 00:34:00.649
when there's two input fields.

00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:07.489
I will often just automatically assume
that the order is name and email,

00:34:07.909 --> 00:34:11.090
but it's not always that way,
and so I start typing it

00:34:11.299 --> 00:34:15.290
in and then all of a sudden realize,
I don't think this is the right thing,

00:34:15.710 --> 00:34:18.499
but even backing out doesn't get me
the placeholder anymore

00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:21.487
and I'm not 100% sure what field I'm in.

00:34:21.889 --> 00:34:26.270
You want to make sure that you are using
proper labels as placeholder text.

00:34:30.589 --> 00:34:34.340
Order of elements
on your site is important.

00:34:34.519 --> 00:34:38.988
That's not just to say
how it looks, but also how it works

00:34:38.989 --> 00:34:43.159
when you are tabbing through a website
if you're using keyboard only.

00:34:45.619 --> 00:34:49.340
Similar to the contact
being somewhere where you can see it,

00:34:49.399 --> 00:34:51.409
stick to web standards and norms,

00:34:52.070 --> 00:34:54.110
ensure that your tab order is correct.

00:34:54.649 --> 00:34:59.149
Don't be over-creative and don't expect
users to understand novel designs.

00:34:59.839 --> 00:35:03.559
I know that we all want
something really cool and interesting

00:35:03.560 --> 00:35:06.289
on our sites and there's
lots of ways to do that,

00:35:07.069 --> 00:35:12.379
but you want to stick with staying
within the standards and norms

00:35:12.410 --> 00:35:15.739
that we have all gotten used to.

00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:20.359
Unless you're a really big company
that can break the mold,

00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:22.490
but for most of us,

00:35:22.969 --> 00:35:27.199
sticking to the standards and norms
are going to be what's best.

00:35:27.799 --> 00:35:29.149
I have an example here,

00:35:29.180 --> 00:35:32.179
and this is one that I come
across frequently

00:35:33.409 --> 00:35:36.770
and I still have to remind
myself how to use this.

00:35:37.310 --> 00:35:39.409
We've got here a screengrab.

00:35:39.800 --> 00:35:44.035
It's for an SMS authentication
and it's got my phone number

00:35:44.036 --> 00:35:47.940
blacked out there, Xed out.

00:35:48.444 --> 00:35:50.119
Then it's got, it says,

00:35:50.150 --> 00:35:53.680
it's got a label over an input field
that says "enter code".

00:35:53.869 --> 00:35:56.719
To the right of that input field,
it says "send code".

00:35:56.720 --> 00:36:02.030
That send code button
is a very light gray,

00:36:02.330 --> 00:36:04.309
almost the same color
as the white background.

00:36:05.029 --> 00:36:09.346
Then it's got a blue
verify button underneath it.

00:36:10.759 --> 00:36:13.850
I cannot tell you
how many times I've come to this site,

00:36:14.270 --> 00:36:19.699
typed in my login creds, got
to this page, and sat there waiting,

00:36:20.029 --> 00:36:22.969
staring at my phone,
waiting for my code to send

00:36:22.999 --> 00:36:26.359
because the first thing I see here
is "enter code".

00:36:26.870 --> 00:36:29.273
I assume it's automatically sent to me.

00:36:30.350 --> 00:36:31.519
Then eventually I remember,

00:36:31.520 --> 00:36:33.349
right, I have to hit
the send the code button.

00:36:33.949 --> 00:36:36.680
If you look at this, you don't think

00:36:37.909 --> 00:36:41.419
the button after the input field
is what I have to hit to get the info

00:36:41.420 --> 00:36:43.130
to go into the input field.

00:36:43.820 --> 00:36:47.870
Likewise, if you were tabbing,
you would hit the enter code field

00:36:47.930 --> 00:36:49.879
before you hit the send code field.

00:36:51.170 --> 00:36:56.239
This should really be set up in a way
that the send code button is above

00:36:56.240 --> 00:36:59.929
or before the input field
for entering the code.

00:37:03.589 --> 00:37:09.986
Content is another thing
that can be really tricky sometimes.

00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:12.926
Lots of times,

00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:16.429
if you're building out sites
and then you hand it over to somebody else

00:37:16.430 --> 00:37:21.326
to do content, you may have
a really accessible site

00:37:21.649 --> 00:37:26.183
and then they add all of the content
and suddenly

00:37:26.184 --> 00:37:28.642
we're experiencing some issues.

00:37:28.850 --> 00:37:31.728
You want to make sure
that when you have content,

00:37:31.729 --> 00:37:37.518
that your content is easy to understand
and any images or icons that are replacing

00:37:37.519 --> 00:37:39.080
text make sense.

00:37:39.409 --> 00:37:41.179
Ideally, have labels for them,

00:37:42.079 --> 00:37:43.190
but if you don't,

00:37:43.580 --> 00:37:46.790
they really should make
sense if they're important.

00:37:48.079 --> 00:37:51.050
You want to not use
complicated words and phrasing.

00:37:51.919 --> 00:37:55.219
If you use acronyms, make sure
the first time you use them

00:37:55.610 --> 00:37:58.791
that you spell out
what the acronym is for.

00:37:59.547 --> 00:38:00.547
Metaphors

00:38:00.949 --> 00:38:04.158
can get tricky sometimes, again,
going back to somebody

00:38:04.159 --> 00:38:08.085
who thinks very literally,
may not understand what you're getting at.

00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:12.409
Which isn't to say you can't have
fun with your content.

00:38:12.410 --> 00:38:15.138
Again, I mean, none of this
is about trying

00:38:15.139 --> 00:38:19.338
to take away creativity
but just being aware of how you may impact

00:38:19.339 --> 00:38:21.949
some people and how some people
may not understand what you're trying

00:38:21.950 --> 00:38:24.633
to say and so your message will be lost.

00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:28.670
This is an example that has
since been corrected,

00:38:29.329 --> 00:38:35.209
but this was actually
on the WordPress admin dashboard

00:38:35.240 --> 00:38:39.740
if you're familiar
with the events section where it tells you

00:38:40.309 --> 00:38:44.329
all of the events, meetups, WordCamps
that are coming up near you.

00:38:47.179 --> 00:38:49.939
It just reads, "Attend
an upcoming event near you,"

00:38:50.029 --> 00:38:52.404
and then there's a blue pencil icon.

00:38:53.269 --> 00:38:56.690
Now, I don't know about you,
but I've gotten used

00:38:56.719 --> 00:38:59.149
to associating that pencil icon

00:38:59.749 --> 00:39:03.560
with an ability to edit something.

00:39:04.159 --> 00:39:05.180
When I look at this,

00:39:05.720 --> 00:39:11.089
I don't understand or I didn't understand
what it was that I was expected to edit.

00:39:11.119 --> 00:39:14.869
Why, how do I-- do I edit the attend?

00:39:16.790 --> 00:39:20.060
I can't edit events,
I just didn't understand how it works.

00:39:20.090 --> 00:39:22.969
One day I just clicked on it
and discovered

00:39:23.359 --> 00:39:27.650
that what it actually did was let you edit
the near you part.

00:39:27.830 --> 00:39:32.060
It let you edit the location
that it was showing you events from,

00:39:32.719 --> 00:39:34.640
but that was not clear at all.

00:39:35.479 --> 00:39:36.950
I ended up actually filing

00:39:37.670 --> 00:39:40.489
a ticket and it was remedied.

00:39:40.520 --> 00:39:45.319
I believe it now has like a locator pin
kind of an icon.

00:39:45.829 --> 00:39:48.799
I think the wording
has changed as well if I recall correctly,

00:39:49.309 --> 00:39:52.257
because this
was just completely confusing.

00:39:55.561 --> 00:39:57.230
<v Jessica Sams> Thank you so much,
Christina.

00:39:57.231 --> 00:40:00.490
We're nearing the end amount
of time we have.

00:40:00.491 --> 00:40:02.480
Do you have any closing thoughts?

00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:06.918
I'm going to let you wrap up here
and just letting you know

00:40:06.919 --> 00:40:09.710
that we're almost out of time.

00:40:09.949 --> 00:40:11.150
<v Christina Workman> Sure thing.

00:40:12.799 --> 00:40:14.329
Just really quick,

00:40:14.389 --> 00:40:16.818
I want to just say,
make sure that any video

00:40:16.819 --> 00:40:18.217
and audio

00:40:18.290 --> 00:40:21.828
automatically playing have
pause buttons, super important.

00:40:22.069 --> 00:40:25.496
Time pressures, you want
to reduce as much as possible.

00:40:26.510 --> 00:40:28.016
Just in closing,

00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:32.330
going back to that Linux software,
our brains aren't all running

00:40:32.359 --> 00:40:34.288
on the same operating software.

00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:38.569
You want to make sure that your website
is supporting and accessible to

00:40:38.570 --> 00:40:40.700
as many options as possible.

00:40:41.064 --> 00:40:46.175
I do have some links to some resources
that I used when I was putting

00:40:46.176 --> 00:40:51.378
these slides together a while ago,
but other than that, that's me.

00:40:51.379 --> 00:40:55.465
You can find me
on Twitter @amethystanswers.

00:40:57.019 --> 00:40:59.629
<v Jessica Sams> Thank you.
Her slides are going to be available.

00:40:59.630 --> 00:41:03.409
They're already out there on
the WordPress Accessibility Day website.

00:41:05.960 --> 00:41:09.740
What we're going to do now is
if you have unanswered questions,

00:41:09.769 --> 00:41:13.316
head to the Slack and hopefully
she will monitor the Slack.

00:41:13.317 --> 00:41:15.152
We're going to--

00:41:15.153 --> 00:41:16.708
yes?
<v Christina Workman> Yes.

00:41:17.296 --> 00:41:20.649
<v Jessica Sams> Okay. We're going
to transition the entire Zoom call now.

00:41:20.650 --> 00:41:26.208
This Zoom call is going to end
and participants to pick up

00:41:26.209 --> 00:41:27.769
with your next Zoom call,

00:41:27.770 --> 00:41:33.199
you'll need to go to your email
and search for the original email

00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:34.609
for the next session.

00:41:36.379 --> 00:41:37.879
If you don't see it in your inbox,

00:41:37.909 --> 00:41:40.520
please go ahead and check
your spam folder.

00:41:41.780 --> 00:41:42.979
Rejoin that next one.

00:41:43.130 --> 00:41:45.981
The next session is going
to be called Accessible Design,

00:41:45.982 --> 00:41:50.614
WCAG or Trendy?
No, WCAG AND Trendy.

00:41:53.660 --> 00:41:56.960
Hashtags again,
if you want to go ahead and share

00:41:57.590 --> 00:42:07.832
the knowledge that you learned,
it's #WPA11Yday and WPAD2024.

00:42:09.596 --> 00:42:14.020
Does anybody on the tech team
have any other notes?

00:42:16.148 --> 00:42:20.600
Christina, we really, really apologize
for all of the technical problems.

00:42:21.132 --> 00:42:23.120
<v Christina Workman> No worries, I as well.

00:42:23.179 --> 00:42:27.119
I don't know what happened when I,
anyways, yes.

00:42:27.120 --> 00:42:32.299
<v Jessica Sams> They want to express
their gratitude for you being able

00:42:32.300 --> 00:42:36.612
to restart when we needed to.
Thanks for that.

00:42:37.969 --> 00:42:40.700
We're going to see everybody
in the new Zoom call

00:42:40.759 --> 00:42:42.746
at the top of the hour.
Thank you.

00:42:42.950 --> 00:42:46.880
