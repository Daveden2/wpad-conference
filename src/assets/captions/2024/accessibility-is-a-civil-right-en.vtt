The Digital Accessibility Legal Landscape

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.220
for the WordPress Community,
with Lainey Feingold.

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:51.340
Welcome, Lainey.

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.300
<v Lainey Feingold> Glad to be here.

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:54.060
Thanks, Amber.

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:57.940
-For everyone who has not had
the opportunity to meet Lainey yet,

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.900
Lainey is a disability
rights lawyer, author,

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:03.180
and international speaker,

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:07.260
who has worked
with the digital accessibility space since 1995.

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.540
She helped negotiate
the first web accessibility agreement

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.540
in the United States in 2000,

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.620
and has worked with the blind community
and dozens of communities

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.900
and public sector organizations
on accessibility initiatives since then.

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.420
Lainey is the author of the book,
Structured Negotiation:

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:27.100
A Winning Alternative to Lawsuits,

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.940
which was released
in its second edition in 2021.

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.380
She has been named a "legal rebel,"

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.820
which we love,
and a problem solver of the year

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:39.860
by the American Bar Association,

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:44.620
and twice received a California Lawyer
Magazine Attorney of the Year award.

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.820
Lainey serves on the board
of Tech Access or Teach Access,

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.380
a nonprofit collaborating
with education institutions,

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.620
disability organizations, industries,

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.900
and governments to close
the digital accessibility skills gap.

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.420
We are honored to have Lainey here
for our keynote presentation.

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:04.620
I know that you are
all very much going to enjoy this talk.

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:09.700
Please feel free to add
any questions into the Zoom Q&amp;A panel.

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:14.540
I will come back at the end of the hour
to pass those questions on to Lainey.

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.460
Of course, you can continue chatting
in the chat if you would like,

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.100
but it is important to please
get the questions in the Q&amp;A.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:22.580
Thank you so much, Lainey.

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.100
I will let you take it away.

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:26.020
-Excellent.

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.700
Thank you.

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:27.940
Welcome, everyone.

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:29.780
I'm so glad to be here.

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.500
I do have a deck,
which I am now going to share on the screen.

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:35.780
Let's see.

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:39.900
I think it looks good.

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:41.620
Amber, you'll let me know if it does not.

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:46.780
Really glad to be here.

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.740
I changed my shirt this morning

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:51.540
when I saw the organizers
were wearing orange,

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.700
the color of the swag T-shirt,

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:59.220
because it's a real honor to be part
of the WordPress Accessibility Day

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:03.620
and to be with all
of you all around the world.

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.620
I was so moved
to see everybody's role

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.980
and all the countries everybody's from

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.980
and the sectors
that everybody works for.

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.340
We're going to talk about the law.

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.500
As we said,
the title is Accessibility is a Civil Right:

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.220
The Digital Accessibility Legal Landscape

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.340
for the WordPress Accessibility Community,

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.380
the WordPress community broadly.

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:33.340
I have my website up here,
which is LFLegal.com.

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:38.020
I write a lot about digital
accessibility best practices,

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:39.420
the legal space.

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:42.340
I write a lot about
collaborative problem solving,

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.060
which is how I've practiced law
for the last 30 years.

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.220
Everything on my site
is Creative Commons.

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:52.860
I hope you will explore it
and use what I write,

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:55.420
let me know
about mistakes and corrections.

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:59.740
It's really there for all of us
to advance digital accessibility.

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:05.980
I also have on this slide
no legal advice in this talk.

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:07.500
Please remember that.

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.620
If you need a lawyer,
if you have a legal question,

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:11.460
please contact a lawyer.

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:14.060
Everything I do in public,

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:17.900
I try to share what I know
and to the best of my ability,

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:19.500
but it's not legal advice.

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:21.260
A lot to cover.

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:24.420
If you see me looking down,
I'm looking at my timer I set

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:26.860
because I want to be sure
to stick to time.

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:28.020
I'm not multitasking.

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:32.620
Let's see.

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:34.860
Today's roadmap.

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:36.100
There's a lot to talk about.

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.020
What is digital accessibility?

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:41.660
Why are we even talking about the law
at an accessibility gathering?

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.580
What are the frameworks,
US and global?

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:47.500
What are the remedies,
because laws come with remedies.

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:49.140
How are the laws implemented?

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.260
What are my favorites
in the legal space?

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:53.620
I wrote here not so much favorites,

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:57.020
but things I really don't like about
the legal space right now.

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:00.900
What we can expect on the horizon,
a little touch on law

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:04.460
and WordPress contracts
that you might want to think about.

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:11.180
How can we talk about the law in a positive,
advancing accessibility way

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:15.420
without fear that
so often accompanies legal conversations,

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:17.180
and how can we stay current?

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:20.740
My roadmap picture here
is a road in Northern California.

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:23.180
I'm here in my home office,

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:28.060
where I have worked remotely
since 1996 in Berkeley, California.

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:30.140
This is a Northern California road.

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:31.660
That's the roadmap.

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:33.380
Let's get started.

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:35.300
What is Digital accessibility?

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:39.180
In the background of this slide,
just to know,

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:42.820
it was also in the background
of the front cover, are two leaping dolphins.

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:50.300
I have adopted the dolphin
as a counterpoint to the sea creature

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:53.140
that is so often associated
with lawyers, which is shark.

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:57.740
There was a book written
called Teaching Baby Sharks to Swim.

00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:59.660
It wasn't about teaching sharks.

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:01.020
It was about teaching lawyers.

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:04.540
I knew after 30 years
of collaboration in the legal space,

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:07.420
well, it was about 25 years
when I heard about this book,

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:09.420
I needed another sea creature.

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:13.060
I use a dolphin
as a metaphor for collaboration,

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:17.300
for relationship building,
for sustainable accessibility without fear.

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:20.700
The dolphins will be
in the background swimming

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:22.420
around in some of the slides.

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:25.380
I like to think of digital accessibility

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:28.660
as the engine
of disability inclusion in tech.

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:33.860
It's the difference between inclusion
and exclusion for disabled people,

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:36.940
the difference between inclusion
and exclusion

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:41.140
and the intentional practices
that make inclusion happen.

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:43.900
That's really
what this day is devoted to,

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:47.860
learning and sharing information
about the intentional practices

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:51.220
that make inclusion
of disabled people a reality.

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:56.380
On the web, in today's tech,
digital accessibility is privacy,

00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:59.900
it's security, it's safety,
and it's so much more for disabled people.

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:01.500
It's also ethics.

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:05.740
Digital accessibility
is ethics because it's about autonomy,

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:10.620
and privacy, and choice,
and fairness and non-discrimination.

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:14.540
I like this picture of a door,
very closed up, paint's peeling,

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:16.300
looks like it hasn't been open forever.

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:18.140
There's double locks on it.

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:21.660
That's really what it is
when technology is not accessible,

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:24.140
disabled people are locked out.

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:29.860
Instead I like this,
the open door with the light shining through,

00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:33.460
because in all the work
you're doing, whatever your role is,

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:37.300
and it was, like I said,
so gratifying to see so many roles there.

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:39.820
Whatever your role
and however much you know

00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:43.860
and whatever you're doing,
you're a door opener.

00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:47.860
You're a door opener because accessibility
work opens doors for people.

00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:51.260
Also, digital accessibility
is a bridge to everything.

00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:53.220
This is a picture of a bridge in India.

00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:57.100
I spoke at BarrierBreak's
Inclusive India Conference last year,

00:07:57.220 --> 00:07:58.380
which was such a joy.

00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:01.340
It was really great
to see people from India

00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:07.140
on the list of participants
and here on the conference today.

00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:10.980
So much accessibility work
gets done in India.

00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:14.980
I'm connected
with blind lawyers in India

00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:17.940
who are doing incredible work
advancing accessibility there.

00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:20.660
I feel like India doesn't
get enough attention

00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:22.860
in terms of its role in advancing accessibility.

00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:25.220
This is why I chose the bridge.

00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:27.940
I like to say digital accessibility is a bridge

00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:31.140
because on one side
are all disabled people.

00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:32.980
People who can't see a screen,

00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:35.260
or have cognitive or learning disabilities,

00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:37.940
or can't hear a video or can't hold a mouse.

00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:40.380
On the other side,
everything tech,

00:08:40.540 --> 00:08:43.100
which means
that you're not just a door opener.

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.100
In my mind, you're a bridge builder too.

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:50.260
The reason I start
with what is digital accessibility

00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:53.220
is because if we only think
of accessibility

00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:58.620
as a checklist or a burden
or some narrow thing we have to deal with,

00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:01.740
and we don't think
of digital accessibility

00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:05.100
as something that opens doors
for disabled people

00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:07.340
and connects disabled people to tech.

00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:09.700
We can't really understand why it is

00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:11.060
that we're talking about the law

00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:13.180
at an accessibility conference.

00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:17.660
The reason for talking about the law
at an accessibility conference

00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:20.180
is because accessibility
is a legal right.

00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:23.660
I use the word civil right
in the title of this talk,

00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:25.260
and as I was preparing it,

00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:29.740
I was thinking, "What actually
is the difference between a human right

00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:30.540
and a civil right?"

00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:32.820
In the US, we tend to talk about civil rights.

00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:37.060
I've seen around the world
and with global treaties,

00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:38.540
they tend to talk about human rights.

00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:41.900
Something I probably
should have known a long time ago,

00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:43.420
and many of you probably do know,

00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:47.460
human rights are the rights
we acquire by being alive.

00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:51.140
Things that should be
our inherent right as people.

00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:55.340
Civil rights are those
that we get from laws where we live.

00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:58.860
Civil rights might be different
in different places,

00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:03.860
but human rights are everywhere,
and digital accessibility is both.

00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:06.060
It's both a human right and a civil right

00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:10.060
because it's about participation.

00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:15.340
Think of anything you do,
anything you're working on,

00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:16.660
whatever sector you're in.

00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:21.420
If you're on accessibility,
you're on to helping people participate.

00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:23.900
It's about inclusion,
not exclusion,

00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:27.100
which is why I have the exclusion
double struck out on the slide.

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:28.700
It's about communication.

00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:29.980
It's about education.

00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:31.660
It's about health and safety.

00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:35.100
Just think what's going on in Florida
and the United States right now,

00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:38.420
bracing for another terrible climate crisis hurricane,

00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:42.220
so much information spread out
on the internet.

00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:47.340
Digital without accessibility,
it's a risk to disabled people.

00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:50.100
That's just one example, and so much more.

00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:54.660
I illustrated this slide with a picture

00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:58.660
of a protest march
in the run up to the Americans

00:10:58.740 --> 00:10:59.700
with Disabilities Act.

00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:02.140
There's a lot of people,
people in the front,

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:05.060
you can see a couple people
using wheelchairs

00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:06.300
and someone with a guide dog.

00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:10.580
There's a poster that says,
"Access Is a Civil Right, We Shall Overcome."

00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:14.340
The reason I put this in
is a reminder that these laws

00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:17.780
that we're talking about today,
they don't just fall from the sky.

00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:21.460
They are the result
of organizing, and work,

00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:23.820
and commitment, and blood, sweat,

00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:26.940
and tears of people
with disabilities and allies.

00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:30.460
That's certainly true about
the Americans with Disabilities Act

00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:32.660
and I know it's true around
the world too.

00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:36.220
Another opportunity
when we talk about the law

00:11:36.340 --> 00:11:40.460
to talk about people
is remembering where these laws came from.

00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:45.020
These rights, human rights,
civil rights, are baked into laws.

00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:46.260
I like baking analogy.

00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:49.460
I have raw chocolate chip cookie dough
with yummy,

00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:51.260
it's a close up, you see the chocolate chips,

00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:55.900
to illustrate the fact
that these are just ideas,

00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:58.940
human rights and civil rights
are baked into actual laws.

00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:03.580
I really like this quote from
a woman named Lizzie Kiama from Kenya,

00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:08.300
who I heard
at the Microsoft Ability Summit in 2021,

00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:12.620
the legal framework gives us permission
to dream what is possible,

00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:16.740
the legal framework gives us permission
to dream what is possible.

00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:21.900
Here in the US we have a very strong
and complex framework that we often see,

00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:25.900
like I said, as a burden or something,
"Oh, the lawyers who get--"

00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:28.740
So many people say the lawyers,

00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:31.500
they get involved and it limits
or they say no.

00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:35.420
Lawyers are not just associated
with sharks, they're associated with the no.

00:12:35.620 --> 00:12:39.580
Although I know many lawyers,
hopefully in your organizations,

00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:42.940
are in support
of accessibility and say yes.

00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:47.500
Really important to remember
that having laws allows us

00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:52.860
to have a society or to dream
of a society where everybody's included,

00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:57.260
including the one in six people
around the world who have disabilities.

00:12:57.420 --> 00:13:01.220
What does that framework
that gives us permission

00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:03.180
to dream look like in the US?

00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:07.580
Here's a component
to the US legal framework.

00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:11.460
We have federal laws, national laws,
that apply across the whole country.

00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:14.340
We have regulations based on those laws.

00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:17.020
We have policy statements
from the government.

00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:21.980
There are state laws
in all 50 states.

00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:26.260
Many states have accessibility
or disability inclusion laws.

00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:29.860
We even have local laws
in some cities and some counties.

00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:32.300
Then we have implementation of all that.

00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:35.260
That all works together,
which is why I have a picture here

00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:39.060
of gears showing
that they're working together.

00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:42.060
One says state and local,
one says implement, one says federal.

00:13:42.180 --> 00:13:44.540
Those are the components.

00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:48.460
Obviously, all we can do today
is a very high bird's eye view,

00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:53.180
but I think it's important
to remember how robust that framework is.

00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:58.780
You hear a lot of,
"Oh, somebody lost an accessibility case,"

00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:00.940
and it seems like a bad thing.

00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:02.460
Probably is a bad thing.

00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:07.020
However, we've a very strong foundation
and a very strong framework.

00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:09.980
Let's just look quickly
at the existing laws

00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:12.380
and regulations in the United States.

00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:14.980
Of course, we have the Americans
with Disabilities Act.

00:14:15.140 --> 00:14:19.780
There's two components of that,
that we can all put in our pocket

00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:21.140
while we're talking about the law.

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:25.860
One of them is that the ADA
is an anti-discrimination law.

00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:32.460
Its foundation is you can't discriminate
against disabled people.

00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:36.740
Second, it's a law
that requires effective communication.

00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:40.340
When we're talking about the web,
inaccessibility,

00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:44.500
of course discriminates,
because people who have disabilities

00:14:44.620 --> 00:14:48.100
can't participate
in all these other things we talked about.

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:53.460
Effective communication,
what is web and technology about?

00:14:53.580 --> 00:14:55.100
It's about communicating.

00:14:55.220 --> 00:14:59.780
That is why, even though the ADA
was passed over 30 years ago,

00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:04.820
since almost the very beginning,
the law has recognized

00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:09.140
that the ADA applies
to the digital space.

00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:11.180
I don't really have time to do this,

00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:16.220
but I just love this quote
from 1996, 1996,

00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:22.060
where someone asked Senator
Tom Harkin in the United States

00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:25.300
about the ADA and digital.

00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:32.300
Someone asked Tom Harkin,
and Tom Harkin asked the Department of Justice,

00:15:32.460 --> 00:15:33.700
and the Department of Justice,

00:15:33.940 --> 00:15:38.460
which is the administrative agency
in charge of the ADA primarily,

00:15:38.940 --> 00:15:40.660
the Department of Justice said,

00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:44.700
"Covered entities
under the ADA are required

00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:48.220
to provide effective communication," in 1996.

00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:52.860
Regardless of whether
they generally communicate through print media,

00:15:53.020 --> 00:15:57.860
audio media, or computerized media,
such as the internet,

00:15:58.300 --> 00:16:03.700
covered entities that use the internet
for communications about programs,

00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:08.340
goods, or services, must be prepared
to offer those communications

00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:10.180
through accessible means as well.

00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:12.220
Since 1996.

00:16:12.340 --> 00:16:15.620
This is why the ADA,
even without regulations,

00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:18.940
has been such a strong proponent for accessibility.

00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:21.380
We have Section 504 and 508.

00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:22.980
We can also put that in the pocket.

00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:26.980
Section 504 is just about
federal government's going to spend money.

00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:31.420
It can't give money to organizations
that discriminate against disabled people.

00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:34.740
Section 508, federal government's
going to buy things,

00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:36.420
it has to buy accessible.

00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:39.260
That's why 508 is basically
a procurement law

00:16:39.420 --> 00:16:42.500
as well as a law that protects
the rights of disabled people

00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:45.700
to work in the federal government
with accessible technology.

00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:48.740
The Communication Video Accessibility Act

00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:50.860
and the Federal Communications Commission,

00:16:51.020 --> 00:16:55.220
that's about captioning
and audio description.

00:16:55.380 --> 00:16:56.780
There's lots of rules about that,

00:16:56.900 --> 00:16:58.340
but again, the bottom line is,

00:16:58.820 --> 00:17:03.940
are disabled people going to be able
to participate in communication technology?

00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:07.100
Or are they going to be excluded
on the other side of the bridge?

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:10.460
The Air Carriers Access Act,
special law for airlines,

00:17:10.620 --> 00:17:14.580
also requires accessible websites
as well as kiosks.

00:17:14.780 --> 00:17:17.220
The Affordable Care Act, the ACA,

00:17:17.420 --> 00:17:24.300
Section 1557 is about accessibility
in health care technology

00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:26.220
covered by the Affordable Care Act.

00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:30.620
That's the big framework
of existing federal laws and regulations.

00:17:30.820 --> 00:17:32.580
For each law, there's a lot of regulations.

00:17:32.740 --> 00:17:34.540
I don't have time to get into it.

00:17:34.740 --> 00:17:37.140
I just want to do a,
not even a deep dive,

00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:41.820
a somewhat shallow dive into
the brand new ADA Web and Mobile Rule,

00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:45.740
which just was finalized in April of this year.

00:17:47.140 --> 00:17:51.940
I use the word regulations,
sometimes in the US, they're called rules.

00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:54.980
Rules, regulations,
kind of the same thing.

00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:59.300
The new ADA Web
and Mobile Rule is a rule

00:17:59.420 --> 00:18:03.740
that applies to state
and local governments only.

00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:06.940
I know a lot of you work
in state and local governments.

00:18:07.060 --> 00:18:08.420
It's not just the state or the city.

00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:11.020
It's any program of states and cities.

00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:14.180
I put up a few pictures here
of a county jail

00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:17.180
or a state university
or my hometown library,

00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:18.660
the Berkeley Public Library,

00:18:18.820 --> 00:18:22.220
a park system where I have
a picture here of someone

00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:24.580
in a power wheelchair on an accessible path,

00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:27.420
so all state and local governments.

00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:30.860
People often ask me,
"Is it going to apply to private sector next?"

00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:35.140
It took 14 years
to get these regulations

00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:37.620
and the whole history of it
you can read about on my website.

00:18:37.780 --> 00:18:41.060
The fact they did state
and local government doesn't mean,

00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:44.220
oh, tomorrow they're going
to do private sector.

00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:47.900
However, it does mean
that we got that out of the way,

00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:49.900
we can now focus on private sector.

00:18:50.060 --> 00:18:55.500
The standard is Web Content
Accessibility Guidelines 2.1 AA.

00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:59.420
The timeframe depends
on the size of the state

00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:01.300
or local government organization.

00:19:01.460 --> 00:19:08.700
If it's over 49,999 people,
basically if it's 50,000 people or more,

00:19:08.860 --> 00:19:12.380
then the deadline is April 2026.

00:19:12.620 --> 00:19:19.940
If it's less than that,
if it's a smaller organization, it's April 2027.

00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:22.700
Recognizing that it takes time
to do these things.

00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:26.660
It's important to remember in the timeframe
that the ADA is not suspended.

00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:29.300
Accessibility is still required.

00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:32.860
The Department of Justice
has a very good fact sheet on this.

00:19:33.020 --> 00:19:38.220
If you look up fact sheet,
Department of Justice, Web Accessibility,

00:19:38.340 --> 00:19:42.020
State and Local Government,
you can do that on my website

00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:44.780
or do it on Google,
you get the fact sheet.

00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:47.860
That has all the details
that they say in there.

00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:49.300
The ADA isn't suspended.

00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:51.300
Just recently in the past year,

00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:53.740
the Department
of Justice did a settlement

00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:57.340
with the whole state of Oklahoma
because their mobile app

00:19:57.500 --> 00:20:00.940
that allowed you to put your ID
onto the app wasn't accessible.

00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:04.980
ADA is still chugging along
while these regulations come into play.

00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:06.900
What's covered?

00:20:07.060 --> 00:20:08.580
It's web and mobile only.

00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:10.020
It doesn't apply to anything else.

00:20:10.220 --> 00:20:12.540
Pretty much everything on web and mobile.

00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:15.380
A really important thing
that they call out is,

00:20:16.660 --> 00:20:19.900
if you're a library and you say
you're buying something for your website,

00:20:20.060 --> 00:20:21.940
or you're hiring a third-party developer,

00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:26.620
the state and local government agency
is still responsible.

00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:29.220
You can't get off the hook by saying,
"I didn't build it.

00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:30.140
I hired someone to build it."

00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:31.460
There are some exceptions.

00:20:31.660 --> 00:20:33.260
They're very narrowly drawn.

00:20:33.340 --> 00:20:36.060
These are all in the fact sheet.

00:20:36.180 --> 00:20:40.500
Just one quick example
is social media is covered.

00:20:42.340 --> 00:20:46.500
There's no requirement to go back
and make old social media posts accessible.

00:20:46.700 --> 00:20:51.860
There's no requirement also to go back
and make individual documents.

00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:56.340
They particularly call out
like word processing documents,

00:20:56.500 --> 00:21:00.500
PDFs, spreadsheets,
those kind of static documents,

00:21:00.620 --> 00:21:04.620
no need to go back,
but still, the ADA still applies.

00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:07.660
If you're an agency,
you need to have a plan in place

00:21:07.820 --> 00:21:10.740
to make particular things
that might be in the exceptions,

00:21:10.860 --> 00:21:12.180
to make them accessible too.

00:21:12.340 --> 00:21:15.140
That's this new rule.

00:21:15.260 --> 00:21:17.140
There's a lot about it on the web.

00:21:17.260 --> 00:21:19.900
I encourage you
to take a look at it.

00:21:20.060 --> 00:21:24.060
Beyond regulation,
the United States federal government

00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:26.220
can do things that explain the law.

00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:30.860
I have a picture here
to represent telehealth.

00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:32.420
It's a Black medical professional.

00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:33.900
She's writing notes,

00:21:33.980 --> 00:21:37.020
and the guy on the screen looks
like he has a flu or something,

00:21:37.140 --> 00:21:41.020
which is to illustrate the fact
that the Department of Justice and Health

00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:44.660
and Human Services,
they have really good guidance on telehealth

00:21:44.780 --> 00:21:47.780
and how that needs
to be accessible and health care in general.

00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:50.540
The DOJ and the EEOC,

00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:55.740
which is the Employment Federal Agency
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission,

00:21:55.900 --> 00:21:59.540
they have a really great guidance
on AI hiring tools

00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:04.620
and the risk
to disabled people if disability rights

00:22:04.820 --> 00:22:08.660
and civil rights aren't considered
when using AI hiring tools.

00:22:08.820 --> 00:22:13.220
President Biden has issued executive orders
on AI that include disability.

00:22:13.340 --> 00:22:16.460
The Department of Education,
Department of Justice,

00:22:16.580 --> 00:22:19.780
have what they call
a Dear Colleague letter, which is guidance,

00:22:19.940 --> 00:22:21.580
I don't know why they call it that.

00:22:21.660 --> 00:22:23.660
I don't think anyone else
in the federal government does,

00:22:23.820 --> 00:22:27.540
but it's all about
the importance of accessibility,

00:22:27.700 --> 00:22:31.580
digital inclusion for disabled people
in the higher ed space.

00:22:31.700 --> 00:22:36.140
I have articles on all these things,

00:22:36.300 --> 00:22:41.020
except for that President Biden's AI order,
which is on my to-do list.

00:22:41.180 --> 00:22:43.900
I have articles that link
to all these things on my website.

00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:48.060
I encourage you to check those out
if you're in that sector or you're interested.

00:22:48.380 --> 00:22:50.700
I have to say one other quick thing here.

00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:54.780
These federal agencies,
they are not buildings.

00:22:54.940 --> 00:22:57.860
The people who work
in them are not robots.

00:22:58.020 --> 00:23:02.820
As probably all over the world,
but especially in the US,

00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:06.100
know that we have
a very important election coming up

00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:09.260
in less than a month,
and all of this work,

00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:14.380
you notice the dates up here,
they're at 2022 and 2023.

00:23:14.580 --> 00:23:17.300
Not only would it be my guess

00:23:17.460 --> 00:23:23.060
that it won't continue
if Harris-Walz doesn't win,

00:23:23.220 --> 00:23:26.220
but these can all be rolled back
because the head

00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:28.780
of all these agencies
are appointed by the president.

00:23:28.940 --> 00:23:32.140
It's really important
we talk about the law in the abstract,

00:23:32.300 --> 00:23:35.140
but it's actual people
doing the actual work,

00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:38.220
and the heads of all these agencies
have been appointed

00:23:38.380 --> 00:23:39.980
by President Biden.

00:23:40.140 --> 00:23:45.980
Keep that in mind
when it comes time to voting.

00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:47.940
Back to the framework.

00:23:48.100 --> 00:23:49.300
We have that framework.

00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:51.020
That's the federal framework.

00:23:51.100 --> 00:23:53.460
There's also laws in individual states,

00:23:53.900 --> 00:23:55.100
which is why I put an image here,

00:23:55.220 --> 00:23:57.180
that shows the 50 states in different colors

00:23:57.300 --> 00:23:58.900
because every state has different laws.

00:23:59.060 --> 00:24:02.740
You need to pay attention,
not just to the state

00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:07.540
that your organization works in,
but to the whole country.

00:24:07.740 --> 00:24:08.860
If you have a website,

00:24:08.980 --> 00:24:14.820
it's not going to just be available
in Kentucky or California.

00:24:14.940 --> 00:24:16.300
It's going to be available everywhere.

00:24:16.420 --> 00:24:19.060
It's important to meet the highest standard.

00:24:19.180 --> 00:24:22.220
Again, this is not legal advice,
but that is what I recommend.

00:24:22.420 --> 00:24:27.620
One sort of hot topic is, can you file
a lawsuit about a web-only business?

00:24:27.780 --> 00:24:29.820
You'll see if you're on social media,

00:24:29.980 --> 00:24:33.860
there was a recent case last week
where a court in New York said,

00:24:33.980 --> 00:24:36.980
"In this court,
you can no longer file web-only."

00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:40.020
It has to be connected
in some way to a physical space.

00:24:40.220 --> 00:24:42.180
Like, you have a retail store,

00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:45.140
and you go online
to see what's available,

00:24:45.260 --> 00:24:48.260
then you go to the store,
but that's not the case all over the country.

00:24:48.460 --> 00:24:52.900
Other parts of the country, the courts say,
"You can have web-only."

00:24:53.020 --> 00:24:55.100
That's been since 2012,

00:24:55.260 --> 00:24:58.780
when there was advocacy
around Netflix captioning,

00:24:58.980 --> 00:25:02.140
and a court there said,
"Yes, ADA requires captioning.

00:25:02.620 --> 00:25:04.940
Netflix doesn't have to have a physical place."

00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:07.340
It's important to know about the state laws.

00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:09.900
There's many laws
that have anti-discrimination,

00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:12.180
just like the ADA.

00:25:12.340 --> 00:25:14.500
There's the same thing, state-funded,

00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:18.460
state's going to fund something,
can't discriminate against disabled people.

00:25:18.620 --> 00:25:21.500
State's going to buy technology,
needs to be accessible.

00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:24.140
There's state agency requirements.

00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:27.620
There's a great new law,
relatively new in Maryland,

00:25:27.820 --> 00:25:29.140
which I think is the only one there.

00:25:29.260 --> 00:25:31.860
Someone could maybe put
in the chat if they know of a different one,

00:25:32.020 --> 00:25:37.820
about the requirement to purchase
accessible technology for K-12 education.

00:25:38.020 --> 00:25:39.500
That's in Maryland.

00:25:39.620 --> 00:25:44.940
You can find more information
about all these state laws

00:25:45.060 --> 00:25:47.340
in the Global Law and Policy page
on my website,

00:25:47.380 --> 00:25:50.260
because part of the globe is the US.

00:25:50.340 --> 00:25:55.660
I have a section on state laws
with links to these various state laws.

00:25:55.820 --> 00:25:58.820
You can find that on the top navigation bar.

00:25:59.020 --> 00:26:02.420
It says Legal Update,
there's a dropdown, Global Law and Policy.

00:26:02.540 --> 00:26:05.140
I've also written some articles
about it on the site too.

00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:07.500
What about globally?

00:26:08.100 --> 00:26:09.780
I wish we had three times the time,

00:26:09.900 --> 00:26:12.580
but you have such an exciting program
for the next 24 hours,

00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:13.860
I'm going to stick to my time.

00:26:14.020 --> 00:26:18.580
All I can say about global is this,
accessibility is global.

00:26:18.740 --> 00:26:27.260
I have a page on my website,
which is LFLegal.com/global-law-and-policy/,

00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:30.900
which is the one I just mentioned,
available from the dropdown menu.

00:26:31.100 --> 00:26:33.780
I want to give two shout-outs about this page.

00:26:33.980 --> 00:26:38.260
First let me say, I have countries listed by region

00:26:38.420 --> 00:26:44.580
with digital accessibility laws
or policies related to those countries.

00:26:44.740 --> 00:26:46.260
Of course, I don't have all the countries,

00:26:46.460 --> 00:26:47.820
but I have to give two shout-outs.

00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:51.340
First is to my web developer,
Natalie MacLees,

00:26:51.500 --> 00:26:55.020
who you will be hearing from
as a speaker later today,

00:26:55.140 --> 00:26:57.980
and is one of the founders
of WordPress Accessibility Day.

00:26:58.100 --> 00:27:04.180
I am so lucky and blessed
that she is my web developer for many years,

00:27:04.300 --> 00:27:06.300
also made my beautiful slide template.

00:27:06.420 --> 00:27:09.820
Natalie built me on the back end
of my WordPress site

00:27:09.900 --> 00:27:13.860
a really easy way for me
to put in a country, put in the region,

00:27:13.980 --> 00:27:16.540
put in what the laws are, press go,

00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:19.340
and it populates
on this global accessibility page,

00:27:19.420 --> 00:27:21.180
which is good because I can make changes

00:27:21.340 --> 00:27:24.980
and I can do it all myself,
even though I'm not a tech person.

00:27:25.420 --> 00:27:28.900
The other shout-out for this page
goes to more than 35 people

00:27:29.060 --> 00:27:31.860
who sent me the information you will find.

00:27:32.060 --> 00:27:34.820
We mentioned India, the lawyers

00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:37.860
from Mission Accessibility
sent me that information.

00:27:37.980 --> 00:27:42.500
In France, where I just spoke
at Paris Web, Julie Moynat,

00:27:42.660 --> 00:27:45.980
who's an accessibility person in France,

00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:47.500
she sent me the French information.

00:27:47.620 --> 00:27:50.500
I encourage you,
if you don't see your country on there,

00:27:50.620 --> 00:27:53.340
please, if there's anything
that should be included,

00:27:53.460 --> 00:27:54.580
I hope you will send it to me.

00:27:54.780 --> 00:27:59.860
If you see a mistake,
you see something missing, please let me know.

00:28:00.020 --> 00:28:02.180
I was really glad to do this page.

00:28:03.460 --> 00:28:08.180
I'm glad to keep it going
as long as we can.

00:28:08.620 --> 00:28:13.580
What about the remedies
if the law is ignored?

00:28:14.140 --> 00:28:15.060
Have a cup of tea.

00:28:15.220 --> 00:28:16.300
That's a remedy for a cold.

00:28:16.460 --> 00:28:18.060
Laws include remedies too.

00:28:20.500 --> 00:28:22.660
Different laws have different remedies,

00:28:22.820 --> 00:28:25.860
but that framework
includes the remedies.

00:28:26.020 --> 00:28:30.900
Many laws require you
to fix barriers and fix systems.

00:28:31.060 --> 00:28:33.180
You could end up with court oversight.

00:28:33.340 --> 00:28:35.380
In the United States,
the Department of Justice

00:28:35.540 --> 00:28:38.220
can issue penalties up
to $150,000.

00:28:38.340 --> 00:28:40.740
Honestly, they don't do it
very often, but they can.

00:28:40.940 --> 00:28:44.940
You might have to get involved
in the wrong side of a lawsuit,

00:28:45.060 --> 00:28:46.580
you might have to pay the disabled person,

00:28:46.780 --> 00:28:49.540
you might have to pay their lawyers
or your own lawyers.

00:28:49.700 --> 00:28:53.460
In the European Accessibility Act,
there are potential fines.

00:28:53.620 --> 00:28:58.700
There's market loss,
there's potential jail time.

00:28:58.820 --> 00:29:05.060
I switched the picture
from the teacup to a keyboard

00:29:05.220 --> 00:29:07.660
with keys that say Reactive
and Proactive.

00:29:07.820 --> 00:29:11.460
We may as well be proactive
and fix the barriers,

00:29:11.620 --> 00:29:14.220
because you're going
to have to fix the barriers

00:29:14.340 --> 00:29:16.700
if you get involved
on the wrong side of a lawsuit.

00:29:16.820 --> 00:29:19.420
You could tell your developers,
tell your clients that,

00:29:19.580 --> 00:29:22.500
and you get all this other stuff,
but if you fix the barriers,

00:29:22.620 --> 00:29:25.900
you don't get the court oversight
and the penalties and lawyer feeds.

00:29:26.060 --> 00:29:29.580
Fixing the barriers, I should say building a system

00:29:29.700 --> 00:29:32.620
that's accessible to begin with,
super important.

00:29:32.820 --> 00:29:37.380
Without implementation
of all this framework,

00:29:38.300 --> 00:29:40.340
the cookie dough is still unbaked.

00:29:40.540 --> 00:29:42.860
How does implementation happen?

00:29:43.020 --> 00:29:46.380
Implementation,
how are laws implemented?

00:29:46.580 --> 00:29:47.580
Who and how?

00:29:47.740 --> 00:29:51.340
I have an image here of a student speaking

00:29:51.500 --> 00:29:55.100
in sign language because first of all,

00:29:55.260 --> 00:29:59.340
in the United States,
and this is true all around the world,

00:29:59.460 --> 00:30:02.780
I think, people with disabilities
are enforcing these laws all the time.

00:30:02.940 --> 00:30:04.140
Not with lawsuits,

00:30:04.300 --> 00:30:08.140
not even with kinder gentler
structured negotiation collaboration,

00:30:08.340 --> 00:30:16.300
but by filing feedback
and communicating with site owners.

00:30:16.700 --> 00:30:19.140
They're not saying
there's a WCAG violation.

00:30:19.300 --> 00:30:21.980
They're not saying
that there's a legal violation.

00:30:22.140 --> 00:30:23.420
They're saying, "I can't find something.

00:30:23.580 --> 00:30:25.220
I don't see something.

00:30:25.380 --> 00:30:26.820
I can't locate.

00:30:26.980 --> 00:30:30.940
I don't know how to get there."
If you have any way of feedback,

00:30:31.340 --> 00:30:34.860
a feedback loop that really works
in your organizations

00:30:35.020 --> 00:30:36.540
and recommending to your clients,

00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:39.980
so important because
that is the first way the laws enforce

00:30:40.100 --> 00:30:44.180
and can maybe get you away
from having to get into other enforcement.

00:30:44.300 --> 00:30:47.980
Also, the government agencies,
there's private party lawsuits

00:30:48.100 --> 00:30:48.980
in the United States,

00:30:49.140 --> 00:30:52.060
I don't have a lot of time
to go into the fact

00:30:52.220 --> 00:30:56.340
that I think some of those lawsuits right now
are not ethical lawsuits,

00:30:56.460 --> 00:30:57.740
which we'll talk about in a minute,

00:30:57.860 --> 00:31:00.380
but there still are ethical lawsuits

00:31:00.500 --> 00:31:06.500
that disability civil rights lawyers use
to enforce the framework we talked about.

00:31:06.620 --> 00:31:08.300
Then Structured Negotiation,

00:31:08.420 --> 00:31:10.900
if you're interested in Structured Negotiation,

00:31:11.100 --> 00:31:15.500
like I think Amber said in the intro,
I have written a book about it.

00:31:15.660 --> 00:31:16.860
It's not just for lawyers.

00:31:17.020 --> 00:31:19.460
It's available all over the world in English.

00:31:19.620 --> 00:31:21.260
It's supposed to be available in Spanish soon.

00:31:23.380 --> 00:31:25.580
On my website,
in the Settlements tab,

00:31:25.700 --> 00:31:29.860
you can see most of the cases
that I worked on in the past many years.

00:31:30.020 --> 00:31:33.660
In the European Union,
I'm very excited about how enforcement

00:31:33.740 --> 00:31:37.700
is going to go
when the laws come online.

00:31:37.860 --> 00:31:42.300
They're online, but when
the implementation date starts in 2025,

00:31:42.460 --> 00:31:44.420
because you have
a surveillance authority,

00:31:44.580 --> 00:31:46.340
mainstream's accessibility,

00:31:46.460 --> 00:31:48.820
like you can't put unsafe things in a market,

00:31:48.900 --> 00:31:51.420
can't put inaccessible things
in a market.

00:31:51.580 --> 00:31:54.300
There's enforcement
through self-declaration

00:31:54.460 --> 00:31:56.620
and through advocate complaints.

00:31:56.780 --> 00:31:59.180
Globally, this is different in every country.

00:31:59.300 --> 00:32:02.540
I encourage you to know how
the laws are enforced in your country.

00:32:02.660 --> 00:32:05.620
Again, if you see it missing
on my page, please send it to me.

00:32:06.060 --> 00:32:08.260
What are some of my favorite US actions?

00:32:08.460 --> 00:32:10.220
Got the fireworks going.

00:32:10.340 --> 00:32:14.100
Education,
there's a lot of good things going on.

00:32:14.260 --> 00:32:18.980
I have a picture here
of a woman who's listening

00:32:19.100 --> 00:32:23.180
to a speaker with her iPhone
and her computer in large print.

00:32:23.380 --> 00:32:27.820
There was a verdict against
Los Angeles Community College District

00:32:27.940 --> 00:32:31.780
of $240,000 for not providing
accessible information.

00:32:31.900 --> 00:32:33.500
This is on my website too.

00:32:33.660 --> 00:32:35.820
There's a lot of settlements with universities

00:32:35.900 --> 00:32:39.620
that you can look at as a roadmap
for what the Department of Justice

00:32:39.780 --> 00:32:41.220
and private parties require.

00:32:41.420 --> 00:32:46.380
There's cases about continuing
ed accessibility, state licensing exams,

00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:49.940
Department of Education
does civil rights complaints.

00:32:50.100 --> 00:32:52.100
There's a great resource.

00:32:52.260 --> 00:32:55.780
If you put in higher
ed accessibility lawsuit tracker

00:32:55.940 --> 00:33:00.060
or higher ed accessibility lawsuits,

00:33:00.180 --> 00:33:03.780
you will find a resource
from Laura Carlson at University of Minnesota

00:33:03.940 --> 00:33:07.660
that I rely on to find out
what's happening in the education space.

00:33:07.820 --> 00:33:10.700
There's a lot of good happening
in the education space,

00:33:10.860 --> 00:33:12.620
a lot of good happening in voting,

00:33:12.740 --> 00:33:16.340
both Department of Justice
and private parties are using the ADA

00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:20.140
in the way it exists now
to make sure disabled people can vote,

00:33:20.860 --> 00:33:23.740
which needless to say, very important.

00:33:24.580 --> 00:33:27.820
A couple cases where that
whole framework I talked to you about,

00:33:27.980 --> 00:33:31.940
that's within a bigger
ecosystem of US law.

00:33:32.100 --> 00:33:33.500
There's a couple of examples

00:33:33.660 --> 00:33:35.940
I just want to share really quickly where people

00:33:36.060 --> 00:33:40.460
are using non-disability law
to advance digital accessibility.

00:33:40.620 --> 00:33:43.300
One of my favorites is this one,
which I titled the slide,

00:33:43.460 --> 00:33:45.220
don't lie about accessibility.

00:33:45.700 --> 00:33:48.860
Picture is a woman holding
$100 bills on fire.

00:33:49.060 --> 00:33:52.940
This was a case against
California parks system

00:33:53.100 --> 00:33:56.580
because a website
was supposed to be accessible,

00:33:56.700 --> 00:33:57.860
it was in the contract,

00:33:57.940 --> 00:34:01.780
the developer handed it over
to the state and said,

00:34:01.900 --> 00:34:04.540
"This is accessible," but it was not.

00:34:04.740 --> 00:34:08.860
That website,
it was for a park system and reservation.

00:34:09.020 --> 00:34:14.460
The price of it fluctuated, but it potentially
could have been over $5 million.

00:34:14.660 --> 00:34:16.860
They paid for this website
that was inaccessible.

00:34:17.060 --> 00:34:21.060
There's a law in the United States
usually used in military context,

00:34:21.180 --> 00:34:24.340
like military contractors sell something

00:34:24.460 --> 00:34:27.460
and lie about the cost
called the False Claims Act.

00:34:27.580 --> 00:34:30.060
That's what Blind Advocates did to say,

00:34:30.180 --> 00:34:33.740
"Hey, you've lied to the parks department.

00:34:33.900 --> 00:34:35.220
This site is not accessible."

00:34:35.380 --> 00:34:39.100
The contractor and the web developer
and the subcontractor were sued.

00:34:39.260 --> 00:34:43.180
It was recently resolved
for $2 million and fixing the barriers.

00:34:43.340 --> 00:34:46.860
Back to the proactive-reactive,
if they had fixed the barriers,

00:34:47.060 --> 00:34:48.980
if they had a procurement process

00:34:49.140 --> 00:34:52.380
that didn't allow broken things
into the system.

00:34:52.540 --> 00:34:58.500
Procurement is so critical
to digital accessibility generally

00:34:58.620 --> 00:34:59.500
and in the legal space.

00:34:59.700 --> 00:35:01.180
If they had had that in place,

00:35:01.340 --> 00:35:03.540
they wouldn't have had to do
all these other things.

00:35:03.660 --> 00:35:05.420
Another one, be fair and honest.

00:35:05.900 --> 00:35:09.340
This is a case called Tribeca Skin
Care vs. AccessiBe,

00:35:09.460 --> 00:35:10.540
which is an overlay company.

00:35:10.660 --> 00:35:14.140
Many of you are familiar
with the overlay fact sheet

00:35:14.260 --> 00:35:16.020
and problems with overlays.

00:35:16.180 --> 00:35:17.180
I'll just leave it at that.

00:35:17.300 --> 00:35:21.740
I've been very vocal about that
in my writing and speaking.

00:35:22.300 --> 00:35:24.780
For here, you just need
to know that a lawsuit

00:35:24.900 --> 00:35:27.580
was filed by a small business
who bought the overlay,

00:35:27.780 --> 00:35:30.340
used it for two years,
paid the licensing fee,

00:35:30.460 --> 00:35:33.140
and then got a lawsuit because
their site wasn't accessible.

00:35:33.300 --> 00:35:36.620
They hired a lawyer to file
a business case.

00:35:36.780 --> 00:35:39.220
These are disability rights lawyers,

00:35:39.380 --> 00:35:42.260
I've since met them
and they seem great.

00:35:42.420 --> 00:35:43.220
I love this case.

00:35:43.380 --> 00:35:45.220
They filed a breach of contract,

00:35:45.380 --> 00:35:47.300
a breach of good faith
and fair dealing.

00:35:47.420 --> 00:35:49.740
I've written about this case on my website,

00:35:49.860 --> 00:35:51.860
which is basically to say don't lie.

00:35:52.060 --> 00:35:54.140
Like we just said, don't lie about accessibility.

00:35:54.300 --> 00:35:56.740
Be honest in your transactions.

00:35:56.860 --> 00:35:59.660
Be clear about what you're providing

00:35:59.860 --> 00:36:02.340
and provide what you say
you're going to provide.

00:36:02.500 --> 00:36:05.620
This is a case that we all really need
to watch because it's the,

00:36:05.780 --> 00:36:13.420
I think, biggest potential case to put a halt

00:36:13.540 --> 00:36:15.500
or slow down the overlay problem.

00:36:15.620 --> 00:36:18.540
Beyond websites,
the law is doing a lot of things.

00:36:18.660 --> 00:36:21.500
Kiosks, VR captioning.

00:36:21.660 --> 00:36:23.260
I have pictures of health care kiosks.

00:36:23.420 --> 00:36:24.660
There's settlements about that.

00:36:24.820 --> 00:36:27.340
There's a VR captioning case
that was settled.

00:36:27.460 --> 00:36:31.140
There's a case pending
about podcast transcripts.

00:36:31.260 --> 00:36:35.300
This is all under the ADA,
under the non-discrimination

00:36:35.500 --> 00:36:37.380
and the effective communication.

00:36:37.500 --> 00:36:39.900
Those things we can
just put in our pocket

00:36:40.020 --> 00:36:42.700
to talk about the ADA
in a way that centers people.

00:36:42.860 --> 00:36:49.100
I have a resource on my website
called Kiosks, the law is paying attention.

00:36:49.220 --> 00:36:52.540
I've kept it for many years,
and every time there's a kiosk case,

00:36:52.740 --> 00:36:56.780
and there's also kiosk resources
I put it in that article.

00:36:56.900 --> 00:36:58.340
I invite you to look at that.

00:36:58.460 --> 00:37:02.620
Least favorite parts of the US legal landscape,
you can probably guess.

00:37:02.780 --> 00:37:04.340
One is the numbers.

00:37:04.460 --> 00:37:13.100
The lawsuits for 2023,
there were 4,605 digital accessibility cases filed,

00:37:13.260 --> 00:37:16.180
primarily web
and mobile, mostly web.

00:37:16.340 --> 00:37:19.020
25 of the cases against
defendants already sued.

00:37:19.180 --> 00:37:23.020
933 against companies using an overlay.

00:37:23.140 --> 00:37:26.020
UsableNet is a consultancy
that does the numbers.

00:37:26.180 --> 00:37:27.220
They do monthly reports.

00:37:27.380 --> 00:37:30.300
I don't have any way
to double-check it,

00:37:30.460 --> 00:37:33.740
but as far as I can tell,
these numbers are accurate.

00:37:33.900 --> 00:37:38.460
I don't like all these cases
because it takes accessibility

00:37:38.580 --> 00:37:43.660
and the law out of the realm
of people, out of disabled people,

00:37:43.780 --> 00:37:45.220
and it encourages fear.

00:37:45.420 --> 00:37:49.300
I think it also encourages
the overlays because people get scared,

00:37:49.420 --> 00:37:51.620
understandably,
so they're going to get sued,

00:37:51.740 --> 00:37:53.660
they look for a quick fix,
they go to the overlay.

00:37:54.380 --> 00:37:56.380
That's the other part.

00:37:56.500 --> 00:37:59.020
Overlays and SLAPP,
I have a picture of Darth Vader,

00:37:59.220 --> 00:38:02.980
because this is the dark side
of digital accessibility right now.

00:38:03.140 --> 00:38:06.700
There have been cases against
accessibility advocates both

00:38:06.820 --> 00:38:07.900
in the United States and France.

00:38:08.060 --> 00:38:10.140
Fortunately, the one in the United States

00:38:10.260 --> 00:38:12.100
against Adrian Roselli has settled.

00:38:12.300 --> 00:38:14.820
One of the French ones has,
one hasn't.

00:38:15.020 --> 00:38:18.380
If you don't know the overlay fact sheet,
please take a look at it.

00:38:18.540 --> 00:38:20.660
What might happen in the next two years?

00:38:20.820 --> 00:38:23.100
What might happen in the next two years?

00:38:23.540 --> 00:38:25.420
First of all, the answer is nothing,

00:38:25.580 --> 00:38:32.620
because if Donald Trump gets elected
and the Project 2025 blueprint

00:38:32.740 --> 00:38:35.300
for conservative presidency
gets implemented,

00:38:35.460 --> 00:38:36.740
we're not going to see anything.

00:38:36.900 --> 00:38:39.740
We're going to see rollback,
we're not going to see new laws.

00:38:40.820 --> 00:38:44.540
Again, Project 2025,
if you're not familiar with it,

00:38:44.660 --> 00:38:48.580
I have an article on my website
about the impact of Project 2025

00:38:48.740 --> 00:38:50.140
on people with disabilities.

00:38:50.300 --> 00:38:52.860
As I said, it's a blueprint written
by conservatives,

00:38:53.060 --> 00:38:54.620
the right wing in the United States.

00:38:54.780 --> 00:38:56.060
I encourage you to look at it.

00:38:56.220 --> 00:38:59.980
Everything's looking good
for Kamala Harris.

00:39:00.100 --> 00:39:04.580
Let's assume she does get elected,
what might happen in the next two years?

00:39:04.740 --> 00:39:07.740
There's a couple of accessibility laws out there.

00:39:07.860 --> 00:39:10.940
One is the website
and software app law.

00:39:11.900 --> 00:39:14.940
It's been pending since the fall of 2022.

00:39:15.900 --> 00:39:19.500
There's a Communications
Video Technology Accessibility Act

00:39:19.700 --> 00:39:21.700
to upgrade, the CVTA.

00:39:21.900 --> 00:39:23.300
One thing about the website law

00:39:23.420 --> 00:39:30.980
is it specifically obligates
developers to meet the standards.

00:39:31.140 --> 00:39:33.780
The way the ADA works,
you only can go after the state

00:39:33.980 --> 00:39:37.020
and local government
or the private website owner,

00:39:37.180 --> 00:39:39.100
but they're trying to expand that,

00:39:39.260 --> 00:39:41.660
which is only fair to the developers

00:39:41.780 --> 00:39:46.660
who are delivering the websites
and the technology.

00:39:46.780 --> 00:39:48.180
Those are pending.

00:39:48.300 --> 00:39:51.580
A lot of time is spent
and a lot of words written about laws

00:39:51.660 --> 00:39:52.980
that are pending and what might happen.

00:39:53.100 --> 00:39:56.140
I encourage you to stay up to date.

00:39:56.300 --> 00:39:58.940
That's one of the reasons I do these talks
and write these articles,

00:39:59.100 --> 00:40:02.780
but we can't lose sight of how strong
the framework is already,

00:40:03.220 --> 00:40:05.780
which is why I read you
the quote from 1996.

00:40:05.940 --> 00:40:09.420
There was a California bill that got
so much attention, it never passed.

00:40:09.540 --> 00:40:10.340
It didn't happen.

00:40:10.460 --> 00:40:13.380
It was called California Bill 1757.

00:40:13.500 --> 00:40:17.260
We're talking about what's happening
in the next two years.

00:40:17.420 --> 00:40:19.300
This really isn't underproposed

00:40:19.460 --> 00:40:24.780
because there are European
Accessibility Act country laws,

00:40:25.620 --> 00:40:28.020
but we're going to see
the implementation.

00:40:28.140 --> 00:40:30.460
I'm really excited to see
how that is going

00:40:30.620 --> 00:40:32.780
to play out across the European Union.

00:40:32.940 --> 00:40:36.300
I'm going to be following that
and trying to write more about that.

00:40:36.460 --> 00:40:40.260
Pending impossible accessibility regulations.

00:40:40.700 --> 00:40:42.780
We're supposed to have kiosk regulations.

00:40:42.940 --> 00:40:44.580
We don't have them, but like I said,

00:40:44.740 --> 00:40:47.460
the ADA is chugging
along requiring kiosks.

00:40:47.620 --> 00:40:50.740
The EV, electric vehicle
charging station regs,

00:40:50.900 --> 00:40:52.820
we just put out in draft form.

00:40:52.980 --> 00:40:55.900
The Department of Education
is supposed to update their regs.

00:40:56.340 --> 00:40:58.100
Don't wait, the law is strong.

00:40:58.540 --> 00:41:00.700
I only have three minutes.

00:41:00.860 --> 00:41:03.620
We talked about these things.

00:41:03.780 --> 00:41:08.100
I want to have a little time,
I guess one minute each for--

00:41:08.220 --> 00:41:12.380
Let's talk about the law
in the WordPress developer client contracts.

00:41:12.580 --> 00:41:16.220
This is a place that's really important
to remember, no legal advice.

00:41:16.380 --> 00:41:20.820
I can recommend
that you be very clear in your contracts.

00:41:20.980 --> 00:41:22.220
I'm not telling you what to say,

00:41:22.380 --> 00:41:24.500
but I always think
it's a good idea to be clear

00:41:24.620 --> 00:41:27.900
in your contracts about
what accessibility standard

00:41:28.020 --> 00:41:29.740
is going to be used.

00:41:29.900 --> 00:41:32.420
What testing is going to be accomplished?

00:41:32.580 --> 00:41:33.740
Who's going to do it?

00:41:33.860 --> 00:41:34.900
When's it going to happen?

00:41:35.020 --> 00:41:37.700
What are you saying
about legal compliance?

00:41:37.820 --> 00:41:39.340
What are you promising or not promising?

00:41:39.500 --> 00:41:42.380
What about third-party work
that you don't really control

00:41:42.500 --> 00:41:43.860
but is part of what you're delivering?

00:41:44.020 --> 00:41:46.500
Who's going to fix barriers after the fact?

00:41:48.380 --> 00:41:51.140
The accessibility
and web development contracts

00:41:51.300 --> 00:41:53.660
is a really good article
that alerted me to this,

00:41:53.820 --> 00:41:57.060
that Amber alerted to me to it
as well in her podcast.

00:41:57.260 --> 00:41:59.860
Amber, when you come back on
with the questions,

00:41:59.980 --> 00:42:01.820
please tell people where they can find this.

00:42:01.940 --> 00:42:05.220
It's called accessibility
and web development contracts,

00:42:05.380 --> 00:42:06.500
it's in quotes.

00:42:06.620 --> 00:42:08.100
If you put that in Google, you'll find it,

00:42:08.220 --> 00:42:09.580
but Amber will tell you more.

00:42:09.740 --> 00:42:11.900
Reminder, this is not legal advice.

00:42:12.060 --> 00:42:14.860
How to talk about the law
and digital accessibility.

00:42:15.700 --> 00:42:16.900
Don't be a shark.

00:42:17.020 --> 00:42:18.620
I already told you I don't like sharks.

00:42:18.780 --> 00:42:20.420
I have a big x on the shark.

00:42:20.620 --> 00:42:24.740
We need to use the law
to encourage people that digital accessibility

00:42:24.860 --> 00:42:27.940
is not just the right thing to do,
but it's a required thing,

00:42:28.100 --> 00:42:31.340
but if we approach it with anger, and fear,

00:42:31.500 --> 00:42:35.180
and bloodthirsty
and oh-oh, you're going to get in trouble,

00:42:35.340 --> 00:42:36.420
not motivating.

00:42:36.580 --> 00:42:37.940
I say don't be a shark.

00:42:38.100 --> 00:42:39.740
Be a dolphin instead.

00:42:39.900 --> 00:42:43.300
I like this picture
of the dolphin and the tube.

00:42:43.460 --> 00:42:45.260
They're getting the fish out of the tube.

00:42:45.380 --> 00:42:46.620
If they didn't work together,

00:42:46.780 --> 00:42:48.620
they would not get
the fish out of the tube.

00:42:48.740 --> 00:42:55.940
I offer talks,
actually five-hour trainings

00:42:56.140 --> 00:42:58.700
about what does it really mean
to be collaborative.

00:42:58.940 --> 00:43:03.060
In my 30 seconds,
I'll just say, you've got to really listen.

00:43:03.220 --> 00:43:04.540
You've got to know who you're talking to.

00:43:04.700 --> 00:43:06.420
You've got to speak the language.

00:43:06.580 --> 00:43:08.460
When talking about the law,

00:43:08.620 --> 00:43:11.860
try to talk with ideas about people
instead of fear.

00:43:12.020 --> 00:43:15.340
Talk about civil and human rights,
focusing on people,

00:43:15.500 --> 00:43:19.820
inclusion and exclusion,
privacy and security, diversity,

00:43:19.980 --> 00:43:21.100
inclusion, and belonging.

00:43:21.300 --> 00:43:25.140
We're out of products for all, ethics,
risk mitigation, efficiencies.

00:43:25.300 --> 00:43:27.220
These are all embodied in the law.

00:43:27.660 --> 00:43:30.940
I have an article on my website
called Accessibility is Delicious,

00:43:34.180 --> 00:43:40.020
my clock gave me my 40 minutes,
which is another group article,

00:43:40.180 --> 00:43:43.020
collections from all over
the world that started with,

00:43:43.220 --> 00:43:46.980
you can't put the blueberries
in the muffin once the muffin is baked.

00:43:47.140 --> 00:43:51.140
One of them is this,
a melted ice cream cone.

00:43:51.340 --> 00:43:53.700
Accessibility is like an ice cream cone.

00:43:53.900 --> 00:43:56.060
If you do it late,
it's very messy.

00:43:56.180 --> 00:43:58.220
I'm sure you've
all heard people say,

00:43:58.340 --> 00:43:59.700
"Oh, we'll just do that later,"

00:43:59.860 --> 00:44:02.980
but no, not only is it messy
and not efficient,

00:44:03.140 --> 00:44:05.420
but it's also required by the law.

00:44:05.620 --> 00:44:11.220
I think I'll just stop with the resources,
really recommend the DOJ email list.

00:44:11.740 --> 00:44:15.300
Access Board has an email list,
they do some of these regulations.

00:44:15.740 --> 00:44:19.180
On my social media accounts,
primarily LinkedIn now,

00:44:19.340 --> 00:44:21.540
I have an email list,
hardly ever use it,

00:44:21.660 --> 00:44:23.140
but you're welcome
to sign up and when I do,

00:44:23.260 --> 00:44:26.660
you'll find out things about the law.

00:44:28.260 --> 00:44:32.820
Seyfarth ADA Title III blog
for ethical defense perspective.

00:44:34.460 --> 00:44:36.180
I think I'll stop here.

00:44:36.300 --> 00:44:38.980
A couple more things,
but we'll see how the questions go.

00:44:39.140 --> 00:44:40.140
I want to be respectful.

00:44:40.300 --> 00:44:41.340
Amber, back to you.

00:44:41.980 --> 00:44:42.820
-Great.

00:44:42.940 --> 00:44:43.660
Thank you.

00:44:46.020 --> 00:44:48.020
I'm going to wait just a second
until I-- There we go.

00:44:48.140 --> 00:44:49.140
Hi.

00:44:49.300 --> 00:44:51.380
Thank you so much
for that wonderful presentation

00:44:51.500 --> 00:44:53.340
and for packing so much information in.

00:44:53.500 --> 00:44:57.940
For everyone, Lainey slides
are available on the website

00:44:58.060 --> 00:44:58.860
in the schedule session.

00:44:58.980 --> 00:45:03.780
You can find those if you want access
to any of those resources.

00:45:03.900 --> 00:45:06.140
I did also post a link in the chat

00:45:06.300 --> 00:45:10.620
to the blog post you were referencing
about accessibility and contracts.

00:45:10.740 --> 00:45:14.460
We have a few questions
and we have about six minutes.

00:45:14.900 --> 00:45:19.220
I'm going to try and get us
through those quickly.

00:45:19.420 --> 00:45:25.100
Tom had asked, do you know
what would happen for state

00:45:25.180 --> 00:45:27.180
and local government
under the ADA ruling

00:45:27.300 --> 00:45:31.140
if they're not compliant
by April 2026?

00:45:31.300 --> 00:45:34.620
Is there anything specific to that?

00:45:36.180 --> 00:45:40.580
-The rule is part of the ADA.

00:45:40.740 --> 00:45:46.260
The way the ADA
is enforced, those remedies,

00:45:46.420 --> 00:45:50.580
those will apply through lawsuits,
structured negotiation,

00:45:50.740 --> 00:45:53.140
the Department of Justice
can do investigations.

00:45:53.300 --> 00:45:57.020
They have a whole claims process.

00:45:57.140 --> 00:45:59.940
Disabled people can file claims
with Department of Justice.

00:46:00.100 --> 00:46:01.820
Department of Justice can investigate.

00:46:01.980 --> 00:46:03.300
They can do settlement agreements,

00:46:03.380 --> 00:46:06.220
like I mentioned
with that Oklahoma mobile app case.

00:46:06.380 --> 00:46:09.380
They have done a lot of work
on accessibility for many, many years.

00:46:09.540 --> 00:46:15.780
Whatever the remedies
are in the implementation issues

00:46:15.980 --> 00:46:17.020
for the whole ADA,

00:46:17.180 --> 00:46:21.100
that's going to kick
into effect for the Title II regs.

00:46:21.580 --> 00:46:26.500
-Susan had asked,
are there state and local laws

00:46:26.620 --> 00:46:28.580
that are more strict than federal laws?

00:46:30.220 --> 00:46:31.780
-That's a very good question,

00:46:31.900 --> 00:46:34.020
something that got lost
in having to go too fast.

00:46:34.140 --> 00:46:39.380
One big difference
is that the remedies for the Americans

00:46:39.460 --> 00:46:43.140
with Disabilities Act
include fixing the problem,

00:46:43.300 --> 00:46:44.540
which is very important, of course,

00:46:44.660 --> 00:46:48.500
as well as paying the lawyers
for the disabled person.

00:46:48.700 --> 00:46:52.900
In the US, usually you have
to pay your own lawyer,

00:46:53.020 --> 00:46:56.660
but in discrimination cases
like race, gender, disability,

00:46:56.740 --> 00:46:59.900
the rule
is that the fee requirement shifts.

00:47:00.060 --> 00:47:01.300
They call it fee shifting.

00:47:01.460 --> 00:47:03.580
If a company discriminates,

00:47:03.700 --> 00:47:07.060
they have to pay the fees
of the lawyer

00:47:07.180 --> 00:47:11.260
for the disabled person,
which is how I--

00:47:11.380 --> 00:47:12.300
That's my business model.

00:47:12.380 --> 00:47:13.500
That's how I've always been paid.

00:47:13.620 --> 00:47:15.100
No person with a disability

00:47:15.260 --> 00:47:16.940
has ever had to pay me because of this.

00:47:18.020 --> 00:47:21.380
Sorry, didn't mean to get distracted.

00:47:21.460 --> 00:47:24.140
In some states, there's also requirements

00:47:24.300 --> 00:47:28.300
that the disabled person
can be paid money.

00:47:28.500 --> 00:47:32.780
One case to watch on this
is one of those kiosk case

00:47:32.900 --> 00:47:35.380
against the checking kiosks.

00:47:35.580 --> 00:47:38.300
I don't remember
if it's Quest or LabCorp.

00:47:38.500 --> 00:47:41.580
That case has been given
the stamp of approval

00:47:41.700 --> 00:47:45.300
to proceed
as a class action in California.

00:47:45.460 --> 00:47:50.500
That means there's a potential
for a lot of money coming out of California.

00:47:50.620 --> 00:47:53.460
The strictness more has to do with money.

00:47:53.620 --> 00:47:57.860
You'll see in the cases most of them
are filed either in California,

00:47:57.980 --> 00:48:00.260
New York, Florida,
where they do have money.

00:48:02.220 --> 00:48:02.820
-Great.

00:48:02.900 --> 00:48:03.660
Thank you.

00:48:04.180 --> 00:48:08.980
Someone said, for the Title II state
and local government requirements,

00:48:09.140 --> 00:48:11.980
I recently heard
that any healthcare organizations

00:48:12.100 --> 00:48:14.620
like physician practices that receive Medicare

00:48:14.740 --> 00:48:15.980
or Medicaid reimbursements,

00:48:16.140 --> 00:48:19.100
must also be accessible
on their websites.

00:48:19.220 --> 00:48:20.180
Is that true?

00:48:20.300 --> 00:48:22.540
My knowledge of this

00:48:22.660 --> 00:48:26.580
is that might also
come from the Affordable Care Act.

00:48:26.740 --> 00:48:29.060
-I was just going to say that.

00:48:29.180 --> 00:48:32.940
That resource
on my website about telehealth,

00:48:33.100 --> 00:48:36.420
if you just search telehealth
on my site search engine

00:48:36.580 --> 00:48:37.500
or through Google,

00:48:37.660 --> 00:48:42.300
it has a lot of that information
about the Affordable Care Act,

00:48:42.500 --> 00:48:45.380
links to the regulations
and the requirements.

00:48:45.540 --> 00:48:48.060
That's where that would be, I think.

00:48:48.220 --> 00:48:50.620
It wouldn't be under Title II

00:48:50.740 --> 00:48:53.620
because Title II only goes
to state or local government.

00:48:53.780 --> 00:48:59.860
Now, of course, if it's a healthcare operation
that's a state agency

00:48:59.980 --> 00:49:03.860
or something, then yes,
but if it's a private doctor

00:49:04.020 --> 00:49:05.660
and they're getting Medicare funding,

00:49:05.780 --> 00:49:11.300
that would either be 504 Health
and Human Service Regulations

00:49:11.500 --> 00:49:12.740
or Affordable Care Act.

00:49:14.100 --> 00:49:18.780
Again, the question
and answer is also no legal advice

00:49:18.900 --> 00:49:20.100
in the questions and answers.

00:49:20.300 --> 00:49:22.660
I've given you my best, but yes.

00:49:22.820 --> 00:49:24.420
-We appreciate it.

00:49:24.580 --> 00:49:32.300
I think we have time
for one more quick question.

00:49:32.500 --> 00:49:37.020
I'll just note someone
did say that they were looking

00:49:37.140 --> 00:49:40.020
for a link to the FAQ document
and they couldn't find it.

00:49:40.180 --> 00:49:42.260
I'm going to hope maybe
that you can stay on

00:49:42.420 --> 00:49:45.420
and just post a link to that
in the chat when you're done,

00:49:45.620 --> 00:49:48.100
if you could do that.

00:49:48.260 --> 00:49:49.700
-Yes, of course.

00:49:49.820 --> 00:49:51.580
-Because they said they're searching
your website and can't find it.

00:49:51.700 --> 00:49:55.540
Do you know if there's current guidance--
Oh, sorry, go ahead.

00:49:55.660 --> 00:49:58.140
-Just real quick, I would look
in Google for a fact sheet.

00:49:58.220 --> 00:49:59.340
I wouldn't look on my website.

00:49:59.460 --> 00:50:03.100
It's linked, but it's complicated.

00:50:03.260 --> 00:50:04.820
There's WordPress, Google it,

00:50:04.980 --> 00:50:07.540
should getting the updates
to show up in the search engine.

00:50:07.700 --> 00:50:09.700
I would look on Google for a fact sheet.

00:50:10.620 --> 00:50:13.260
I will still put it in here,
but look on Google.

00:50:13.420 --> 00:50:17.700
Fact sheet, ADA, DOJ, web access.

00:50:17.860 --> 00:50:18.700
Sorry.

00:50:18.820 --> 00:50:19.660
Go ahead, Amber.

00:50:19.860 --> 00:50:20.580
-Great.

00:50:20.740 --> 00:50:23.620
I actually think that might be our time,

00:50:23.700 --> 00:50:25.660
because we need
to give our captioners

00:50:25.740 --> 00:50:29.260
and our interpreters
a break before our next session.

00:50:29.420 --> 00:50:32.300
Thank you so much, Lainey.

00:50:32.460 --> 00:50:37.620
Feel free to hang around
and answer a few questions

00:50:37.700 --> 00:50:38.580
in the chat if you want,

00:50:38.700 --> 00:50:41.220
or, of course,
anyone can follow up with Lainey.

00:50:41.380 --> 00:50:44.300
She's at LFLegal on socials,

00:50:44.460 --> 00:50:46.740
and you can find her at LFLegal.com.

00:50:46.900 --> 00:50:48.300
-Yes.

00:50:48.380 --> 00:50:52.780
