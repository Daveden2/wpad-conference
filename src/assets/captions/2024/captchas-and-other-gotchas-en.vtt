<v Announcer> WordPress
Accessibility Day 2024

00:00:04.097 --> 00:00:05.817
Captchas and Other Gotchas:

00:00:06.077 --> 00:00:08.617
Make Sure Your Secure Website
is Accessible

00:00:09.057 --> 00:00:10.919
with speaker AmyJune Hineline,

00:00:11.189 --> 00:00:14.369
Certification Community Architect
at the Linux Foundation.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.274
This presentation
was recorded October 2024.

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:22.999
<v Simon Miner> Hey, everybody.

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:29.585
I wanted to welcome you
to WordPress Accessibility Day 2024.

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.728
My name is Simon Miner,
and I'm the founder

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:34.770
and CEO of Pedal Point Solutions.

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.280
If I'm looking away like this,
I'm not being rude.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.229
It's just that I have low vision
and a big monitor with text over here.

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.289
I want to thank you all for joining us

00:00:47.189 --> 00:00:50.749
for this session called Captchas
and Other Gotchas:

00:00:51.035 --> 00:00:53.172
Make Sure Your Secure Website
is Accessible

00:00:53.362 --> 00:00:54.462
with AmyJune Hineline.

00:00:55.482 --> 00:00:56.482
AmyJune

00:00:56.862 --> 00:01:01.019
is the Certified Community Architect
for the Linux Foundation.

00:01:01.666 --> 00:01:03.359
She is responsible for supporting

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.300
the certification team's efforts
in building and maintaining exams

00:01:09.329 --> 00:01:13.500
and related documentation
for exam products

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.699
in the Linux Foundation's
certification portfolio.

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:22.379
Her ongoing experience
as a hospice nurse keeps her in touch

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:24.750
with many end users' challenges.

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.349
In her continued efforts
to make a difference,

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:30.239
she helps organize

00:01:30.839 --> 00:01:33.119
the A11y Talks,

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.249
which is an online meetup

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.049
that advocates

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:43.530
all things accessibility,
one of the core components of building

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:44.890
an inclusive web.

00:01:45.779 --> 00:01:48.869
AmyJune also helps communities discover

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:55.170
how they can contribute and belong
in more ways than just code,

00:01:55.632 --> 00:01:56.969
hence, remarkably,

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.530
her ability to eat with her elbows
on the table has wowed the world.

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.799
Please feel free to add your questions
in the Zoom Q&amp;A section,

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:10.849
and we'll answer them
at the end of the presentation.

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:15.059
Also, use the chat to connect
with other attendees.

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.732
With that, I'd like to turn it
over to AmyJune.

00:02:19.109 --> 00:02:20.549
Thanks so much.
<v AmyJune Hineline> Thank you,

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:22.680
Simon. That's a really nice introduction.

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:26.789
I'm going to share my screen
because that's why everyone's here.

00:02:28.869 --> 00:02:30.773
Simon did a really good introduction.

00:02:30.779 --> 00:02:33.529
I barely have to say anything
my first couple of slides.

00:02:33.899 --> 00:02:37.122
I do want to do a couple
housekeeping things, though.

00:02:37.142 --> 00:02:39.784
I know that there's captions here,
but I'm going to show you a little trick

00:02:39.784 --> 00:02:40.784
with Google Slides.

00:02:40.984 --> 00:02:43.584
They're not the best thing
to work with in the world,

00:02:43.619 --> 00:02:46.620
but there's this really nifty thing
if captions aren't enabled if you're

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:47.920
at like a live conference.

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.770
If you see in the corner
of my screen, I'm hovering,

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.310
and I hover over these three dots.

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:55.619
I can enable captions here.

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:57.070
You have to be logged in,

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:01.050
but I do text size large
with the text position at the top,

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:04.799
and then I toggle them on,
and automatically there's captions

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:05.490
at the top.

00:03:05.491 --> 00:03:08.010
I'm going to turn them back off
because it'll interfere,

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.650
but I always like to share
that that is something that you can have

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:11.650
in Google Slides

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:15.810
for the bare necessity of captions.

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:21.371
Also, there's images in my slide deck,
and some of the images

00:03:21.421 --> 00:03:22.890
are for decoration,

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:25.828
but if they do add context
or they're kind of funny,

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:29.009
I will describe them for people
that visually can't see them.

00:03:30.689 --> 00:03:31.950
I think that's about it.

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:33.100
Then if you want,

00:03:33.619 --> 00:03:34.769
on the website,

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:39.237
and then here is a link to the slide deck
if you need to follow along.

00:03:39.267 --> 00:03:45.769
It's a bit.ly link wpa11y-2024.

00:03:45.898 --> 00:03:47.699
Simon did a great job introducing me.

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:49.658
My name is AmyJune, never Amy,

00:03:49.708 --> 00:03:52.870
never June,
always title camel case AmyJune.

00:03:53.131 --> 00:03:57.480
For those that can't see me visually,
I'm a White woman with dark blonde hair

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.298
wearing glasses
and a really cool mushroom shirt

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:02.219
that I got when I was 14 years old.

00:04:02.429 --> 00:04:05.260
It's one of the favorite shirts
I like to present in.

00:04:06.029 --> 00:04:09.239
This is a picture of Spotty McSpots A lot.

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:11.039
We call him Spot for short.

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:15.179
If there's any typos in the slide deck,
we can assume that he ran

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.149
across the keyboard and did
some designing for me,

00:04:18.179 --> 00:04:21.959
and he's
a really lovely white and gray tabby.

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:28.079
In this picture, he's smelling
a bouquet of pink and yellow flowers.

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:30.239
Today's agenda,

00:04:30.589 --> 00:04:33.839
I do admit it's going to be
a little bit redundant for some folks.

00:04:34.285 --> 00:04:36.649
Some of the basic
accessibility content

00:04:37.069 --> 00:04:39.269
I talk about at the beginning
of each section

00:04:39.739 --> 00:04:40.859
might have been presented

00:04:40.859 --> 00:04:43.710
in some of the some
of the other presentations today.

00:04:44.069 --> 00:04:46.569
Since this might be
one of the only talks you go to

00:04:46.609 --> 00:04:49.529
or maybe it's the first talk you went to,
and the fact that it will be

00:04:49.529 --> 00:04:53.820
a recording standing on its own,
I still feel the need to share the basics.

00:04:53.821 --> 00:04:55.949
I think that's super appropriate.

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:56.825
We're going to talk

00:04:56.845 --> 00:04:59.194
about some
of those accessibility guidelines.

00:04:59.255 --> 00:05:02.999
I'm going to sprinkle
in some WCAG guidelines

00:05:02.999 --> 00:05:05.149
around security throughout
the presentation.

00:05:05.399 --> 00:05:07.560
And then we'll also talk
about alternatives and how to make

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.120
our websites more accessible.

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:14.728
Before we get started today,
I know that this particular logo

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:17.460
comes from the Drupal community,
but this is just as important

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:18.810
in the WordPress community.

00:05:21.539 --> 00:05:24.092
In the light of a prominent
hosting platform

00:05:24.122 --> 00:05:27.000
in our communities
and their decision to host

00:05:29.149 --> 00:05:30.749
web presence of hate groups,

00:05:30.779 --> 00:05:32.909
I want to take a moment to remind folks

00:05:33.179 --> 00:05:37.408
to be sure that you're hosting
platform's accessible use policy prohibits

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:42.509
the platform from hosting organized
groups designated as hate groups

00:05:42.929 --> 00:05:47.280
when adequate evidence
has been provided of such a designation.

00:05:47.429 --> 00:05:48.429
That was a mouthful.

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:51.120
If you want to learn more about
why I included this slide,

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:57.149
you can go to nohostforhate.org
because hatred of any kind

00:05:57.449 --> 00:05:58.820
is so unacceptable.

00:05:59.876 --> 00:06:01.559
Into the presentation.

00:06:02.516 --> 00:06:08.189
First, we'll talk a little bit about WCAG,
the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines.

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:09.390
This is a goal.

00:06:09.391 --> 00:06:14.009
It shares a single standard
for web content accessibility

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:16.020
and our digital apps and things like that.

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:18.450
It's really made
for web content developers,

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:23.959
people who author our tools,
people that develop

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:26.809
our evaluation tools,
and really anyone

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:30.060
who needs a standard
for any sort of web accessibility.

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:34.439
I want to remind folks
that accessibility, inclusion,

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:38.369
and user experience
are very different things.

00:06:38.689 --> 00:06:41.189
They complement each other,
but they are different.

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:44.009
What makes content accessible?

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:48.178
There's four broad parameters
and we'll look at each of those today.

00:06:48.179 --> 00:06:53.160
That comes to how we get
into our website securely.

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:56.700
We want to make sure
that we accommodate visual needs,

00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:02.706
so we need to make sure
that our content is easy to "see".

00:07:03.479 --> 00:07:06.239
The CDC reports
that over 12 million people

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:09.328
in the United States alone live
with vision loss

00:07:09.329 --> 00:07:13.409
or some sort of vision disability
and one million are completely blind.

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:14.990
We also have to remember,

00:07:15.389 --> 00:07:19.769
I can see a little bit without my glasses,
but if I go outside and I'm waiting

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:23.609
for Bart and I have my cell phone out,
that glare keeps me from being able

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:28.016
to see or if my cell phone screen
is cracked.

00:07:28.309 --> 00:07:31.769
This is an image of a woman
with a rainbow going across her eye.

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:35.940
We want to make sure
that we accommodate motor needs,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.199
so we make sure that our assets
and products are easy to interact with.

00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:45.360
This is people who lives with a palsy
from Parkinson's or paraplegia from ALS

00:07:45.479 --> 00:07:46.479
or an accident.

00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:48.650
It could be someone like me,

00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:53.699
babysitting and holding a baby on a bus
and only having one arm to scroll.

00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:57.220
Here we have a woman in a striped shirt
writing in a notebook

00:07:57.270 --> 00:07:58.920
and she has a prosthetic arm.

00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:03.780
We want to make sure it's easy to hear,
so we accommodate auditory needs.

00:08:04.170 --> 00:08:06.930
This addresses people
who are in noisy environments

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:11.720
or quiet environments
and rely on captions for that audio

00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:14.881
but also helps our deaf
and hard-of-hearing friends as well.

00:08:15.149 --> 00:08:17.159
There's a picture of a sign right there.

00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:19.169
That last parameter

00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:24.682
is making sure
that we accommodate cognitive needs

00:08:24.882 --> 00:08:28.319
and that we make our websites
easy to understand.

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:32.849
This can be people who are distracted
or have a difficult time focusing.

00:08:33.659 --> 00:08:37.139
The images of a mother
and a young child who has Down syndrome

00:08:37.710 --> 00:08:39.539
looking at a recipe on a cell phone.

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:43.649
Those broad parameters actually have

00:08:44.969 --> 00:08:46.528
an acronym that go with them.

00:08:46.529 --> 00:08:50.038
It's POUR. It's perceivable,
operable, understandable,

00:08:50.039 --> 00:08:51.039
and robust.

00:08:51.419 --> 00:08:55.069
Perceivable means that you can use
your interface by means of your senses.

00:08:55.889 --> 00:09:00.839
Operable means that you can
and successfully use

00:09:02.789 --> 00:09:03.789
buttons,

00:09:04.229 --> 00:09:07.739
interactive elements,
controls, and navigation.

00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:09.238
Understandable.

00:09:09.239 --> 00:09:13.379
That means our users can understand
the content of our page and remember

00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:15.990
how to use the interface
from page to page.

00:09:16.199 --> 00:09:17.658
Remember how websites for a while

00:09:17.658 --> 00:09:20.160
had different type layouts
on every page?

00:09:20.369 --> 00:09:23.819
That makes it harder for people
to understand how to use your website.

00:09:23.969 --> 00:09:27.480
Then the last one is make sure
that you have a robust website.

00:09:27.809 --> 00:09:32.730
This refers to the fact that people access
our website and content in different means

00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:34.679
like assistive technology.

00:09:35.261 --> 00:09:39.419
This can be how they access
online documents like PDFs,

00:09:40.650 --> 00:09:43.380
our websites, our multimedia,
anything like that.

00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:47.969
Then there's four types of disabilities.

00:09:47.970 --> 00:09:49.079
There's probably more.

00:09:49.650 --> 00:09:51.500
Most people talk about three of them.

00:09:52.199 --> 00:09:56.280
Remember, as we get older,
we become more disabled with time.

00:09:56.790 --> 00:10:00.784
People do things
like their eyes deteriorate

00:10:00.834 --> 00:10:02.489
or their hearing goes down.

00:10:03.690 --> 00:10:07.879
There's temporary disabilities
like when we go to the dentist

00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:10.429
and we can't talk or we get

00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:12.469
ear surgery.

00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:16.908
There are situational disabilities
where they and the audience knows

00:10:16.909 --> 00:10:18.919
about the story in particular,

00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:23.299
not being able to find your mouse
or thinking that you didn't have a mouse

00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:25.989
for a long time or it was
out of batteries.

00:10:26.516 --> 00:10:28.129
Then we have permanent disabilities.

00:10:28.129 --> 00:10:30.710
These are disabilities that people
live with all of the time,

00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:32.450
all day long, all the hours.

00:10:32.869 --> 00:10:35.669
The new one that I came
across that I like to talk about,

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:39.770
I learned about it a couple of years ago,
was episodic disabilities.

00:10:40.099 --> 00:10:46.469
These are perhaps things
like cancer, HIV, diabetes.

00:10:46.679 --> 00:10:50.388
They're lifelong conditions
where some people have better days

00:10:50.510 --> 00:10:51.510
than others.

00:10:52.489 --> 00:10:56.290
It means we have periods
of fluctuating good health

00:10:56.621 --> 00:11:00.530
and ill health and our needs are
inconsistent.

00:11:01.099 --> 00:11:02.810
Depression can be episodic.

00:11:03.170 --> 00:11:05.658
Then, of course,
not every disability can be seen.

00:11:05.659 --> 00:11:09.259
We hear about invisible disabilities.

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:10.789
These can be headaches.

00:11:11.329 --> 00:11:14.690
Someone posted migraines, dizziness,
brain injuries,

00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:18.559
and hearing and vision loss
isn't always visible either.

00:11:18.919 --> 00:11:22.880
It's really about providing equal access
because it's a basic human right and not

00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:23.961
a special privileges.

00:11:24.076 --> 00:11:26.299
I don't want to hear
the word special needs anymore.

00:11:26.299 --> 00:11:27.949
I just want to hear human rights.

00:11:30.079 --> 00:11:34.039
I was called an edge case when I worked
at Red Hat because I asked for captions

00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:36.560
and then a screen
that actually provided space.

00:11:36.890 --> 00:11:41.209
That really upset me and I found
this quote from Eric Meyers that says

00:11:41.479 --> 00:11:45.768
when you call something an edge case,
you're really just defining

00:11:45.769 --> 00:11:48.140
the limits of what you care about.

00:11:51.130 --> 00:11:54.979
Every person is unique and has
basic human rights and inclusion

00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:55.980
is important.

00:11:56.450 --> 00:11:58.640
Now we're going to go
into stuff you might not know about,

00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:00.440
or might not have heard about today.

00:12:00.669 --> 00:12:01.819
User agents.

00:12:01.889 --> 00:12:04.732
We're talking about these particularly
because a lot of people

00:12:04.732 --> 00:12:05.983
can't access things

00:12:05.984 --> 00:12:08.508
with their user agents
when their website is locked down

00:12:08.508 --> 00:12:09.508
and secure.

00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:12.108
User agents are assistive technology.

00:12:12.109 --> 00:12:15.139
They're any device
or equipment that helps people

00:12:15.890 --> 00:12:18.260
get around some
of the challenges they have

00:12:18.289 --> 00:12:23.210
with learning or communicating
and really being able to function

00:12:23.269 --> 00:12:24.269
on the web.

00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:26.220
Screen readers.

00:12:26.659 --> 00:12:28.209
Most of us know what these are.

00:12:28.219 --> 00:12:30.710
It's used to listen
to the content of a webpage.

00:12:31.009 --> 00:12:33.199
They convert text to speech.

00:12:33.530 --> 00:12:36.709
We should keep in mind that screen readers
can be used along with visuals

00:12:36.709 --> 00:12:41.659
on the webpage for folks
with cognitive challenges as well.

00:12:41.780 --> 00:12:46.339
Here we have a picture of a man wearing
glasses and he you can see his cane

00:12:46.340 --> 00:12:48.500
next to him and he's using a computer.

00:12:50.712 --> 00:12:57.859
Screen magnification devices,
this is really close to its name.

00:12:58.100 --> 00:13:01.600
You hit command plus plus on a Mac
and it magnifies the screen for you.

00:13:01.748 --> 00:13:05.568
One of those rules is on a website,
you should be able to magnify to 200%

00:13:05.569 --> 00:13:08.060
and not lose any
of the content of the screen.

00:13:08.589 --> 00:13:11.239
You should still be able
to interact with the element.

00:13:12.379 --> 00:13:14.899
It's for people who have
partial sight impairment.

00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:18.080
Like I said, it's basically

00:13:19.490 --> 00:13:20.719
to enlarge the content.

00:13:21.079 --> 00:13:26.090
Screen magnifiers sometimes also have
text-to-speech functionality as well.

00:13:27.310 --> 00:13:28.120
There's a few more.

00:13:28.170 --> 00:13:30.949
There's eye tracking
that monitors your eye movements

00:13:31.490 --> 00:13:33.618
and blinking to initiate mouse clicks.

00:13:33.619 --> 00:13:38.570
There's accelerators that helps reduce
the need to type or click.

00:13:39.081 --> 00:13:40.309
Keyboard customization.

00:13:40.310 --> 00:13:41.929
Sometimes these are called sticky keys.

00:13:41.929 --> 00:13:44.479
Sometimes they're called shortcut keys.

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:46.789
They enable one-hand typing.

00:13:47.372 --> 00:13:50.422
Maybe you have a broken collarbone
and can only have one hand.

00:13:50.716 --> 00:13:52.729
Pop-up and animation blockers.

00:13:52.729 --> 00:13:54.901
All of us love these
because those are annoying.

00:13:54.901 --> 00:13:59.305
There are browser plug-ins that stop
the automatic pop-ups

00:13:59.485 --> 00:14:01.605
and that redirection that happens.

00:14:01.655 --> 00:14:04.374
Imagine being a screen reader
and reading the content

00:14:04.375 --> 00:14:07.272
of the page and all of a sudden
being popped into a pop-up

00:14:07.322 --> 00:14:10.222
about an ad you don't care about
not being able to get out.

00:14:10.699 --> 00:14:13.550
We have these animation blockers
that allow

00:14:15.380 --> 00:14:19.248
the stopping of the redirection
or having the ability to stop,

00:14:19.249 --> 00:14:20.839
pause, and hide animations.

00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:23.089
We have refreshable Braille displays.

00:14:23.089 --> 00:14:25.459
There's an image of that on the slide.

00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:31.548
These are mechanical terminals
that display a line of Braille characters

00:14:31.549 --> 00:14:33.770
dynamically by raising and lowering dots.

00:14:34.810 --> 00:14:36.470
Then there's all kinds
of reading assistance

00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:40.248
that can customize font size,
that can scan text for words,

00:14:40.249 --> 00:14:41.509
use dictionary clues,

00:14:42.889 --> 00:14:45.049
hide less relevant parts of the thing.

00:14:45.055 --> 00:14:48.440
Like if there's a mega menu
or sticky menu that keeps coming down

00:14:48.979 --> 00:14:50.718
and then there's page maps.

00:14:50.719 --> 00:14:53.899
Those are neat for people
who have a hard time focusing.

00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:56.149
It's a little square
on the side of the screen

00:14:56.149 --> 00:14:57.149
with an indicator

00:14:57.950 --> 00:15:01.160
highlighting the portion of the webpage
that's being viewed.

00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:05.150
When it comes to secure websites

00:15:05.689 --> 00:15:07.369
and I have a really hard time
with this word,

00:15:07.369 --> 00:15:08.619
so I have to say it slow.

00:15:09.019 --> 00:15:13.998
Authentication is really
our first line when it comes

00:15:13.999 --> 00:15:16.549
to the security of our assets.

00:15:16.850 --> 00:15:21.529
When authentication requires
our users to input things,

00:15:21.739 --> 00:15:24.378
the best practices
should always include giving

00:15:24.379 --> 00:15:26.209
your users options and choices.

00:15:26.690 --> 00:15:29.570
You're going to hear
that a lot while I'm talking today

00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:34.789
about giving your users options
and choices because not all of us access

00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:35.990
the web in the same way.

00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:40.969
Here's one of those sprinklings
of WCAG I was talking about.

00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:45.469
These are real concerns.

00:15:45.499 --> 00:15:48.708
They're so concerning to some folks
that they have guidelines.

00:15:48.709 --> 00:15:51.499
I think all accessibility stuff
is concerning,

00:15:51.679 --> 00:15:54.860
but there's a group of people that found
the most concerning things and made

00:15:54.860 --> 00:15:55.860
a set of guidelines.

00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:59.780
There's a guideline specifically
on accessible authentication.

00:16:00.290 --> 00:16:01.370
You want to ensure

00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:07.520
that there is an accessible,
easy-to-use, and secure method

00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:14.720
to access content
and undertake tasks.

00:16:15.039 --> 00:16:16.219
Who does this benefit?

00:16:16.730 --> 00:16:20.449
It benefits people who have
cognitive things going

00:16:20.450 --> 00:16:22.520
on related to memory.

00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:23.840
This can be dementia.

00:16:24.050 --> 00:16:25.119
This can be ADHD.

00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:31.008
It could be those disassociative amnesia,
it could be a headache

00:16:31.009 --> 00:16:33.528
that's so bad you can't remember
what just happened.

00:16:33.528 --> 00:16:35.930
It also helps our dyslexic folks

00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:40.478
who get some of the words
and letters turned around.

00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:42.859
Dyscalculia, where we get our numbers

00:16:43.639 --> 00:16:45.319
backwards and mixed up.

00:16:45.770 --> 00:16:49.430
Then people with perception
processing limitations

00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:55.250
should also be able to use your website
and authenticate and prove who they are,

00:16:55.399 --> 00:16:58.460
regardless of their level
of cognitive abilities.

00:16:58.759 --> 00:17:00.230
Again, it's about inclusion.

00:17:01.810 --> 00:17:05.295
A lot of the things about security
come around are gated content.

00:17:06.109 --> 00:17:11.359
Gated content requires
a user to complete a form,

00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:14.839
do some sort of task,
purchase a subscription.

00:17:14.959 --> 00:17:17.544
I almost said prescription
because I'm a nurse,

00:17:17.650 --> 00:17:18.740
Subscription.

00:17:19.310 --> 00:17:20.390
What's gated content?

00:17:20.690 --> 00:17:24.050
It's online materials
like white papers, articles,

00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:29.239
videos that require our content consumers
to fill out a form

00:17:29.329 --> 00:17:30.830
before they can access them.

00:17:31.630 --> 00:17:32.630
White papers

00:17:34.279 --> 00:17:35.690
can be from the medical field.

00:17:35.690 --> 00:17:40.339
They can be marketers that create
white papers to educate their audience

00:17:40.340 --> 00:17:47.180
about a particular issue or explain
and promote a particular methodology.

00:17:47.809 --> 00:17:48.950
We have e-books.

00:17:49.490 --> 00:17:52.340
Not everyone gives
their electronic books out for free.

00:17:52.819 --> 00:17:56.720
Webinars and learning courses
usually come behind a paywall.

00:17:57.080 --> 00:18:01.370
Product demos will ask for an email
so they can track and sell you products.

00:18:02.748 --> 00:18:05.240
Signing up for curated emails.

00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:10.028
Subscriptions, [laughs]

00:18:10.399 --> 00:18:11.540
RSS feeds.

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:15.824
They also could include forums
to exclusive communities

00:18:15.825 --> 00:18:19.760
like in Discourse or Discord,
contest entry forms.

00:18:20.179 --> 00:18:24.558
Along with access to surveys and forms
that can be gated to be logged in to win

00:18:24.559 --> 00:18:26.270
a promotion or a prize.

00:18:28.515 --> 00:18:31.370
I want to talk about some
of the most common security measures

00:18:31.370 --> 00:18:33.500
that we use on our digital assets.

00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:36.468
The first one being CAPTCHAs.

00:18:37.459 --> 00:18:38.719
What is a CAPTCHA?

00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:39.919
It's an acronym

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:45.192
and it means Completely
Automated Public Turing test

00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:47.989
to tell Computers and Humans Apart.

00:18:48.619 --> 00:18:49.619
Are you a bot?

00:18:50.150 --> 00:18:53.929
We've seen them as simple
as in this image.

00:18:54.009 --> 00:18:55.192
This isn't really that simple.

00:18:55.192 --> 00:18:57.385
That's a bad word to say.

00:18:57.416 --> 00:18:59.097
Straightforward.

00:18:59.136 --> 00:19:03.259
We've had to listen for letters,
maybe do a math puzzle.

00:19:03.650 --> 00:19:04.850
Often lately,

00:19:04.879 --> 00:19:07.632
and this is the best thing
that you can do is we'll see

00:19:07.652 --> 00:19:10.279
a checkbox asking for a human or a bot.

00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:14.209
I want to talk a little bit
about the image up here.

00:19:14.209 --> 00:19:14.871
It's CAPTCHA.

00:19:14.969 --> 00:19:17.149
We see a lot of these CAPTCHA
where you have

00:19:17.150 --> 00:19:21.468
to pick all of the bridges
or all of the all of the boats,

00:19:21.469 --> 00:19:22.700
all of the stoplights.

00:19:22.729 --> 00:19:25.429
One, if you don't have
visual access to the image,

00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:26.430
you can't do that.

00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:29.040
I'll talk about that more.

00:19:29.119 --> 00:19:30.119
Why?

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:33.400
What you should do about it,

00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:35.359
why these CAPTCHAs exist.

00:19:36.159 --> 00:19:41.169
This one specifically is
a culturally specific CAPTCHA.

00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:46.849
If possible, we want to avoid users
identifying objects that are specific

00:19:46.850 --> 00:19:51.050
to one culture or context or have
regional differences in appearance.

00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:52.939
British users

00:19:54.620 --> 00:19:56.510
won't identify crosswalks

00:19:57.109 --> 00:19:59.450
because crosswalk is an American term.

00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:00.830
In this CAPTCHA.

00:20:00.843 --> 00:20:04.670
It's a bunch of puzzle devices
and ask users to find a yoko,

00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:07.639
which I had no idea what it was,
so I wouldn't be able to be able

00:20:07.639 --> 00:20:08.639
to finish

00:20:09.530 --> 00:20:10.669
this puzzle.

00:20:11.769 --> 00:20:13.456
Here's another CAPTCHA.

00:20:13.929 --> 00:20:17.359
It's asking the person who sees this.

00:20:17.599 --> 00:20:21.680
It's a site one, and it also introduces

00:20:22.310 --> 00:20:23.310
mobility.

00:20:24.019 --> 00:20:25.019
It says

00:20:26.450 --> 00:20:28.910
when you see exactly
two arrows pointing up,

00:20:29.329 --> 00:20:30.329
touch done.

00:20:31.129 --> 00:20:35.210
One, you have to be able to see
which arrows are pointing up.

00:20:35.780 --> 00:20:39.440
Two, you have to be able
to press that button in time.

00:20:42.769 --> 00:20:45.859
Not everyone can see
the screen and identify images.

00:20:45.979 --> 00:20:48.859
We talk about standard image accessibility
because that's

00:20:48.860 --> 00:20:55.219
one of the tenets of an accessible web
is text alternatives to images.

00:20:57.530 --> 00:20:59.989
When we provide
alternative text, it defeats

00:20:59.990 --> 00:21:04.068
the purpose of weeding out the machines
because now they're able to parse it.

00:21:04.069 --> 00:21:05.840
They're able to read the alt text.

00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:10.309
Sometimes we see simple questions
like four plus two.

00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:16.010
Again, this can be challenging for folks
with cognitive processing issues.

00:21:16.609 --> 00:21:18.799
This CAPTCHA is algebra.

00:21:19.429 --> 00:21:21.980
I might know what this is
because I'm a math major,

00:21:22.189 --> 00:21:26.450
but who really uses this
kind of stuff in day-to-day life?

00:21:26.689 --> 00:21:28.749
Who knows what a sign is anymore?

00:21:29.390 --> 00:21:33.889
These complicated captions
don't allow everyone free access.

00:21:34.369 --> 00:21:37.639
We want to make sure we provide
alternatives to the CAPTCHA

00:21:38.029 --> 00:21:41.028
that are accessible
for your entire audience,

00:21:41.029 --> 00:21:46.069
including people with vision, hearing,
and neurocognitive disabilities.

00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:48.740
We'll talk about alternatives
in a little bit.

00:21:49.999 --> 00:21:50.999
Timers.

00:21:51.349 --> 00:21:53.060
Timers and time-based

00:21:54.140 --> 00:21:56.689
passwords
are really common security measures,

00:21:57.620 --> 00:22:02.449
but people with disabilities
may require more time to complete

00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:06.890
some of these activities
and time sessions can pose problems.

00:22:07.700 --> 00:22:12.349
Someone who has a reading disability
like dyslexia will likely take longer

00:22:12.350 --> 00:22:16.519
to read the instructions and understand
what's going on in a form.

00:22:17.269 --> 00:22:21.049
Someone who is deaf
may be more comfortable with sign language

00:22:21.050 --> 00:22:23.900
than they are with written words,
so it might take them longer

00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:25.669
to parse the information too.

00:22:29.099 --> 00:22:31.580
This also holds true for people whose

00:22:31.990 --> 00:22:35.063
your set language on your page,
they aren't native speakers.

00:22:35.064 --> 00:22:40.668
If this is an English presentation someone
who who is English as a second language

00:22:40.669 --> 00:22:43.190
might take longer to parse
the information as well.

00:22:43.969 --> 00:22:46.759
Someone who relies on some
of that assistive technology.

00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:49.279
We talked about screen readers
because they're blind or have

00:22:49.279 --> 00:22:50.279
a vision impairment

00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:52.819
or maybe they have a learning disability.

00:22:52.819 --> 00:22:57.710
It could take them more time to locate
all of the elements on the screen

00:22:58.460 --> 00:23:02.119
because they might have to flip
through a rotor or something or understand

00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:03.120
the page layout.

00:23:03.259 --> 00:23:06.259
There's a loose guideline,

00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:09.230
unless the time limit
is longer than 20 hours,

00:23:09.289 --> 00:23:13.129
all timed sessions
should be able to be turned off,

00:23:13.399 --> 00:23:14.399
adjusted,

00:23:14.450 --> 00:23:18.200
or extended unless it's essential
for the activity.

00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:19.500
Now,

00:23:20.539 --> 00:23:22.160
I use these examples loosely.

00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:27.469
It's like an auction or paying
bills online or concert tickets.

00:23:27.859 --> 00:23:31.209
Let me tell you about concert tickets
because I love to go to shows.

00:23:31.370 --> 00:23:33.819
I'll be upstairs and I'll be dialing in

00:23:33.820 --> 00:23:35.490
and getting in line and getting
in the queue

00:23:35.490 --> 00:23:37.840
and I finally am able to buy
my concert ticket

00:23:38.130 --> 00:23:39.800
and I have to put
in my credit card number,

00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:42.439
and what do you know,
my credit card is downstairs.

00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:44.720
I got to run downstairs,
trip over the cat,

00:23:46.159 --> 00:23:48.709
yell at my kids at something,
find my purse,

00:23:48.799 --> 00:23:49.909
get out my wallet.

00:23:49.999 --> 00:23:52.413
My credit card is not in there
because I got gas yesterday,

00:23:52.413 --> 00:23:54.844
so I have to find my skirt
where my credit card is.

00:23:54.844 --> 00:23:57.484
By the time I go upstairs,
the timer has run out

00:23:57.514 --> 00:24:00.979
and I have to go through that whole line
in the concert queue again.

00:24:01.609 --> 00:24:05.600
Again I know that this is
a very individual problem just to me,

00:24:05.870 --> 00:24:10.099
but allow the ability
for the timer to be turned off,

00:24:10.279 --> 00:24:12.019
adjusted, or extended.

00:24:14.090 --> 00:24:18.110
We have time-based one-time passwords.

00:24:18.380 --> 00:24:21.329
We sometimes see them abbreviated
as TOTPs.

00:24:26.540 --> 00:24:30.709
This might be problematic
for folks with sight

00:24:31.429 --> 00:24:33.920
or cognitive or motor skill disabilities.

00:24:34.429 --> 00:24:35.629
It might be hard

00:24:36.349 --> 00:24:41.658
or maybe even extremely difficult for some
with cognitive processing issues to take

00:24:41.659 --> 00:24:47.539
a code from one screen
and then move it to another screen

00:24:47.570 --> 00:24:50.420
in the designated allotment of time.

00:24:50.989 --> 00:24:57.018
Sometimes the authenticator applications
and messaging apps aren't compatible

00:24:57.019 --> 00:24:58.160
with screen readers.

00:24:58.659 --> 00:24:59.659
Again,

00:25:00.589 --> 00:25:04.279
you should be able to turn off the timing,
adjust the timing,

00:25:04.310 --> 00:25:05.310
extend the timing.

00:25:05.870 --> 00:25:09.260
Here's a picture of an authenticating app
with the numbers and you see

00:25:09.260 --> 00:25:10.260
the timer--

00:25:11.491 --> 00:25:16.580
you can't see it moving,
but it's shrinking down.

00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:18.259
That creates a lot of anxiety, too,

00:25:18.259 --> 00:25:21.738
with some folks. Just having
a timer presence can make it harder

00:25:21.739 --> 00:25:25.458
to remember or to be able to navigate
the experience from moving

00:25:25.459 --> 00:25:27.109
one screen to another.

00:25:28.699 --> 00:25:32.059
There's a guideline
in WCAG around enough time.

00:25:32.629 --> 00:25:36.649
We want to provide our users
with enough time to finish their tasks.

00:25:37.009 --> 00:25:38.009
Bravo.

00:25:38.299 --> 00:25:41.659
Not everyone can zip through a form
or enter their credit card

00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:43.789
at top speed or find it.

00:25:45.769 --> 00:25:47.570
Again, the timing

00:25:48.837 --> 00:25:51.559
needs to be adjustable,
or that there's no timing.

00:25:51.950 --> 00:25:55.699
Be sure that interruptions
can be postponed or suppressed

00:25:55.700 --> 00:25:56.700
by the user.

00:25:56.839 --> 00:25:59.139
This could be harder
with assistive technology.

00:26:00.020 --> 00:26:03.470
When an authenticated session expires,

00:26:04.069 --> 00:26:07.159
allow the user to continue
what they're doing

00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:09.350
without the loss of data.

00:26:09.590 --> 00:26:10.819
Oh, isn't it the worst,

00:26:10.820 --> 00:26:14.659
you run out of time, you refresh the page,
and that whole form you filled out

00:26:14.660 --> 00:26:15.830
is empty again?

00:26:17.727 --> 00:26:22.130
Make sure that users are warned
that the duration of their activity,

00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:23.900
that there could be data loss.

00:26:23.990 --> 00:26:27.469
Again, that adjust, extend,
and stop and pause.

00:26:27.769 --> 00:26:29.720
Allow your users those choices.

00:26:31.249 --> 00:26:35.179
What are some other verification methods
for making sure we say who we are?

00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:37.459
Identity verification.

00:26:38.929 --> 00:26:39.949
Biometrics.

00:26:40.039 --> 00:26:46.969
This is a technical term that refers
to a human's or a being's physical

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:48.259
or behavioral traits.

00:26:48.889 --> 00:26:50.510
We have voice recognition.

00:26:52.174 --> 00:26:56.449
All of these things have some problems
that come along with using them

00:26:56.450 --> 00:26:57.620
as security measures.

00:26:58.029 --> 00:26:59.090
Voice recognition.

00:26:59.299 --> 00:27:00.949
Someone might have a sore throat.

00:27:01.249 --> 00:27:04.199
Maybe you were at a concert last night
and sang really loud.

00:27:05.140 --> 00:27:08.060
Perhaps you're at a conference
and there's noise in the background

00:27:08.060 --> 00:27:09.140
or you're on a train.

00:27:10.129 --> 00:27:11.360
Facial recognition.

00:27:12.139 --> 00:27:15.920
It does not require sight, hearing,
or significant motor skills.

00:27:16.219 --> 00:27:20.719
It makes it ideal for many users,
but there's quite a few situations

00:27:20.989 --> 00:27:24.500
that affect that biometric
of facial recognition.

00:27:25.910 --> 00:27:31.608
When we were wearing masks during COVID,
it affected me when I was in customs

00:27:31.609 --> 00:27:33.059
coming through having a mask.

00:27:33.820 --> 00:27:36.590
There's hijabs,
there's burqas and other face coverings,

00:27:36.860 --> 00:27:38.119
beards that people

00:27:38.649 --> 00:27:40.415
grew during COVID.

00:27:41.659 --> 00:27:45.830
Weight fluctuations can also affect
facial features as well.

00:27:46.443 --> 00:27:47.959
There's fingerprint scanning.

00:27:48.709 --> 00:27:52.339
Perhaps you've been shoveling snow,
which I hope no one has to do,

00:27:52.340 --> 00:27:56.810
but some people live in those places,
and your hands are chapped or blistered.

00:27:57.049 --> 00:28:01.518
Or maybe you've been working in the garden
and your fingerprints are filled in

00:28:01.519 --> 00:28:02.519
with dirt.

00:28:02.840 --> 00:28:04.190
It fills in those crevices.

00:28:05.089 --> 00:28:08.810
There's always the possibility
that someone doesn't have any hands,

00:28:09.019 --> 00:28:10.910
or they did and now they don't.

00:28:11.180 --> 00:28:14.118
Or maybe they don't have
use of one of them temporarily

00:28:14.119 --> 00:28:17.300
because they're holding something
or have a broken collarbone.

00:28:19.279 --> 00:28:22.490
The last biometric I'm going
to talk about is eye recognition.

00:28:22.939 --> 00:28:24.320
Eye recognition is great.

00:28:24.559 --> 00:28:26.060
It can tell twins apart

00:28:26.869 --> 00:28:31.369
because it uses the irises for matching,
but what if we logged

00:28:31.370 --> 00:28:37.610
in the first time one way,
we don't log in for years.

00:28:38.029 --> 00:28:41.540
We have cataracts
or maybe we have the loss of an eye.

00:28:42.260 --> 00:28:45.060
In this image, there's a woman
wearing a facial covering.

00:28:46.869 --> 00:28:50.867
We have multi-factor authentication, MFAs.

00:28:51.529 --> 00:28:53.809
Lots of times I opt,

00:28:53.810 --> 00:28:57.440
I'm not sure what everyone else does,
but I opt to get SMS,

00:28:57.499 --> 00:28:58.609
phone text messages.

00:28:58.969 --> 00:29:00.949
These are texted codes.

00:29:01.490 --> 00:29:04.819
They may be a bit less secure
than authenticator apps,

00:29:05.150 --> 00:29:09.109
but they're also common for solution
because of their ease of use

00:29:09.710 --> 00:29:10.969
and wide availability.

00:29:10.970 --> 00:29:13.468
Most people have text
messaging these days.

00:29:13.668 --> 00:29:17.389
A tradeoff may be worth it
for people who have difficulties

00:29:17.390 --> 00:29:18.709
typing codes quickly.

00:29:19.879 --> 00:29:22.249
Screen readers
and text-to-speech functions

00:29:22.250 --> 00:29:25.970
are more likely to work seamlessly
with a native app like texting as well.

00:29:27.679 --> 00:29:30.709
I don't have anything really prepared
to talk about what I read

00:29:30.709 --> 00:29:33.469
about with Apple's newest
security release,

00:29:33.529 --> 00:29:35.151
but there's some kind of security

00:29:35.151 --> 00:29:38.990
that they fixed because screen readers
were reading passwords out loud.

00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:40.930
That's something to think about, too,

00:29:41.510 --> 00:29:44.900
when you're using
these authentication methods.

00:29:46.462 --> 00:29:47.989
Like I said, I don't have
anything prepared for that.

00:29:47.989 --> 00:29:50.060
I was just reading the release notes.

00:29:51.199 --> 00:29:52.548
We have email-based.

00:29:52.549 --> 00:29:55.758
These are your security code
is sent through email.

00:29:55.759 --> 00:29:58.190
Sometimes that's really convenient
because your email is right

00:29:58.190 --> 00:29:58.842
on your computer.

00:29:58.910 --> 00:30:03.470
You can copy and paste
from your email into the website.

00:30:03.860 --> 00:30:06.301
Sometimes you have
text messaging app on your phone,

00:30:06.301 --> 00:30:09.251
and you can do the same thing,
allowing that copy and paste.

00:30:12.249 --> 00:30:13.539
Connected tokens,

00:30:13.704 --> 00:30:18.456
these require a plug or a dongle
that you insert into your device.

00:30:18.894 --> 00:30:22.810
It may require a second step,
like pressing a button or using

00:30:22.810 --> 00:30:26.348
a biometric challenge,
but they do not require

00:30:26.349 --> 00:30:28.210
users to input a code,

00:30:28.510 --> 00:30:32.559
making that multi-factor
authentication process

00:30:32.799 --> 00:30:37.900
a little bit more accessible
for users who live with motor,

00:30:38.529 --> 00:30:40.900
visual, and cognitive disabilities.

00:30:41.879 --> 00:30:44.259
Oh, and there's single sign-on.

00:30:44.260 --> 00:30:46.819
A lot of places are switching to this.

00:30:46.820 --> 00:30:50.949
You'll see enter your Google,

00:30:51.580 --> 00:30:52.580
your Gmail.

00:30:52.737 --> 00:30:59.618
SSO, it significantly reduces the friction
by only requiring one login per session,

00:30:59.808 --> 00:31:03.355
but still has some of those issues
with that first sign-in

00:31:03.386 --> 00:31:05.949
that most MFAs have.

00:31:07.689 --> 00:31:11.079
Let's talk about scanning
IDs and certificates.

00:31:11.679 --> 00:31:17.260
This can be bank apps when
depositing checks through your phone.

00:31:17.710 --> 00:31:19.839
This can be vaccination records.

00:31:20.289 --> 00:31:25.360
This could be certificate-based
signatures,

00:31:25.569 --> 00:31:29.140
PDFs sometimes require a valid ID.

00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:33.400
It could be for I-9 employment
eligibility verification.

00:31:33.610 --> 00:31:38.049
Sometimes it requires several forms of ID
to be submitted to prove your identity.

00:31:39.100 --> 00:31:43.210
Sometimes folks
who live with a palsy a shake,

00:31:43.899 --> 00:31:48.399
are unable to hold the document
or the user agent still enough

00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:51.340
for the computer or app to scan.

00:31:51.790 --> 00:31:54.339
Have you ever been there
where you've put your check,

00:31:54.339 --> 00:31:57.010
you're trying to deposit a check,
and it's on the dark surface,

00:31:57.010 --> 00:31:59.050
and it says, "Keep moving closer,"
but you're shaking,

00:31:59.050 --> 00:32:02.150
and you can't get it quite right,
and you can't get it to scan.

00:32:03.519 --> 00:32:07.458
A person with low vision may not be able
to line up the scanner

00:32:07.648 --> 00:32:10.870
and put the documents into focus.

00:32:11.199 --> 00:32:14.170
There's a picture of a passport there.

00:32:22.180 --> 00:32:24.490
What can we do about hidden passwords?

00:32:26.709 --> 00:32:28.719
We can have label form controls.

00:32:29.170 --> 00:32:33.280
We can allow copy-and-paste functionality
to work in these tools as well.

00:32:34.269 --> 00:32:37.329
We can allow tools to fill in credentials.

00:32:37.779 --> 00:32:40.030
I'm going to describe this image
because I really think this is

00:32:40.030 --> 00:32:45.849
the best way that you can help your users
with these hidden passwords is this is

00:32:45.850 --> 00:32:49.310
an image of someone trying to log
into a Gmail account

00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:51.691
and it's enter your password,

00:32:51.741 --> 00:32:55.000
and there's a checkbox that allows you
to show the password

00:32:55.001 --> 00:32:57.651
so you can see if you entered
your password correctly.

00:32:57.789 --> 00:33:00.950
This really affects you
when you've entered your password

00:33:00.951 --> 00:33:02.058
two or three times,

00:33:02.059 --> 00:33:03.939
and they say you only have
one attempt left,

00:33:03.939 --> 00:33:05.689
and then you're logged out forever.

00:33:05.950 --> 00:33:09.728
Having that ability to show
the password helps people identify

00:33:09.729 --> 00:33:11.079
what mistakes they've made.

00:33:11.230 --> 00:33:13.900
I know that I type faster
with one hand than the other,

00:33:13.900 --> 00:33:17.588
so sometimes I get a capital letter
when it shouldn't be,

00:33:17.589 --> 00:33:21.249
or my A and my M
are backwards with my name.

00:33:23.799 --> 00:33:24.799
Proctoring.

00:33:25.029 --> 00:33:27.939
I work at the Linux Foundation
helping build exams,

00:33:27.940 --> 00:33:30.510
and so proctoring is something
I never really thought about before

00:33:30.510 --> 00:33:32.661
but have been thinking
about a lot recently.

00:33:33.669 --> 00:33:35.163
Proctoring can be for tests,

00:33:35.169 --> 00:33:40.450
it can be for making sure that people
are doing a task that is specified.

00:33:40.810 --> 00:33:42.460
It involves monitoring

00:33:44.500 --> 00:33:45.500
attendees,

00:33:45.549 --> 00:33:49.420
task takers, so they can complete
their task and be watched.

00:33:49.809 --> 00:33:50.809
Ideally,

00:33:50.889 --> 00:33:57.100
this is a process overseen
by a third party that's neutral.

00:33:57.849 --> 00:34:00.280
Sometimes it's conducted through a webcam

00:34:01.089 --> 00:34:03.279
in most online proctoring situations.

00:34:04.539 --> 00:34:09.488
Authentication failures can happen,
and privacy concerns are introduced

00:34:09.489 --> 00:34:10.959
when verifying examinees.

00:34:11.050 --> 00:34:13.659
Have you ever tried to take an exam,
and you're trying to hold up the ID,

00:34:13.659 --> 00:34:16.569
and the voice comes
on that says they can't do that,

00:34:16.570 --> 00:34:18.570
or there's something in your background?

00:34:18.940 --> 00:34:23.409
Does your proctoring solution support
and integrate with assistive technology?

00:34:25.330 --> 00:34:29.289
Can you be observed and use
your screen readers,

00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:32.650
your alternative keyboards,
or your graphic organizers?

00:34:34.542 --> 00:34:38.650
Students should be able to maintain
a certain level of navigation control,

00:34:38.679 --> 00:34:41.618
including being able to select
things without a mouse.

00:34:41.619 --> 00:34:42.909
Not everyone uses a mouse.

00:34:42.909 --> 00:34:49.630
You should be able to use
shortcut keys or tab navigation.

00:34:50.469 --> 00:34:53.229
We should be able to use
speech-to-text software.

00:34:53.230 --> 00:34:55.719
Sometimes they don't want
that because they're afraid people

00:34:55.719 --> 00:34:57.309
are going to hear,
or people are going to cheat

00:34:57.309 --> 00:35:01.958
and write the exam questions down,
but proctors can ensure the software

00:35:01.959 --> 00:35:04.780
is used appropriately
by monitoring the exam environment.

00:35:05.130 --> 00:35:06.130
Hearing aids,

00:35:06.777 --> 00:35:08.647
you're not supposed
to wear things in your ears

00:35:08.647 --> 00:35:10.367
so some people have to go like this,

00:35:10.367 --> 00:35:12.667
and they have to prove
that it's a hearing aid.

00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:17.740
Proctors can verify hearing aids
as genuine accommodation tools

00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:20.500
and not for accessing

00:35:21.149 --> 00:35:24.099
unauthorized information,
either coming out or going in.

00:35:25.169 --> 00:35:26.799
Assistive keyboards and mice,

00:35:27.010 --> 00:35:33.639
proctors should be able to know
that these devices are solely

00:35:33.640 --> 00:35:35.919
for accessibility purposes
and not for cheating,

00:35:35.919 --> 00:35:39.309
and the same thing with text magnifiers.

00:35:39.549 --> 00:35:42.819
Here is an image of someone
with long hair.

00:35:42.820 --> 00:35:46.509
You can see a cochlear ear device,
and they're reading their phone.

00:35:50.709 --> 00:35:54.880
Some random operability with CAG here.

00:35:55.120 --> 00:35:57.759
We want to make sure
that our user interface components

00:35:57.759 --> 00:36:00.310
and navigation must be operable.

00:36:00.359 --> 00:36:02.169
That means you'll be able to use them.

00:36:02.169 --> 00:36:03.769
We're talking about target size.

00:36:03.810 --> 00:36:09.142
Can someone on a mobile phone who has
large fingers close the window

00:36:09.143 --> 00:36:13.180
or someone who has palsy
get that target with their mouse?

00:36:13.749 --> 00:36:14.749
Focus order,

00:36:14.950 --> 00:36:19.209
we want to know that the user has
enough time to tab through the whole page

00:36:19.240 --> 00:36:20.410
to get to the close button.

00:36:20.410 --> 00:36:22.860
This has to do
with the next section I talk about.

00:36:23.530 --> 00:36:24.639
Visible focus,

00:36:25.809 --> 00:36:30.098
can our users use assistive devices
and know where they are

00:36:30.099 --> 00:36:31.959
with a visual marker on a screen?

00:36:32.369 --> 00:36:36.919
Can a keyboard user access
a dialogue or pop-up?

00:36:37.229 --> 00:36:38.979
Then is there a keyboard trap?

00:36:38.980 --> 00:36:43.569
If people get into an element
with their keyboard,

00:36:43.599 --> 00:36:44.409
can they get out?

00:36:44.410 --> 00:36:46.210
If not, it's called a keyboard trap.

00:36:47.679 --> 00:36:49.694
I think this slide may
be a little bit out of order

00:36:49.694 --> 00:36:51.784
because my next section
is about pop-ups,

00:36:52.044 --> 00:36:53.469
so I have a little description

00:36:53.469 --> 00:36:56.320
about what an accessible module dialogue
is.

00:36:56.590 --> 00:36:57.590
It's one

00:36:57.820 --> 00:37:01.299
where it's managed properly
and the correct information is exposed

00:37:01.300 --> 00:37:02.350
to the screen reader.

00:37:02.470 --> 00:37:03.550
We can do this.

00:37:03.730 --> 00:37:05.199
It's pretty straightforward.

00:37:05.320 --> 00:37:08.500
We use native HTML5,
and then we use ARIA

00:37:08.550 --> 00:37:11.110
to provide the necessary
semantic information.

00:37:11.410 --> 00:37:12.579
You can use the CSS

00:37:13.090 --> 00:37:19.028
to theme the appearance,
and you can use JavaScript to manufacture

00:37:19.029 --> 00:37:20.500
the behavior.

00:37:22.239 --> 00:37:24.489
Leads into alerts,

00:37:24.549 --> 00:37:28.090
modals, and other pop-upy type
annoying things.

00:37:29.935 --> 00:37:32.819
JavaScript pop-up windows
should only be used

00:37:32.979 --> 00:37:37.210
if it adds significant advantage
in the functionality.

00:37:38.260 --> 00:37:41.410
Because think about it,
what if someone has JavaScript disabled?

00:37:41.949 --> 00:37:43.059
A lot of people do.

00:37:45.490 --> 00:37:50.229
If you do have a pop-up that opens
a new window or a new tab either

00:37:50.230 --> 00:37:52.840
with that target attribute
or with a script,

00:37:53.260 --> 00:37:58.389
then add a label that the link
is opening it up in a new window or tab.

00:37:59.230 --> 00:38:02.259
Think about people
who are using screen readers

00:38:03.129 --> 00:38:05.258
or even on visual browsers.

00:38:05.259 --> 00:38:08.229
They're confused when they realize
they're on a new window,

00:38:08.859 --> 00:38:11.659
and they try to hit the back button
and it's not working.

00:38:11.860 --> 00:38:15.760
Letting people know that a new window
or tab opened up is the best thing to do.

00:38:16.449 --> 00:38:21.459
You want to avoid disabling scroll bars
and resizing options because people

00:38:21.460 --> 00:38:27.759
with low vision may need to resize
windows to accommodate larger text.

00:38:28.270 --> 00:38:31.300
Provide no script alternatives.

00:38:32.229 --> 00:38:36.489
This image is an image of a pop-up
where there's a postman pointing

00:38:36.490 --> 00:38:41.259
to the ability to sign up
for an email list.

00:38:44.680 --> 00:38:46.750
Alerts and status messages.

00:38:47.139 --> 00:38:53.409
We want to be able to provide a means
to turn off non-essential alerts.

00:38:57.489 --> 00:38:58.688
If it's not important,

00:38:58.689 --> 00:39:02.259
we want to be able to escape that quickly,
either with the escape button

00:39:02.290 --> 00:39:05.500
or by highlighting focus
on our main content.

00:39:06.040 --> 00:39:09.340
We want to make sure
the use of color and hidden icons

00:39:10.719 --> 00:39:14.469
are not used
as the only means of conveying

00:39:14.500 --> 00:39:15.940
important information

00:39:16.809 --> 00:39:21.220
because remember, some folks won't be able
to distinguish between colors.

00:39:21.864 --> 00:39:28.569
This one is an alert message in Drupal
once you have finished a node.

00:39:28.870 --> 00:39:35.379
You can see it's light green background
with light bluish text.

00:39:35.590 --> 00:39:37.660
Not the most accessible on the planet.

00:39:38.890 --> 00:39:39.720
This doesn't help--

00:39:39.800 --> 00:39:44.919
not only does it help
our visually disabled people,

00:39:45.099 --> 00:39:48.910
but it also helps people who might have
a glare on their screen as well.

00:39:50.410 --> 00:39:54.399
Surprise, surprise, there is a WCAG
around status messages.

00:39:55.120 --> 00:39:58.720
Make sure users are aware
of important changes in content.

00:39:59.080 --> 00:40:01.149
You do that, remember
we talked about this,

00:40:01.149 --> 00:40:03.820
in a way that doesn't interrupt
their workflow.

00:40:03.970 --> 00:40:07.170
That's what makes those things annoying
is when it interrupts us.

00:40:08.350 --> 00:40:11.979
Make sure that you use appropriate roles
and properties assigned

00:40:12.429 --> 00:40:13.749
to status messages.

00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:17.409
The new content is spoken
by the screen reader in such a way

00:40:17.769 --> 00:40:22.058
to assist the blind and low vision users
because most sighted users

00:40:22.059 --> 00:40:25.899
can observe text peripherally
when it's added to our view.

00:40:27.699 --> 00:40:31.300
What are some status messages
that might come up?

00:40:31.719 --> 00:40:34.389
Presenting a message
about the number of search results

00:40:34.389 --> 00:40:35.389
returned.

00:40:35.510 --> 00:40:40.689
Perhaps informing the user
that the application is busy,

00:40:40.690 --> 00:40:42.609
we have to come back later.

00:40:43.509 --> 00:40:48.190
Displaying information about the progress
or the completion of a process.

00:40:48.669 --> 00:40:49.719
That spinning wheel.

00:40:50.069 --> 00:40:54.548
Really simply, this guideline
means that the status message

00:40:54.549 --> 00:40:56.410
should be clearly labeled

00:40:58.000 --> 00:40:59.019
as such

00:40:59.829 --> 00:41:02.679
in the website's code base,
in the code base

00:41:03.039 --> 00:41:06.219
so that the assistive technology,
such as screen readers,

00:41:06.220 --> 00:41:10.150
can identify them and decide
how to relay them to the user.

00:41:10.719 --> 00:41:15.610
People who are native screen reader users
do have settings for that sort of stuff

00:41:15.670 --> 00:41:18.620
or are accustomed on how to use
those rotors and avoid them.

00:41:21.130 --> 00:41:24.729
There's another WCAG guidelines
about input.

00:41:29.700 --> 00:41:31.508
This is about error identification.

00:41:31.509 --> 00:41:32.649
When you come up on a form,

00:41:32.649 --> 00:41:37.718
make sure that people
with cognitive language

00:41:37.719 --> 00:41:40.299
and learning disabilities or people

00:41:40.300 --> 00:41:43.629
who have a difficulty understanding
and knowing what the icons

00:41:43.630 --> 00:41:45.549
and other visual cues are,
so make sure there's

00:41:45.549 --> 00:41:48.549
a couple of ways that they know
that the errors are in there.

00:41:48.910 --> 00:41:51.189
We do like to say we do inline errors.

00:41:51.699 --> 00:41:54.399
Make sure you provide
labels and instructions

00:41:55.480 --> 00:41:58.270
when the content requires user input.

00:41:58.569 --> 00:42:01.059
Make sure that the person knows
that there's something that needs

00:42:01.059 --> 00:42:02.290
to go in that field.

00:42:04.150 --> 00:42:09.759
Provide clear and unambiguous labels
and instructions.

00:42:10.600 --> 00:42:13.241
That helps everybody
and particularly those

00:42:13.291 --> 00:42:14.641
with learning disabilities.

00:42:15.130 --> 00:42:16.178
Error suggestions.

00:42:16.179 --> 00:42:21.158
This is if your input error
is perhaps automatically collected

00:42:21.159 --> 00:42:22.159
and detected.

00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:24.970
Then the suggestions
are provided to the user

00:42:26.380 --> 00:42:31.809
with the exception of if it jeopardizes
the security or purpose of the content.

00:42:32.499 --> 00:42:35.448
Providing information
about how to correct input errors

00:42:35.449 --> 00:42:37.379
for people who have learning disabilities

00:42:37.379 --> 00:42:39.399
to fill out those forms and inputs.

00:42:39.579 --> 00:42:43.029
Most of these are passwords
or Social Security numbers.

00:42:45.459 --> 00:42:49.180
Make sure that they understand

00:42:50.109 --> 00:42:52.570
the nature of the input
and how to correct it.

00:42:53.139 --> 00:42:56.892
People with motion impairment can reduce
the number of times they need to change

00:42:56.892 --> 00:42:58.450
an input value as well.

00:43:00.099 --> 00:43:01.359
What have we learned today?

00:43:01.359 --> 00:43:03.809
Oh, I'm almost at time,
so this is perfect timing.

00:43:05.259 --> 00:43:06.609
What have we learned today?

00:43:06.789 --> 00:43:10.600
We want to be able to allow
our users to copy and paste details

00:43:10.629 --> 00:43:13.209
into our username and password fields.

00:43:13.780 --> 00:43:18.430
We want to allow our users to use
external references for their details,

00:43:18.460 --> 00:43:24.099
either as memory aids
or to avoid transcription errors.

00:43:24.520 --> 00:43:28.359
We want people to be able to enter
data from documents on their computer

00:43:28.360 --> 00:43:29.800
or password managers.

00:43:31.380 --> 00:43:33.309
That goes back to that copy and paste.

00:43:33.489 --> 00:43:36.969
Remember, when we switch screens,
sometimes people lose

00:43:37.689 --> 00:43:40.480
or transpose those numbers.

00:43:41.470 --> 00:43:43.570
Provide users with a method
to authenticate

00:43:43.573 --> 00:43:46.030
that does not involve a password.

00:43:47.769 --> 00:43:50.799
In cases where users
can't remember their password,

00:43:51.009 --> 00:43:55.839
provide an option to send a magic link
to their email where they can click

00:43:55.840 --> 00:43:58.810
on the link and log in that way.

00:43:59.485 --> 00:44:03.219
Also, code your input fields
with the appropriate type.

00:44:04.210 --> 00:44:08.440
Password fields should have
a type that says "Password" on it.

00:44:08.922 --> 00:44:11.770
A number field should have
a type that says "Number".

00:44:12.190 --> 00:44:16.599
Providing that correct input type
allows people who are

00:44:17.229 --> 00:44:18.669
in operating systems,

00:44:19.510 --> 00:44:21.850
but people using assistive technology

00:44:22.689 --> 00:44:27.789
to know what they're expected to input,
the correct method to input.

00:44:30.130 --> 00:44:33.668
Have the ability to prefill fields
where the data is available,

00:44:33.669 --> 00:44:35.469
like if it's stored in your browser.

00:44:35.819 --> 00:44:37.459
How many times
do you go in and you're like,

00:44:37.459 --> 00:44:40.659
"Oh just use the autofill,"
and they don't allow you to autofill,

00:44:40.667 --> 00:44:43.810
so you have to remember your password?

00:44:45.580 --> 00:44:50.018
When using multi-factor authentication,
make sure that your users are given

00:44:50.019 --> 00:44:53.080
advanced warning about the requirements
and the time window.

00:44:53.559 --> 00:44:57.699
Really make sure that there's
enough time provided for them to require

00:44:58.540 --> 00:45:03.070
or to verify their information
without requiring a new code.

00:45:03.630 --> 00:45:05.799
If we do have those short windows,

00:45:06.699 --> 00:45:08.589
provide an accessible alternative.

00:45:09.199 --> 00:45:11.633
Allow users to access requirements

00:45:11.813 --> 00:45:18.186
for multi-factor authentication,
having those different apps available.

00:45:18.357 --> 00:45:20.436
Then two last things on CAPTCHAs.

00:45:21.406 --> 00:45:24.016
Users with visual impairments
may not be able to use

00:45:24.067 --> 00:45:25.193
those image CAPTCHAs.

00:45:25.719 --> 00:45:27.679
There's a picture of a CAPTCHA here,
and you can see

00:45:27.679 --> 00:45:30.319
that there's alternative ways
to use this CAPTCHA.

00:45:30.520 --> 00:45:33.370
There's the option to fill
in the letters as you see them,

00:45:33.610 --> 00:45:37.418
there's the option to change
the letters if you maybe try again

00:45:37.419 --> 00:45:39.160
with a different letter combination.

00:45:39.160 --> 00:45:46.329
There's the ability to hear it,
so you can hear the letters said.

00:45:46.719 --> 00:45:51.509
Then remember not to use
those cultural-specific CAPTCHAs.

00:45:52.300 --> 00:45:53.300
Again,

00:45:53.469 --> 00:45:57.219
the main moral of this presentation
is always provide your users

00:45:57.489 --> 00:45:58.810
with alternatives.

00:45:59.649 --> 00:46:01.749
With that, I'll scroll to the last screen.

00:46:02.200 --> 00:46:04.809
You can find me on LinkedIn
as Volkswagen Chick.

00:46:05.739 --> 00:46:09.879
That's probably the easiest way
and the best way to have

00:46:09.880 --> 00:46:11.410
conversations and that sort of thing.

00:46:11.410 --> 00:46:12.610
I want to thank everyone

00:46:12.689 --> 00:46:13.689
who came.

00:46:13.690 --> 00:46:16.329
I know there was lots of things
happening in the chat,

00:46:16.329 --> 00:46:21.069
but I did not see any of them except
for when that put in migraines.

00:46:21.090 --> 00:46:22.459
[laughter]

00:46:23.890 --> 00:46:27.730
<v Simon> Thanks so much, AmyJune.
That was really helpful and informative.

00:46:28.059 --> 00:46:29.109
We do have

00:46:30.099 --> 00:46:31.719
a few pretty good questions here

00:46:33.489 --> 00:46:37.180
in the Q&amp;A, so I'll go through those.

00:46:40.179 --> 00:46:46.390
David asks, are honeypot fields
in online forms accessible

00:46:46.539 --> 00:46:52.449
when they are designed to block
submission forms from completions

00:46:52.450 --> 00:46:53.679
by abusive bots?

00:46:54.039 --> 00:46:56.799
If so, what accessible alternatives

00:46:57.910 --> 00:46:59.770
are there to stop malicious bots?

00:46:59.949 --> 00:47:04.872
It may be helpful to define
what a honeypot is with this [crosstalk]

00:47:04.922 --> 00:47:07.272
<v AmyJune> I don't know
what a honeypot is exactly

00:47:07.302 --> 00:47:09.392
because I'm not working on that.
<v Simon> Sure.

00:47:09.392 --> 00:47:11.902
<v AmyJune> Go ahead.
<v Simon> Go ahead.

00:47:12.579 --> 00:47:13.990
<v AmyJune> I was just going
to say I know honeypot is

00:47:13.990 --> 00:47:18.669
one of the more productive ways

00:47:20.349 --> 00:47:22.300
for spam prevention

00:47:23.080 --> 00:47:26.409
rather than our CAPTCHAs
and our reCAPTCHAs and stuff like that.

00:47:26.410 --> 00:47:28.040
But that is one
of the more successful ways

00:47:28.040 --> 00:47:29.040
to limit our spam.

00:47:29.710 --> 00:47:33.249
With honeypot, it blocks
that malicious stuff,

00:47:33.250 --> 00:47:37.329
so it really is up to the user
to be able to slow down

00:47:38.139 --> 00:47:39.139
with their input,

00:47:39.489 --> 00:47:41.739
limit their input,
be careful with their input

00:47:42.579 --> 00:47:44.620
because we've all been there
when we've been on a website

00:47:44.620 --> 00:47:47.670
and we just enter it so fast
that they think that we're a bot.

00:47:48.129 --> 00:47:51.229
That's a learning opportunity for us
to slow down a little bit.

00:47:54.219 --> 00:47:55.449
<v Simon> Okay, great.

00:47:57.460 --> 00:48:04.569
Nicole asks, is reCAPTCHA v3
which doesn't involve solving puzzles,

00:48:05.889 --> 00:48:07.239
easier for accessibility?

00:48:08.110 --> 00:48:12.579
<v AmyJune> Yes, but I do recommend just
the button that asks if we're bots.

00:48:16.524 --> 00:48:20.604
The one that just says
the simple checkboxes if you're a bot.

00:48:23.809 --> 00:48:24.809
<v Simon> That's good.

00:48:26.169 --> 00:48:30.430
Someone asks, do you have
any reading recommendations or resources

00:48:30.750 --> 00:48:32.570
for accessible cybersecurity?

00:48:33.452 --> 00:48:40.420
<v AmyJune> Oh, yes,
and I will share a link with that.

00:48:40.480 --> 00:48:42.279
I don't have that offhand.

00:48:42.280 --> 00:48:44.950
I just came across something
the other day when I was doing research

00:48:44.950 --> 00:48:46.792
for the Linux Foundation on cybersecurity.

00:48:46.792 --> 00:48:48.602
There's a whole section
on accessibility,

00:48:48.602 --> 00:48:51.969
but I don't have that
at the top of my tongue.

00:48:53.110 --> 00:48:55.179
There's some really great articles.

00:48:56.380 --> 00:48:58.580
There's a resource
on LinkedIn if you follow.

00:48:59.050 --> 00:49:03.429
It's an accessibility working group,
and I forget the name of it,

00:49:03.430 --> 00:49:06.030
and I know that isn't
a very good thing to be either.

00:49:06.310 --> 00:49:07.509
If you follow a lot of those,

00:49:07.509 --> 00:49:08.959
there's a lot of articles and white papers

00:49:08.959 --> 00:49:12.268
on LinkedIn about cybersecurity
and accessibility.

00:49:12.269 --> 00:49:14.289
It's a brand new thing that's opening up

00:49:14.800 --> 00:49:17.890
as more of us are becoming
cybersecurity experts.

00:49:18.070 --> 00:49:23.455
More of us are moving into cybersecurity
that have accessibility backgrounds.

00:49:23.635 --> 00:49:26.185
There is a lot of really good information
out there.

00:49:27.594 --> 00:49:28.744
<v Simon> Great.
Thank you.

00:49:29.325 --> 00:49:32.024
There are a few more questions,
but we are at time.

00:49:33.750 --> 00:49:34.900
I just want to wrap up.

00:49:35.649 --> 00:49:37.630
Again, thank you, AmyJune,

00:49:38.469 --> 00:49:39.909
for this great presentation,

00:49:41.349 --> 00:49:42.605
and thank you, everyone,

00:49:42.655 --> 00:49:45.789
for being part of this session.

00:49:48.189 --> 00:49:52.419
You can continue this conversation
in the chat or on social media

00:49:53.020 --> 00:50:01.018
using the hashtags
#WPA11YDay and #WPAD2024.

00:50:01.660 --> 00:50:06.639
We would also appreciate it

after the break.

00:50:54.970 --> 00:50:58.839
<v Announcer> Thank you to WordPress
