00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.839
Announcer: 24.

00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:02.479
Accessible Firebrand:

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:06.763
"Why can't I use my brand color there,
and if not there, then where?"

00:00:06.764 --> 00:00:11.959
With speaker Deneb Pulsipher,
Captain Accessible at SeaMonster Studios.

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.480
This presentation
was recorded October 2024.

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:20.559
Marina Weis-Haggerty: Welcome back
to WordPress Accessibility Day 2024.

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.199
Hello to anyone else just joining.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:24.759
My name is Marina,

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:29.282
and I'm a UX/UI developer
from the software agency NuRelm.

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.600
I'll be the MC for this session.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.719
Thank you all for joining us
for Accessible Firebrand.

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.439
Why can't I use my brand color theme?

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.279
If not there, then where?

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.400
With Mark Alvis and Deneb Pulsipher.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.719
Mark is a systems-oriented details guy,

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:52.359
disguised neatly
as a brand and identity designer.

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:53.639
Details matter to Mark.

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.202
Pixels, pantones, and patterns.

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:03.559
Mark brings a love of craft
to his work and a 15 years of experience

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:07.079
designing solutions
from corporate and boutique clients.

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.730
Whether it's product packaging,
brand identity,

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.399
or user interface designed
from Microsoft, Starbucks,

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.119
or even the local coffee
shop down the street,

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:18.959
it's about putting the pieces together

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.679
in a way that is appealing,
but also effective.

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.079
When not drinking coffee
or designing the labels,

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.599
you might find him
moonlighting in Seattle's music

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.250
venues or tucking
his three daughters into bed.

00:01:31.998 --> 00:01:34.079
Now I'm going to introduce Deneb,

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.760
who likes to be called Captain Accessible.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.760
He gets excited about
the inherent ability the web provides

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.959
to let everyone access
the same information,

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.839
whether they're able to see or not,
hear or not, use a mouse or not,

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.679
have no cognitive challenges or do.

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.159
The internet can be accessed

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.839
by nearly everyone
through regular technologies like web

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.079
browsers or accessive
technologies like screen

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.379
readers as long as we code it right.

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.759
Deneb's passion
is to make sure it's coded right,

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.999
which means thoroughly
reviewing all of our own

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.079
sites before we release them to the wild.

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.879
Also sporadically e-mailing owners
of sites he happens

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.878
on while surfing that could use
some accessibility improvements.

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:20.799
Before handing it over to you guys,

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.679
I just have a couple
of housekeeping notes.

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.599
For everyone, please feel free
to add your questions in the Zoom Q&amp;A

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.039
section and we'll answer
them at the end of the session.

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.719
Use the chat to connect
with other attendees.

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.559
Then an important note,
at the end of this session,

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.399
we'll be switching to a new Zoom link.

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.919
This is to ensure the live captioning
and ASL feeds don't expire.

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.839
Refer to your original
Zoom webinar e-mail from WordPress

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.920
Accessibility Day
has all four session links.

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:53.239
Toward the end of the hour,

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:56.159
you should receive
a reminder e-mail from us.

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.239
That's all for me for now.

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.637
Take it away, Mark and Deneb.

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.159
Mark Alvis: Thank you very much.I'm
going to get my screen

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:09.999
going here and we're going to get
this going forward.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.400
As you can see here, Accessible Firebrand.

00:03:15.574 --> 00:03:18.319
Deneb, I'm going to let you start
and then I'm going to jump in here.

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:19.799
Why don't you go for it?

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:23.439
Deneb Pulsipher: All right.
We both work at SeaMonster Studios.

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:28.439
I love accessibility and I'm teaching
Mark to also love accessibility.

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.120
We're having fun.

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.319
My official title at SeaMonster
Studios is Captain Accessible.

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:36.960
I do enjoy that.

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.760
Mark is just an amazing brand guy.

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.760
Mark: Yes, thank you.

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:51.279
Essentially, we are the team that works
together at SeaMonster

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.560
Studios and we do web
design and accessibility.

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.039
We've had an awesome chance to build

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.599
our partnership the past couple years,
and you know what?

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:07.199
We've come across some things
that we want to share with you guys today.

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.679
Basically what we're going
to be sharing, number one,

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.759
we've seen that there can sometimes
be an unfortunate tug

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:18.480
of war between accessibility and design.

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:19.679
Why is that?

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.911
We're going to get into it.

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:25.679
Number two, we're going to go
through some pain points for both sides.

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.239
We're going to see some common
pitfalls that we can run into.

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:31.559
Then also we're going to give you guys

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.919
some tools to help you persuade
your boss or the brand manager

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:37.799
to make some of the change
that you need to do.

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.239
Then we're going to give
you three takeaways

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:43.524
to present your case
to your boss or the brand manager.

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:46.759
Deneb, why don't you kick us off here?

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:47.639
Deneb: Okay.

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:50.799
On this slide,
we have branding plus accessibility,

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.639
a match made in heaven.

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:55.979
Really, I think
it should be a match made in heaven

00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:00.179
because what brand people
want to do is make sure

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:04.360
that they get
into the hearts of the visitors.

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:06.779
Accessibility people,
what they want to do is make sure

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:12.239
that every visitor has a chance to get
it into their heart as well.

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:16.959
If you'll go to the next slide,
we see some of the problems here.

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:18.599
On this slide, we have a picture of,

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:22.439
I don't know if you guys remember
those "I'm a PC, I'm a Mac"

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:24.599
commercials from several years ago.

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:28.559
It's an image of a kind
of a person standing

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.399
there in a nice buttoned-up suit

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:34.680
and tie and really formal
looking and he's the PC.

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:36.359
Then the Mac guy is just kind of sitting

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:42.160
there with his casual jeans
and a turtleneck or something.

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:46.640
Oftentimes this epitomizes a difference.

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:49.919
We've got these two unique perspectives

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:53.039
that are trying
to interact with each other.

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:56.279
I think, unfortunately,
that's how it can feel working

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:58.919
between brand guys and accessibility guys.

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:01.482
If you'll go to the next slide.

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:03.839
Mark: Even to add
to that before we do that is,

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:06.599
it's not just brand and accessibility.

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:08.679
You see this everywhere in life.

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:11.479
You've got a whole bunch
of different sides.

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:16.796
We create these platforms
and we create these silos and these walls.

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:18.719
Let's keep going here.

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:21.959
Deneb: On this side,
we've got two circles,

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:24.999
different colors, but inside,
one of them has branding,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.719
the other one has accessibility.

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:30.020
It shows that these two ideas

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:34.040
generally function in their own spheres.

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:36.799
We're going to try to kind of break
that down through the presentation,

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:42.760
but standard, the way things have been,
they function in their own spheres.

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:48.359
If you go to the next slide,
often what happens is these two ideas

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:51.439
or these two paradigms
are pitted against each other.

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:54.759
We have a versus in between
these two circles now.

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:58.079
Even worse than that,
the next slide shows sometimes.

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:00.099
Now we have swords coming out

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:03.039
of these two circles
and they're clashing swords

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:08.679
because sometimes
that's what it feels when a brand person

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:15.039
is trying to communicate his values
and needs and an accessibility person

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:18.769
is trying to communicate
his needs or her needs.

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:24.125
It's where we find ourselves,
but let's get past that.

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:27.059
Mark: I think what it comes
down to is it's a tug-of-war

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:29.919
between two different priorities, right?

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:34.279
The designer is wanting
to make things beautiful and a functional,

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:38.679
wonderful experience and then
for the accessibility professional,

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:40.679
it's all about, is the content accessible?

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:41.969
Is it usable?

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:44.639
There are common ground,
but at the end of the day,

00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:48.359
sometimes it ends up being, "I'm right.

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:53.159
As the designer, I've got the education,
whatever, experience."

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:57.479
Then on the other side, the accessible
partner is, "Hey, I'm right.

00:07:57.480 --> 00:07:59.639
We know what we're talking about."

00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:02.999
Unfortunately,
we just get into these silos.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.719
The goal is that there's ways
to break through this,

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:08.599
and we're going to get
into that a little bit.

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:10.440
This next slide,

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:15.399
let's talk about how we deal
with talking to someone like me,

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:17.301
who is a brand manager.

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:20.639
You guys may or not remember this guy.

00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:24.559
He has got his finger pointed up.

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:27.839
It's a middle-aged stern man,
and he's saying,

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:31.079
if you remember the line,
"No soup for you."

00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:35.880
Obviously, this is from Seinfeld
and it's a classic episode.

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:38.559
Sometimes this is what it's
like when you're dealing

00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:42.479
with a designer or when you're dealing
with the brand manager.

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:44.799
They don't want you
to touch their colors, right?

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:47.114
We call them the brand Nazi.

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:52.484
We're poking a little bit of fun there,
but why is this?

00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:57.060
Why do brand people get so uppity

00:08:57.460 --> 00:09:00.105
and so huffy about their colors?

00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:03.359
I'd like to dive
into that a little bit and share

00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:05.096
my side of the story.

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:07.519
The first thing we need to think about

00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:10.420
is that it's all about the priority.

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:14.039
The priority for us
is we want to deliver a unique,

00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:18.280
memorable, and also
a consistent brand experience.

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:21.640
We do that through color primarily.

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:24.479
Here's a couple examples.

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:25.939
Number one, here's a slide

00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:28.750
with four different sets of boxes,

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:35.640
brown, yellow, purple,
orange, red, blue, yellow, red.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.159
If I were to ask you, and tell
you that these are actually four logos.

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:43.879
Now, what industry
do you think that they come from?

00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:47.399
I'm going to plot twist
and give away the answer here,

00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:51.960
but we've got black-and-white
versions of the companies.

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:56.160
It's UPS, FedEx, Postal Service, and DHL.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.332
Now you see when
it's just black and white,

00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:03.599
they just group together,
and there's unity there between them.

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:07.599
If you squint your eyes,
it just looks like some shapes.

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:10.279
Now, look when I add the color in there.

00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:14.559
Boom, immediately you can see
that the brown and yellow with UPS,

00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:19.919
it immediately distinguishes itself
from FedEx, which is right next to it.

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:23.919
The use of color
as a categorical differentiator

00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:28.046
in brand design is incredibly
powerful and important.

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:31.572
Color gives important
identity information.

00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:33.759
Another example of how we use color

00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:37.999
is that we use it for scannability
and creating visual hierarchy.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:43.159
On this screen, we've got
three rows of light gray text that says,

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:45.479
"Read me, read me, read me, read me,"

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:48.480
but where did your eye go to?

00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:51.359
Obviously, your eye
went to the left column

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:53.759
where the third one down says,
"Made you look,"

00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:57.000
in a small red bold font.

00:10:58.160 --> 00:10:59.039
Why is that?

00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:01.199
The "Read me" text was 45 point.

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:04.759
It's much bigger,
and the red text is only 16 point.

00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:06.479
It's way smaller but obviously,

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:11.459
our brain is fine-tuned to look

00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:15.120
for danger or any type of warning.

00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:18.157
We're drawn to the color red.

00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:23.399
We got to be aware of that in terms
of the scannability with colors.

00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:27.199
Another example is you can use color tones

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:32.760
within the same color to create
a sense of vibe or beauty.

00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:36.599
It's really the nuance
between the color that does that.

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:40.884
In this example,
I've just taken some beautiful artwork

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:47.240
that is a throwback to like a 1900s
Parisian artistry.

00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:48.559
You can see it's beautiful.

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:51.159
They use a similar color palette,

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:55.560
but they use tones
in between the different ones.

00:11:56.880 --> 00:12:02.599
The next point is that we use
color for brand perception,

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:06.199
and it's really built into our psychology.

00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:10.319
On this slide, you can see
there are three logos on the left,

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:12.439
Starbucks, McDonald's, and Burger King.

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:17.679
Then opposing side, there's three logos,
IRS, Postal Service, and IBM.

00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:21.959
The ones on the left are very vibrant
and colorful and full of life,

00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:24.687
and honestly, they're appetizing.

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:26.399
Now you look on the ones on the right,

00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:32.839
they're formal, casual,
dare I say boring, but at least you know

00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:35.879
that if you are going to
one of those companies,

00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:41.434
there's going to be a sense of sturdiness
and solid and all that stuff.

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:47.319
Color psychology plays a major role
in how consumers make decisions,

00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:50.039
and actually up to 90%
of the initial impression

00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:52.160
comes from color itself.

00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:55.559
It's a big deal when we set colors,

00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:58.972
we don't want to mess
with those very often.

00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:02.440
Just to boil that down here,

00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:04.999
some of the pain points
is that as a designer,

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.967
I am taught what correct
ratios are supposed to be.

00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:14.399
Even in my natural personality,
my whole life,

00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:18.279
I've been a detailed person, and I know
what looks good and what doesn't,

00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:20.319
and we have an eye for it.

00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:22.359
When we're told that, "Hey, you know what,

00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:24.599
the design that you did, it's beautiful,

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:26.559
but it does not meet the standards,"

00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:29.319
sometimes our ego can get in the way.

00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:32.573
That's a bummer, but that's part of life.

00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:34.418
We have to avoid that.

00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:37.279
Number two, sometimes
it's not the designer,

00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:39.639
it can actually be the company owner.

00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:42.539
Maybe you have a CEO who is just dead set

00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:45.439
on using lime green
as the main brand color,

00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:49.239
and it just causes all kinds
of problems in terms of functionality.

00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:54.039
He wants that as the main headline color,
and that just doesn't work.

00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:57.119
Number three, as a designer,

00:13:57.120 --> 00:14:01.719
we put so much time and effort
into creating these designs

00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:06.239
using color to create hierarchy
and nuance and all that stuff.

00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:11.640
If I'm being told to make the fonts
black and the background white,

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:15.239
there goes my well-crafted
color hierarchy.

00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:17.879
Sometimes it can be a bummer,
and that's just a fear of mine.

00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:18.919
I want to create beauty,

00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:22.999
and I don't want to just
make everything black and white.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.893
Those are a few of the pain points.

00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:31.715
Everyone has those on their own
side and there's truth to both sides.

00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:34.559
How do we overcome this?

00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:37.839
If companies are spending
tens of thousands,

00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:42.879
sometimes hundreds of thousands
of dollars to brand their company,

00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:46.768
why can't we just use
the brand colors everywhere?

00:14:47.269 --> 00:14:48.839
Deneb, so I'm going
to throw it back to you.

00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:53.040
What do you think about what I said here?

00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:57.652
Deneb: I think it's an important question.

00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:00.479
I was super glad that the market agreed

00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:03.119
to do this presentation
with me because I think

00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:07.319
it's important that we understand
where the brand site is coming from.

00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:12.959
This is the final question
that they can have in their mind is,

00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:14.999
"I put all this effort into it.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:16.488
Let me use it."

00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:18.439
If you go to the next slide,

00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:20.739
let me tell you the priority

00:15:20.740 --> 00:15:23.219
for accessibility professions.

00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:26.679
Our priority is is similar in many ways.

00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:32.039
In fact, we want to get the content out
to the people who are coming to the site.

00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:37.039
We want to create fully accessible
content for all users equally.

00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:40.239
That's really the goal from
an accessibility perspective,

00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:42.439
which is really when you think about it,

00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:46.920
it's the same as a goal
from the brand perspective.

00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:49.400
We all want to do it.

00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:53.999
The way we do it has changed a little,

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:58.599
or at least there are some standards
that guide how we need to do this.

00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:01.399
If you'll go to the next page, Mark.

00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:02.919
I want to run through just

00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:09.120
really quickly the history of color
accessibility standards.

00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:12.959
In 1991 was when the first websites
started coming out,

00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:16.054
and at that point, they were just text.

00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:18.119
That's all you got.

00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:20.799
The user could maybe
change the color of the text,

00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:24.279
they could change the background,
maybe, but the creator

00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:26.759
of the website couldn't
do anything about that.

00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:28.159
It was just the text.

00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:34.320
If you go to the next, in '96,
you see, CSS1 was introduced.

00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:40.400
With CSS, now all of a sudden,
the developers could style their text

00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:42.479
and they could style their background,

00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:45.574
and they could do whatever they wanted.

00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:48.242
For several years, right, then,

00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:53.000
styling on the web was like the Wild West,

00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:56.239
the developers did whatever they wanted
because they thought it was cool,

00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:58.359
or the designers designed
however they wanted,

00:16:58.360 --> 00:16:59.319
because they thought it was cool.

00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:03.239
They didn't have any standards
to guide how they did that.

00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:06.380
Next point says that in 1999,

00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:10.679
WCAG 1.0 came out,

00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:15.800
the Web Content Accessibility
Guidelines in the first version.

00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:22.359
This was a great step
but in terms of the actual standards,

00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:24.040
it was pretty weak.

00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:28.199
It says the standard for color
at that point

00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:31.559
was that the foreground and background
color combinations should provide

00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:34.319
enough contrast when viewed
by someone having color

00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:37.959
deficits or when viewed
on a black-and-white screen.

00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:40.039
It's a little nebulous
what that even means.

00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:45.519
In fact, they had a quick test
appended to WCAG 1.0,

00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:48.019
that said that the recommended way
to check on this

00:17:48.020 --> 00:17:50.719
to make sure that it met these guidelines

00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:55.380
was that the web developer
ought to print off

00:17:55.420 --> 00:17:58.719
a page of the website on
a black-and-white printer,

00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:00.786
and then go photocopy it.

00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:02.759
Then go photocopy
the thing that came from that,

00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:04.359
and then do that a few times,

00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:07.759
and then hold it up and see
if they could still read it.

00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:13.200
It's this crazy standard,
but it was at least a place to start.

00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:18.379
Next slide shows that the next version

00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:21.360
of WCAG 2.0 came out in 2008.

00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:23.199
That's where the familiar standard,

00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:29.280
which most people hopefully know about,
is that the contrast ratio

00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:32.219
between the foreground or the text

00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:34.659
and the background needs to be 4.5:1,

00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:38.519
meaning the text needs
to be four and a half times

00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:44.040
brighter or darker than the background,
in order to be fully legible.

00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:50.319
That was 2.0 in WCAG 2.0,
and also 2.1 adopted that same standard,

00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:55.175
also 2.2 adopted that standard,
though if you go to the next point,

00:18:55.176 --> 00:19:00.760
WCAG 3.0 is rumored,
at least in the draft,

00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:03.599
it looks like they're going to adopt

00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:08.280
the APCA values
instead of contrast ratios.

00:19:09.214 --> 00:19:11.880
APCA is a complex topic.

00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:14.039
I don't fully understand it.

00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:16.139
If you do want to understand it,
you want to get into it,

00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:21.079
go to the Axon towards
the beginning of the year.

00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:23.759
They had a great session on this,
so you can check that out.

00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:27.727
I also have a link to that
in our notes at the end.

00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:29.879
If you go to the next slide,

00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:35.279
the real issue
is that with any of these standards

00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:39.439
is that it's problematic
to use some brand colors,

00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:43.519
like if you've got
a flaming yellow or green,

00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:46.599
really light color,
it's problematic to use that color

00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:50.160
in most situations for accessible content.

00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:54.619
For example, let's look at a brand color

00:19:54.620 --> 00:19:59.000
that's easily recognizable, Coca-Cola.

00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:03.919
Mark, would you tell us what you see
in this giant Coca-Cola label?

00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:05.999
Mark: Right, so as a logo designer,

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.839
I would say there's a ton of personality,
there's a ton of contrast,

00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:12.839
it pops off the screen against the white.

00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:15.359
I would say this is a historic logo,

00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:19.119
been around since late 1800s,
I think it looks great.

00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:23.166
What about for building
content around these colors?

00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:24.999
Deneb: Great question.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.959
In this slide,
we still have the logo there,

00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:30.159
but now we're looking at the actual color,

00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:34.858
this Coca-Cola red,
very recognizable, f40000,

00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:38.519
and the contrast ratio that that color

00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:43.020
has against the white
background is 4.33:1.

00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:47.679
Remember, the WCAG guidelines
say that the contrast ratio

00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:50.820
for text needs to be 4.5:1.

00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:54.720
If you're going to use this on text,

00:20:55.160 --> 00:21:01.550
or use this as a color in your text,
it wouldn't work, it fails that.

00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:06.119
Let's look real quick
at just one other example.

00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:12.279
In this next page, we've got Burger King,
the old logo for Burger King.

00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:15.559
Now tell me just
a little bit about this old

00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:17.319
logo that changed several years ago.

00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:22.279
Mark: Right, so again, as a logo designer,
you're wanting to make it pop,

00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:24.039
you're wanting to have lots of contrast,

00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:28.320
I see primary colors of blue,
yellow, and red.

00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:33.960
I think it does the job as a logo,
but obviously, it can be dated.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:38.759
In terms of building
content from these colors,

00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:41.639
what do you have to say about that?

00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:46.799
Deneb: The problem with this old
logo was the yellow and even the red.

00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:49.799
The red is almost the same color
as the Coca-Cola red, which means

00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:54.239
it's just a little shy of
the guidelines in terms

00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:57.360
of being able to use it in content.

00:21:57.646 --> 00:21:59.580
It's 4.3:1.

00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:02.299
The yellow is just 1.87:1,

00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:05.519
so you definitely
couldn't use that in content.

00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:08.040
The blue-on-white does work

00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:10.199
but then Burger King did
something interesting.

00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:13.319
If you go to the next slide,
this shows their new logo.

00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:17.839
Notice the orange color is a little darker

00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:20.079
than their yellow
was from the previous one,

00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:22.559
and the red color is darker as well.

00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:25.919
The whole thing is set
on this tan background,

00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:29.279
which actually means
that the red on tan and the orange on tan,

00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:33.880
neither of those could actually
be used in content either.

00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:39.039
The next slide shows
that though these are still problematic,

00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:42.848
this color migration did
something cool for them.

00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:46.819
It paved the way for them
to include a new accessible color

00:22:46.820 --> 00:22:49.679
that if you go to
the next slide, this brown,

00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:53.399
this is a snapshot
of their site right now.

00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:57.526
See how they use that brown
color in a lot of places.

00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:04.760
By migrating the colors of their brand,

00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:10.439
they were able to introduce this color
that's very, very useful to them.

00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:15.121
In fact, interestingly,
notice this button is their new red.

00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:17.179
I told you that against tan
it doesn't work,

00:23:17.180 --> 00:23:22.739
but the button text is actually white

00:23:22.740 --> 00:23:26.072
and against white,
that red color can work.

00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:29.519
They're fudging it a little bit,

00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:32.039
but they're using it in an accessible way,

00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:34.940
which I think is really pretty cool.

00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:38.279
Then the next slide just shows
kind of more details about that.

00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:43.360
The brown has a tremendous contrast ratio.

00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:46.919
Go ahead on the next slide
if you want to, Mark.

00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:47.859
Mark: All right.

00:23:47.860 --> 00:23:52.079
We saw how logos can work
great in terms of color,

00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:56.879
but when you're building the content,
it's a different animal.

00:23:56.880 --> 00:24:02.159
What do the rules actually say
about text from a logo or brand name?

00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:03.119
Deneb: That is a good question.

00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:06.179
On the next slide, we have WCAG 2.0

00:24:06.180 --> 00:24:09.799
success criterion 1.4.3
says text that is part

00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:13.846
of a logo or brand name
has no contrast requirement.

00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:19.919
Mark: Brand colors don't need
to be accessible, right?

00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:20.879
Deneb: Not quite.

00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:22.399
There is a caveat.

00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:29.160
The content does need to follow
those accessibility guidelines.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.039
That's the heart of the issue here

00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:36.759
is we're looking at the fact that we need

00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:43.240
to distinguish between brand
colors and content colors, essentially.

00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:47.122
If you'll go to the next slide,

00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:50.399
we'll see that we're talking about

00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:52.479
the Web Content
Accessibility Guideline here.

00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:55.399
The content is the important thing.

00:24:55.400 --> 00:25:02.119
To go to what that is, we've got
basically what content is any information

00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:05.056
that's communicated through the site.

00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:11.720
Let's look at the separation of content

00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:15.459
and branding real quick.

00:25:15.460 --> 00:25:17.196
Go ahead to the next.

00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:18.779
Mark: Right.

00:25:18.780 --> 00:25:22.099
What we did is we're separating
now the idea

00:25:22.100 --> 00:25:25.000
of brand color versus content color.

00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:29.679
Let's take a look back
at our friend Coca-Cola.

00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:33.239
The branding of it is the packaging,

00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:36.479
the logos, the can design, all that stuff.

00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:40.999
The content/UI, obviously,
is the content on the website,

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:45.599
the buttons, the titles,
the container boxes, et cetera.

00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:48.599
If you look at their website,
it looks great.

00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:52.559
It's still a branded experience
because they're using

00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:55.439
the pictures of the cans as artwork,

00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:59.566
and yet they've separated
the content in its own box.

00:25:59.751 --> 00:26:02.759
Not dialogue box, but its own container.

00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:05.520
Again, separating the two.

00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:11.239
Deneb: Looking back
at this previous slide that we did,

00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:13.119
what is an example of content?

00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:16.611
I've got four that you guys
need to focus on.

00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:17.779
Paragraphs.

00:26:17.780 --> 00:26:23.175
paragraph text needs to meet
that content color requirement of 4.5:1.

00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:26.839
The headings need to meet that.

00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:28.079
Links and buttons.

00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:31.919
Now, over the next several slides,
let's look very quickly over some sites

00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:35.159
that maybe don't follow
those best practices.

00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:38.839
The first slide here,
we've got showing some headings

00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:42.886
that is in their brand
orange that they really love.

00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:46.679
Unfortunately, the orange
has a contrast ratio of just 2:1,

00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:50.059
which many people
with good eyesight are not going

00:26:50.060 --> 00:26:53.159
to have trouble reading
but if there are some challenges,

00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:58.019
some contrast sensitivity challenges
there, can you go on to the next?

00:26:58.020 --> 00:26:59.408
How about now?

00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:03.452
Can you still read
what those headings say?

00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:07.479
All I did, I took the same
image and I just decreased

00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:11.595
the contrast of that image by 67%

00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:17.839
which is actually
the same reduction, generally,

00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:23.080
of contrast sensitivity that people
see between ages 20 and 60.

00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:25.839
We'll talk a little bit about
that later on.

00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:30.399
Just notice how difficult it is to read
those headings.

00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:35.478
In the next slide, we see
the same kind of issue, but with links.

00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:40.479
We've got some links
that have a lower contrast ratio

00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:44.119
and then some text even below them
that have an even lower one.

00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:46.021
These need to be fixed.

00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:49.959
They're just problematic.

00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:54.279
Then our last example here
is going to be with a button.

00:27:54.280 --> 00:27:57.319
This button is a yellow button
with white text.

00:27:57.320 --> 00:28:00.467
I suspect that the reason they had
that yellow button and white text

00:28:00.468 --> 00:28:03.219
was because they thought
the button would pop out

00:28:03.220 --> 00:28:06.120
and the text makes it pop even more.

00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:11.719
My question is,
does that white-on-yellow really pop?

00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:15.119
If you'll go to next slide,
it says, how about now?

00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:18.359
Once again, I decreased
the contrast and you see

00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:22.119
it's very difficult to read
what that button says

00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:25.373
now with that contrast a little bit less.

00:28:26.120 --> 00:28:29.199
I know that we're preaching
to the choir, right?

00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:32.879
You guys are all here because you love
accessibility and you want

00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:38.275
to make sure that your WordPress
sites are as accessible as possible.

00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:40.839
You're faced
with this secondary question here.

00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:44.479
How do I persuade my boss
or my brand manager?

00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:48.240
I have Mark talk a little bit about this.

00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:50.759
What takeaways do you have, Mark?

00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:51.619
Mark: Great.

00:28:51.620 --> 00:28:54.519
We got three takeaways again for you guys.

00:28:54.520 --> 00:28:58.319
The first of those three really comes
down to the data.

00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:00.000
data tells a story.

00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:03.719
Now, if we take a look at this example,

00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:06.656
this is an example of colorblindness.

00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:08.999
the photos on the right, on the top right,

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:12.359
you have just a regular photo
of green and red apples.

00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:15.239
Now on the bottom right,
you've got the same picture,

00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:18.000
but simulated as colorblindness.

00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:23.159
You can see that you can no longer
easily distinguish between the two.

00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:24.859
There's a lot of stats on this.

00:29:24.860 --> 00:29:27.680
Deneb, what are the stats on this?

00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:30.019
Deneb: The reason
why you might want to show

00:29:30.020 --> 00:29:33.479
an image like this and present
the statistics to your boss

00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:35.599
is because I think
it drives the point home.

00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:40.043
The statistic is that 4.25%
of all people are colorblind.

00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:47.120
That's basically 1 in 12 biological
men and 1 in 200 biological women.

00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:49.320
Ends up being 4.25%.

00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:54.079
That's over all people that are out
there and all people online.

00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:56.160
That's a lot of people.

00:29:56.280 --> 00:30:02.072
so present this stat and I think
you can get some traction with your boss.

00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:08.640
Mark: The next one here is poor eyesight
or myopia or nearsightedness.

00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:12.559
You can see on the right-hand side,
top right, you've got a normal image.

00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:17.120
On the bottom right,
someone who has myopia.

00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:23.043
Tell me a little bit more about
the stats on this, Deneb.

00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:26.099
Deneb: Across demographics that I found,

00:30:26.100 --> 00:30:32.039
30% of people have myopia
in the world or I think it's in the world.

00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:33.359
It might be in just America,

00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:38.834
but that's still a lot of people
wearing glasses, for nearsightedness.

00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:44.319
there was a study done that showed
that there's an inverse relationship

00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:50.079
between contrast sensitivity and myopia,
meaning the more myopic you are,

00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:53.174
the less contrast sensitivity you have.

00:30:54.800 --> 00:31:00.433
That means that sensitivity has gone
down in that entire 30% population.

00:31:01.780 --> 00:31:02.979
Mark: That's a lot.

00:31:02.980 --> 00:31:06.840
The next example
is just plain out poor eyesight.

00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:10.199
As we age, our retina gets a little older,

00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:12.439
or if we're sick or something like that.

00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:13.919
Just to illustrate that purpose,

00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:17.159
the picture on the right
is your standard old

00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:20.719
Honda that you drove
in high school or something like that.

00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:25.999
Over the years, the headlamp gets
the UV damage to it and it yellows

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:29.263
and it gets a lot harder
to see through that.

00:31:29.264 --> 00:31:32.320
Deneb, what are some stats on aging?

00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:37.679
Deneb: The same thing happens
to your cornea, it turns out.

00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:39.839
Actually, it yellows as well.

00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:42.599
As it yellows, less light comes in.

00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:46.679
The stat is that the amount
of light reaching

00:31:46.680 --> 00:31:52.000
your retina declines 67%
between ages 20 and 60.

00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:54.479
That's a significant amount

00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:57.359
of light that isn't making
it to your retina,

00:31:57.360 --> 00:32:00.679
that influences the contrast sensitivity.

00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:02.581
It's a whole lot lower.

00:32:03.820 --> 00:32:04.659
That's it.

00:32:04.660 --> 00:32:09.400
16% of the population
are above 60, I guess.

00:32:10.680 --> 00:32:14.719
I've got a pie chart on this slide
showing 16% aging retina,

00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:18.979
30% myopia, 4.25% colorblindness.

00:32:18.980 --> 00:32:24.040
That leads to only 49.75%
having standard eyesight.

00:32:24.120 --> 00:32:26.351
If we go to the next slide,

00:32:26.546 --> 00:32:33.546
this shows that over 50.25% of visitors

00:32:33.780 --> 00:32:40.080
to any site have some sort
of visual impairment.

00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:45.999
The question that you can ask
your boss or your brand manager,

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:50.960
do we really want to serve
the 4.25% the 33% the 16%?

00:32:52.080 --> 00:32:55.799
Do we want the business and goodwill
of this half of our visitors?

00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:59.760
I think probably the answer
will be, yes, we do.

00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:02.919
Mark: That's great. Great point.

00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:06.919
Number two, we can talk
about a little peer pressure.

00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:09.839
All right. Everyone's doing it.

00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:11.880
You know you want to.

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:14.639
In my time at some of these companies,

00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:16.799
I've had a chance to look
at the brand guides

00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:19.693
and the human interface guidelines.

00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:20.879
They've done a great job.

00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:24.699
A lot of these major brands
have migrated to more accessible colors

00:33:24.700 --> 00:33:26.959
over the years and they've stuck with it.

00:33:26.960 --> 00:33:30.600
Microsoft, Apple, Coca-Cola, Burger King.

00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:33.679
Just looking at Apple's website
from a little while ago,

00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:36.079
you can see they still
have beautiful imagery

00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:40.599
that they use, but they separate
out the content and the headline

00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:43.559
and the subheading and the buttons.

00:33:43.560 --> 00:33:45.874
They are separate from that.

00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:51.419
Then looking at Microsoft,
what they do is they have a content box

00:33:51.420 --> 00:33:53.639
on top of the beautiful imagery.

00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:55.919
Again, separating out those two things,

00:33:55.920 --> 00:33:59.039
making sure there's clear enough contrast.

00:33:59.040 --> 00:34:01.199
Then on the other side of the spectrum,

00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:04.532
Baskin-Robbins, they use the bright color.

00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:07.399
It's not just black and white type.

00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:09.639
They've got lots of personality here,

00:34:09.640 --> 00:34:12.599
but they use a dark brown content box.

00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:17.559
Then even in their hero image,
they have a lot of the bright contrast

00:34:17.560 --> 00:34:19.119
between the pink and the white.

00:34:19.120 --> 00:34:21.199
Then they've set up
their color scheme to work

00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:25.326
so that all three triangulate
and they work together.

00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:30.135
The third one we'd like to talk about,

00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:32.839
it's called the magic of tint and shades.

00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:38.076
As a brand designer, one thing
that we create is a color step ramp.

00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:41.279
Basically, the main point is,

00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:43.439
what I want to bring
to your guys' attention,

00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:45.679
everything digital that we're creating,

00:34:45.680 --> 00:34:50.282
it's just our best guess
at recreating the world around us.

00:34:51.720 --> 00:34:56.399
When you think about the world,
you look down at the ground,

00:34:56.400 --> 00:34:59.239
there's a whole bunch
of shadows and lights

00:34:59.240 --> 00:35:01.199
and highlights and all that stuff.

00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:04.799
It's not just one color and yet in brand,

00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:09.519
we try to get everything just
in this jail of these certain colors.

00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:13.566
I really think there's more wiggle
room around that.

00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:16.159
Who of you guys remember this?

00:35:17.057 --> 00:35:20.879
In 2020, it was that whole
controversy that went viral about,

00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:25.085
is this dress white and gold,
or is it blue and black?

00:35:25.400 --> 00:35:28.919
It was this crazy phenomenon
where it really depended

00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:32.359
on how you were viewing
the photo on the screen.

00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:35.692
Were you seeing
it with or black around it?

00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:38.279
Our eyes have different
sensitivities based

00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:41.599
on the amount of cones
that we have in them.

00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:43.479
Just to break that down,

00:35:43.480 --> 00:35:47.447
let's say someone
has a more yellow-leaning vision,

00:35:47.480 --> 00:35:50.240
they're seeing it that way.

00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:53.199
Then on the other side of it,
they're seeing a different way,

00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:56.480
but really it's the exact same color.

00:35:57.280 --> 00:36:02.319
Our perception of color
is really at the mercy

00:36:02.320 --> 00:36:04.634
of some different variables.

00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:08.612
First and foremost,
the lighting around it.

00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:13.279
The accuracy of our perception
of a color depends

00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:16.560
on the conditions that play around it.

00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:19.679
For example, highlights and shadows.

00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:23.759
For this example, I've got
a single piece of paper on the left.

00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:25.579
You can see that it's in the sunlight

00:36:25.580 --> 00:36:28.559
and there's shadows that are cast over it.

00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:29.999
It's not really a trick.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:32.799
This is really what we're looking at.

00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:35.759
If we were to really dissect this down,

00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:38.919
that single piece of paper
is creating two colors.

00:36:38.920 --> 00:36:43.239
You've got the light gray,
which technically is white,

00:36:43.240 --> 00:36:48.199
and then you've got the dark gray,
which is the white plus shadow.

00:36:48.200 --> 00:36:49.919
You see that in nature as well.

00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:52.699
With this image, you've got leaves

00:36:52.700 --> 00:36:55.639
that have shadow
and sunlight on top of them.

00:36:55.640 --> 00:36:59.439
Again, the color of the leaf
in the sunlight is light green

00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:01.359
and the color of the leaf in
the shadows is dark green,

00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:03.261
but it's the same leaf.

00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:09.640
We can apply that exact same
principle to the use of brand colors.

00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:13.679
We do this through what we call
tint and shade ramps.

00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:16.080
Now, as a brand designer,

00:37:16.440 --> 00:37:22.079
the goal of this is to build
a versatile tonal system of tints

00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:26.360
and shades that we can basically call
approved colors.

00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:30.439
It's a workaround that if we need
some more accessible

00:37:30.440 --> 00:37:33.479
colors and they're not in the brand guide,

00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:36.379
we can maybe present
this option to them and say,

00:37:36.380 --> 00:37:39.950
"Hey, let's look
at it from this perspective."

00:37:40.040 --> 00:37:44.799
Again, back to our example,
sunlight is basically like the brand color

00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:49.639
plus 20% white or whatever,
and then the shadow on the leaf is brand

00:37:49.640 --> 00:37:52.439
color plus 20% black or whatever.

00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:56.804
As an example,
this is what a tint ramp could look like.

00:37:56.920 --> 00:38:00.559
You've got your primary color,
it's just a bucket of paint basically,

00:38:00.560 --> 00:38:02.791
and then you add 20% white,

00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:06.159
it brings it up another 20%
now you're at 40%

00:38:06.160 --> 00:38:08.970
and it goes all the way up to 100.

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:14.159
This is a six-step tint ramp,
and then this is a six-step shade ramp.

00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:16.839
Again, you've got the brand color,

00:38:16.840 --> 00:38:20.839
you add 20% steps
until it gets to the darker colors.

00:38:20.840 --> 00:38:22.679
You're still within the brand color,

00:38:22.680 --> 00:38:26.199
and yet we're using
the principle of shading

00:38:26.200 --> 00:38:29.319
or lighting in order
to alter that a little bit.

00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:32.319
This is a real-life example of a tint ramp

00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:34.439
that we made for a SeaMonster customer,

00:38:34.440 --> 00:38:36.119
and they had a really vibrant color

00:38:36.120 --> 00:38:39.399
scheme with all of these different colors.

00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:43.759
I made this ramp and we were able to use
all of these colors

00:38:43.760 --> 00:38:48.480
in approved areas
and it helped us tremendously.

00:38:49.720 --> 00:38:54.439
Now we're at the point where hopefully
we've talked you into it,

00:38:54.440 --> 00:38:58.239
but the question is,
where can we use the original brand colors

00:38:58.240 --> 00:39:02.199
if now we have to just make things
black and white or whatever?

00:39:02.200 --> 00:39:04.959
The short answer is,
it's basically anywhere

00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:07.191
that's not content-bearing.

00:39:07.640 --> 00:39:11.839
Artwork, photography,
color bars, all that stuff.

00:39:11.840 --> 00:39:14.639
The longer, more complicated
answer is it's up

00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:17.972
to you and your brand
team to work through,

00:39:18.840 --> 00:39:20.999
and there's a lot of nuance there.

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:24.279
Again, it's about not seeing
each other as enemies.

00:39:24.280 --> 00:39:26.759
You guys are on the same team.

00:39:27.320 --> 00:39:31.799
We put a list of stuff together
just to get the creative juices going,

00:39:31.800 --> 00:39:33.719
and you probably have your own list,

00:39:33.720 --> 00:39:38.519
but you can get color pops
in the photography or illustrations

00:39:38.520 --> 00:39:42.646
or in whatever artwork
and then separate the content.

00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:45.399
How about section dividers?

00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:47.639
Let's say you have your landing section

00:39:47.640 --> 00:39:50.159
and then you're going
into another section below it.

00:39:50.160 --> 00:39:54.679
Just give a nice big color
bar there and some tagline

00:39:54.680 --> 00:39:59.840
or whatever in a bright white
color or something.

00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:01.299
Patterns.

00:40:01.300 --> 00:40:03.839
You see patterns used behind things,

00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:06.599
but you can use them as art treatments.

00:40:06.600 --> 00:40:09.119
Any other graphic treatments like creating

00:40:09.120 --> 00:40:12.849
your photography
to be bitmap or duotone images.

00:40:13.160 --> 00:40:16.119
Again, all of this stuff
is probably predetermined

00:40:16.120 --> 00:40:19.919
by your brand manager
if you are a bigger brand,

00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:23.479
but if you're just mom-and-pop
boutique thing,

00:40:23.480 --> 00:40:27.119
it's up to us to come
up with these solutions.

00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:32.832
On the accessibility professional side,
you've got a couple to share too.

00:40:32.940 --> 00:40:35.219
Deneb, you want to jump in here?

00:40:35.220 --> 00:40:38.119
Deneb: Yes, and I'm actually
not going to share these.

00:40:38.120 --> 00:40:41.880
We've got unsubstantial text decoration.

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:44.199
If you want to add something to the text,

00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:47.719
like a squiggle or a checkmark
or something, that's fantastic.

00:40:47.720 --> 00:40:50.759
Focus indicator,
we're going to skip all of this.

00:40:50.760 --> 00:40:56.680
We do actually have a link to a blog post
that I did on our blog.

00:40:57.800 --> 00:41:02.640
You can go there and I have illustrations
of all those things.

00:41:03.240 --> 00:41:08.720
At the end of the day,
what are our takeaways, Mark?

00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:15.839
Mark: I think if we remind ourselves
where we came from, we are not enemies.

00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:17.679
We are not on different teams.

00:41:17.680 --> 00:41:20.325
We are a part of the same teams,

00:41:20.760 --> 00:41:24.199
but we've got different core
values and we've got to bring

00:41:24.200 --> 00:41:29.119
those values together
and be a team and see the bigger picture.

00:41:29.160 --> 00:41:32.879
I'm for sure guilty of this when we first
started working together,

00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:35.029
of being very silo-driven.

00:41:35.880 --> 00:41:39.240
Number one, present the data.

00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:42.493
It's out there and it tells

00:41:42.494 --> 00:41:45.079
a story of people
who are being overlooked.

00:41:45.080 --> 00:41:51.240
Number two, realize that accessible
design, it doesn't have to suck.

00:41:51.600 --> 00:41:53.199
Go to Apple, go to Microsoft.

00:41:53.200 --> 00:41:55.018
They're doing it well.

00:41:55.920 --> 00:41:57.920
It doesn't have to suck.

00:41:59.040 --> 00:42:00.599
That's what I care about as a designer.

00:42:00.600 --> 00:42:02.599
I don't want it to suck.

00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:06.639
Number three,
keep the content color fully accessible

00:42:06.640 --> 00:42:09.439
and separate it if you need to.

00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:13.407
I think those are the three takeaways
for you guys.

00:42:14.640 --> 00:42:15.719
Deneb: That's really it.

00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:19.559
Then our goal in this presentation
is this very last slide.

00:42:19.560 --> 00:42:22.799
Let's bring branding,
which has been in its own sphere,

00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:24.879
and accessibility,
which has been in its own sphere.

00:42:24.880 --> 00:42:27.959
Let's bring them together,
have them overlap,

00:42:27.960 --> 00:42:31.559
not branding versus accessibility,
not any of that.

00:42:31.560 --> 00:42:33.999
Let's have it together,
branding and accessibility,

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:35.639
and let's set the world on fire.

00:42:35.640 --> 00:42:38.399
Let's all become accessible firebrands

00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:44.359
so that we can get this information
out to our brand managers and really see

00:42:44.360 --> 00:42:46.999
a lot more accessible
design in the future.

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:49.199
Thank you very much for your time.

00:42:49.200 --> 00:42:53.479
We've got our contact
information on our last slide there.

00:42:53.480 --> 00:42:58.919
If you have questions that we don't get
to right now, certainly ask away.

00:42:58.920 --> 00:43:03.119
Mark: Thank you, guys,
and then we'll hand it over.

00:43:03.120 --> 00:43:05.159
Marina: Yes, thank you both so much.

00:43:05.160 --> 00:43:09.524
The chat has been alive
during your entire presentation.

00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:13.840
We do have some questions here.

00:43:14.520 --> 00:43:17.959
Some of these, I think
a couple of them have been answered,

00:43:17.960 --> 00:43:21.134
but I don't think it hurts to reiterate.

00:43:21.400 --> 00:43:25.177
Anonymous says,
"I heard but want to have clarification.

00:43:25.178 --> 00:43:28.919
Are logos not something
that accessibility rules apply?

00:43:28.920 --> 00:43:31.319
It is a big conversation right now."

00:43:31.320 --> 00:43:32.999
Deneb: It is a big conversation.

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:34.839
The official guideline according to WCAG

00:43:34.840 --> 00:43:40.280
2.2 is that logos themselves

00:43:40.580 --> 00:43:44.300
and the brand, the text of that logo

00:43:44.340 --> 00:43:49.859
does not have to meet
the 4.5:1 contrast ratio.

00:43:49.860 --> 00:43:52.919
However, any place else
on the page and the content

00:43:52.920 --> 00:43:53.999
of the page that you're going to use

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:56.879
those colors,
the color needs to be accessible.

00:43:56.880 --> 00:44:02.059
You just have to realize,
"I can't use this logo color

00:44:02.060 --> 00:44:05.159
if I have it,
if it's not accessible in the text."

00:44:05.160 --> 00:44:11.020
Once again, separate the two spheres
of content and branding, I guess.

00:44:11.740 --> 00:44:13.228
Marina: Got it.

00:44:13.720 --> 00:44:16.799
Then I think you went over this too,
but Denise asks,

00:44:16.800 --> 00:44:18.959
"I get that you can't use
the yellow in content,

00:44:18.960 --> 00:44:21.860
but would it still be as a graphic?"

00:44:24.120 --> 00:44:25.919
Deneb: As a graph, did they say?

00:44:25.920 --> 00:44:26.919
Marina: A graphic.

00:44:26.920 --> 00:44:28.199
Deneb: Oh, as a graphic.

00:44:28.200 --> 00:44:28.899
Yes.

00:44:28.900 --> 00:44:33.239
This is the thing, if you think
back to that Coca-Cola website

00:44:33.240 --> 00:44:38.759
that Mark showed us,
they had a graphic with the cans, I think,

00:44:38.760 --> 00:44:42.580
but behind it was just
all of this brand red.

00:44:43.820 --> 00:44:44.779
Yes.

00:44:44.780 --> 00:44:50.280
Having that brand red there really gets
that brand into the site.

00:44:50.920 --> 00:44:53.069
If their color was yellow,

00:44:53.240 --> 00:44:56.279
the graphic can have as much
yellow as it wants.

00:44:56.280 --> 00:45:00.279
As long as it has all text and stuff
and meets the other standards,

00:45:00.280 --> 00:45:03.295
the graphic can have the brand colors.

00:45:03.400 --> 00:45:06.199
That is a great way
to incorporate it into the site.

00:45:06.200 --> 00:45:08.999
The goal of our presentation
is to show you there are plenty

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:11.759
of places to put
the brand color into the site,

00:45:11.760 --> 00:45:16.919
as long as it's not the content,
which is the text, the paragraph,

00:45:16.920 --> 00:45:21.120
the buttons, the headings, links.

00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:23.788
Marina: Great.

00:45:25.560 --> 00:45:28.679
What is a good color contrast checker

00:45:28.680 --> 00:45:31.339
for five or more colors that you can put

00:45:31.340 --> 00:45:36.299
at least three of a brand's colors
in and find more colors that work?

00:45:36.300 --> 00:45:37.259
[chuckles]

00:45:37.260 --> 00:45:40.354
Deneb: Oh, that's a fantastic question.

00:45:41.160 --> 00:45:44.319
Mark, I'm not sure
if you know anything about that,

00:45:44.320 --> 00:45:47.399
but we do have some links
towards the end of the presentation,

00:45:47.400 --> 00:45:51.560
the appendix,
that have some ways out to the--

00:45:52.240 --> 00:45:54.719
it's past there, Mark, it's this one.

00:45:54.720 --> 00:45:59.520
I think this Adobe one might work
for multiple colors.

00:46:04.360 --> 00:46:05.839
This accessible color palette towards

00:46:05.840 --> 00:46:08.159
the bottom of the list and accessible
color generator,

00:46:08.160 --> 00:46:10.959
those will all deal with multiple colors.

00:46:10.960 --> 00:46:15.959
Try those out and hopefully
one of those will work for your use case.

00:46:15.960 --> 00:46:19.134
Marina: I'm definitely saving those too.

00:46:20.520 --> 00:46:21.720
All right.

00:46:23.080 --> 00:46:27.040
I think this answers the same question.

00:46:28.400 --> 00:46:32.069
How can we know how much our contrast is?

00:46:35.080 --> 00:46:36.399
Deneb: There are several ways.

00:46:36.400 --> 00:46:40.439
I like this first link
on this appendix tools page.

00:46:40.440 --> 00:46:42.599
The WebAIM contrast
checker is my favorite,

00:46:42.600 --> 00:46:47.519
though the Adobe color
accessibility tools are fantastic as well.

00:46:47.520 --> 00:46:49.917
When I'm trying to figure out

00:46:49.960 --> 00:46:53.519
if a color on a webpage
is accessible or not,

00:46:53.520 --> 00:46:56.614
I'm going to go to the Chrome DevTools.

00:46:56.640 --> 00:46:57.879
I actually have a video on that one.

00:46:57.880 --> 00:47:00.599
That's the one, two, three,
four, fifth bullet point.

00:47:00.600 --> 00:47:02.757
No, the fourth bullet point down.

00:47:02.758 --> 00:47:04.439
Oh, I didn't put the video on.

00:47:04.440 --> 00:47:06.759
I'll put that link on in the slideshow.

00:47:06.760 --> 00:47:11.720
If you go there,
it'll show you how to check the ratio.

00:47:11.880 --> 00:47:14.159
Then also Chrome does a really neat thing.

00:47:14.160 --> 00:47:17.651
It gives you a way
to automatically change it

00:47:18.340 --> 00:47:22.600
to find the color that's dark enough
or light enough.

00:47:22.880 --> 00:47:25.239
It's really great. Watch this.

00:47:25.240 --> 00:47:28.079
I'll put that right
after we get off today.

00:47:28.080 --> 00:47:30.159
I'll put the link onto
it there and come back

00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:32.999
to this page and check that how to use it.

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:34.200
It's great.

00:47:35.240 --> 00:47:36.359
Marina: All right.

00:47:36.360 --> 00:47:40.559
Is applying a CSS text-shadow
behind a white text

00:47:40.560 --> 00:47:44.360
an effective way to fix
a poor contrast ratio?

00:47:46.840 --> 00:47:50.559
Mark: We're going to have probably
slightly different answers to this one.

00:47:50.560 --> 00:47:55.680
This definitely goes back
to our core values and training.

00:47:56.480 --> 00:47:58.999
I'll just say five seconds
on this and then Deneb,

00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:01.400
and feel free to jump in.

00:48:01.600 --> 00:48:04.039
This is one of the first things
they tell you in design

00:48:04.040 --> 00:48:07.359
school that you have to be really careful.

00:48:07.360 --> 00:48:09.759
You want text to speak for itself.

00:48:09.760 --> 00:48:13.119
You don't want to put strokes around it.

00:48:13.120 --> 00:48:18.400
You don't want to apply shadows
to it that are not necessary.

00:48:18.640 --> 00:48:21.239
If you have to do that,
then you have not created

00:48:21.240 --> 00:48:25.880
a background good enough
that allows for enough contrast.

00:48:27.920 --> 00:48:31.959
My understanding
is that from the designer standpoint,

00:48:31.960 --> 00:48:36.979
that's not something that we would
be encouraging because it messes

00:48:36.980 --> 00:48:43.639
with more than just the contrast ratio.

00:48:43.640 --> 00:48:46.919
It messes with the aesthetic
and the beauty of it.

00:48:46.920 --> 00:48:50.966
That has its own special
purpose to create a shadow.

00:48:52.200 --> 00:48:53.880
That's my opinion.

00:48:54.480 --> 00:48:58.079
Again, we might have slightly
different opinions and that's okay.

00:48:58.080 --> 00:49:02.920
Deneb: We have actually butted
heads over this a couple times.

00:49:03.120 --> 00:49:06.679
It may not be good from
a design perspective.

00:49:06.680 --> 00:49:08.399
It's not good, as Mark has told us.

00:49:08.400 --> 00:49:12.680
However, from an accessibility
rules perspective,

00:49:13.200 --> 00:49:19.359
it does make it pass the rule.

00:49:19.360 --> 00:49:23.039
I mean, yes, it can be used,
but it's not a good idea.

00:49:23.040 --> 00:49:27.339
Better is to never have text over an image

00:49:27.340 --> 00:49:30.559
that's too light or
too dark to be legible.

00:49:30.560 --> 00:49:34.799
Now, the way that you can check
that one out in this appendix page

00:49:34.800 --> 00:49:39.243
as well is the link on the video
to the Firefox DevTools.

00:49:39.920 --> 00:49:43.559
Firefox is the only place
I've found that actually,

00:49:43.560 --> 00:49:48.240
it has a way to determine
the range of contrast

00:49:48.960 --> 00:49:54.200
ratios of text
over an image or a gradient background.

00:49:54.600 --> 00:49:56.679
That'll show you if you need

00:49:56.680 --> 00:50:01.559
to make the background image
substantially lighter

00:50:01.560 --> 00:50:04.919
so that a dark overlaying text works

00:50:04.920 --> 00:50:07.919
or substantially
darker if a lighter over--

00:50:07.920 --> 00:50:11.839
That's how you can figure out
if you've actually accomplished that.

00:50:11.840 --> 00:50:16.439
Better than that, though,
is just not to have text over an image.

00:50:16.440 --> 00:50:20.279
I think Mark and I have both come
to the agreement.

00:50:20.280 --> 00:50:24.279
He'd rather separate
and not have the text over the image.

00:50:24.280 --> 00:50:28.559
He said that's a good design
choice and he had to put it on top.

00:50:28.560 --> 00:50:30.560
It's better to separate.

00:50:30.640 --> 00:50:32.319
Marina: Thank you both so much.

00:50:32.320 --> 00:50:35.159
That's about
all the time we have for this session.

00:50:35.160 --> 00:50:37.474
