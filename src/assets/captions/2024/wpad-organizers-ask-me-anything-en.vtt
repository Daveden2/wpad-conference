Announcer: WordPress
Accessibility Day 2024.

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:04.986
Ask Me Anything!

00:00:04.986 --> 00:00:06.624
with WordPress Accessibility Day

00:00:06.624 --> 00:00:09.780
organizers and panelists, Ricky Onsman,

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.582
Technical Content
Writer at TPGI,

00:00:12.772 --> 00:00:15.352
Adrienne Grace, Accessibility Analyst

00:00:15.352 --> 00:00:17.468
and Graphic Designer at The Standard,

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:18.728
and Ricky Blacker,

00:00:18.856 --> 00:00:20.486
Senior Partner Account Manager

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:21.886
at WP Engine.

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:23.968
This presentation was recorded

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:25.742
October 2024.

00:00:26.382 --> 00:00:29.012
Kelly Crowley: Welcome to WordPress

00:00:29.012 --> 00:00:31.402
Accessibility Day 2024.

00:00:31.578 --> 00:00:33.098
My name is Kelly Crowley,

00:00:33.098 --> 00:00:35.312
and I'm an accessible design consultant,

00:00:35.336 --> 00:00:36.780
a writer, and a coach.

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.452
I'm also a Paralympian

00:00:38.452 --> 00:00:40.570
and a member of the disability community.

00:00:40.764 --> 00:00:43.314
We've had an unexpected change

00:00:43.314 --> 00:00:44.232
to our schedule.

00:00:44.232 --> 00:00:46.746
Our planned speaker, Tina Reese,

00:00:46.746 --> 00:00:50.200
is unavailable, so we have two members

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.678
of our organizing team

00:00:51.678 --> 00:00:53.832
who have agreed to step in as panelists,

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.234
and they're going to share

00:00:55.252 --> 00:00:57.762
some of their experience with us.

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.828
I'm going to start off by asking

00:01:00.878 --> 00:01:04.070
both of our panelists to go ahead

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:07.514
and introduce themselves, share their role

00:01:07.544 --> 00:01:10.740
in WordPress and accessibility.

00:01:10.928 --> 00:01:13.876
Then ask a few questions,

00:01:13.876 --> 00:01:17.332
and please join in, in the Q&amp;A.

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.960
You can post your questions, please,

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.738
using the Q&amp;A feature.

00:01:21.808 --> 00:01:23.812
If you would like to connect

00:01:23.812 --> 00:01:25.872
with the other participants,

00:01:25.902 --> 00:01:27.678
you can do so in the chat feature.

00:01:28.802 --> 00:01:34.628
All right, so I guess I'll turn it over to Ricky.

00:01:34.628 --> 00:01:36.458
Ricky O, you can go ahead

00:01:36.458 --> 00:01:38.438
and get started with your intro.

00:01:38.658 --> 00:01:41.320
Ricky Blacker: Okay, so this is working.

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:42.618
Hi, everybody.

00:01:42.674 --> 00:01:43.684
Can you hear me okay?

00:01:46.176 --> 00:01:46.666
Yes?

00:01:46.682 --> 00:01:47.102
Good.

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.836
[chuckles]

00:01:49.332 --> 00:01:50.684
Ricky Blacker: I'm actually doing

00:01:50.702 --> 00:01:52.182
the lead tech role today,

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.852
but I've just been brought in, as you can see,

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.144
on this emergency situation

00:01:58.278 --> 00:02:00.810
to be a panelist.

00:02:00.916 --> 00:02:03.134
Myself, and we're going to meet

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:04.398
the other Ricky in a minute,

00:02:04.776 --> 00:02:07.984
I am an ex-website developer

00:02:08.572 --> 00:02:10.914
currently working for WP Engine.

00:02:11.056 --> 00:02:12.980
I've had a lot of experience

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:14.918
with accessibility,

00:02:15.822 --> 00:02:17.336
mainly from doing it wrong

00:02:17.354 --> 00:02:18.280
when I first started learning

00:02:18.306 --> 00:02:19.456
how to do websites.

00:02:19.702 --> 00:02:25.772
I've been very much wanting to see

00:02:25.794 --> 00:02:27.682
accessibility more mainstream

00:02:27.742 --> 00:02:30.014
in website development for a long time.

00:02:30.768 --> 00:02:31.964
That's enough for me.

00:02:32.006 --> 00:02:34.332
I'm going to pass it over to the other Ricky.

00:02:35.162 --> 00:02:36.140
Ricky Onsman: Good day, all.

00:02:36.174 --> 00:02:38.632
I'm Ricky Onsman, also based in Australia.

00:02:39.442 --> 00:02:43.402
My skill set, I guess, is an intersection

00:02:43.452 --> 00:02:45.476
of WordPress and accessibility.

00:02:45.564 --> 00:02:46.496
I'm currently

00:02:46.502 --> 00:02:49.130
the principal technical writer for TPGI,

00:02:49.148 --> 00:02:52.396
a global digital accessibility consultancy.

00:02:52.598 --> 00:02:55.242
My job there is to write the guidance

00:02:55.288 --> 00:02:57.440
that people interpret for how to get

00:02:57.452 --> 00:02:59.782
their clients to make their websites

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.040
conform to WCAG

00:03:01.062 --> 00:03:03.040
and all the other standards that apply.

00:03:03.306 --> 00:03:06.512
In a previous life, I was a freelance

00:03:06.512 --> 00:03:07.960
web designer and developer,

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:10.780
and I worked almost exclusively in WordPress,

00:03:10.804 --> 00:03:12.764
and that dates right back to the early days

00:03:12.764 --> 00:03:14.720
of when WordPress first came out.

00:03:14.814 --> 00:03:17.834
At that stage, most of the web actually

00:03:17.834 --> 00:03:19.666
was quite accessible because everybody

00:03:19.666 --> 00:03:22.354
was designing according to HTML standards.

00:03:22.498 --> 00:03:24.940
It's in the years since that it's become

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:27.364
more difficult and almost a requirement

00:03:27.364 --> 00:03:28.136
to figure out

00:03:28.136 --> 00:03:29.602
how to make websites accessible,

00:03:29.602 --> 00:03:31.368
including WordPress, of course.

00:03:31.562 --> 00:03:32.670
That's one of the things

00:03:32.702 --> 00:03:33.928
that's happened there.

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:35.704
I think like a lot of WordPress designers

00:03:35.704 --> 00:03:36.682
and developers,

00:03:36.714 --> 00:03:39.206
I've had some experience in creating

00:03:39.206 --> 00:03:42.230
my own themes and plugins,

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:43.612
and trying to make them accessible

00:03:43.612 --> 00:03:44.534
along the way.

00:03:44.664 --> 00:03:46.052
That's my background.

00:03:47.698 --> 00:03:49.722
We've been joined by Adrienne.

00:03:51.776 --> 00:03:54.340
Kelly: Adrienne, if you want to go ahead

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:55.728
and just introduce yourself,

00:03:55.728 --> 00:03:57.592
we're giving everyone a sense

00:03:57.592 --> 00:03:58.616
of what your background is.

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:02.464
If you want to go ahead.

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:04.420
Adrienne Grace: My name is Adrienne Grace,

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:07.186
and I am one of the WordPress

00:04:07.186 --> 00:04:10.088
Accessibility Day organizers.

00:04:10.272 --> 00:04:13.242
I am a graphic designer

00:04:13.242 --> 00:04:14.590
and accessibility analyst,

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:17.316
and I also do some web design

00:04:17.316 --> 00:04:19.060
and front-end web development.

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:21.966
Kelly: Great.

00:04:22.352 --> 00:04:25.370
All right, so I guess all of us learn

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:27.926
by doing things wrong and then figuring out

00:04:27.926 --> 00:04:29.158
how to do them right,

00:04:29.198 --> 00:04:30.924
so I'm wondering if we could go around

00:04:30.924 --> 00:04:34.772
and each of you maybe just say something,

00:04:34.772 --> 00:04:38.584
like what was one of the most impactful things

00:04:38.584 --> 00:04:40.224
that you realized early on

00:04:40.272 --> 00:04:41.902
in your accessibility journey,

00:04:41.948 --> 00:04:43.724
"Oh, my gosh, I've been doing this wrong"

00:04:43.808 --> 00:04:45.920
that has made a huge difference

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:47.726
that you carry with you today?

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:51.706
We'll go ahead and maybe start with Ricky

00:04:51.758 --> 00:04:53.600
who started the intros.

00:04:57.986 --> 00:04:59.612
Ricky Blacker: Let me take myself off mute.

00:04:59.612 --> 00:05:00.970
[laughs]

00:05:01.066 --> 00:05:02.794
I've got to get the coffee cup that says that--

00:05:03.484 --> 00:05:05.898
Not sure if anyone can see me, just checking.

00:05:05.898 --> 00:05:07.278
This is--

00:05:07.278 --> 00:05:08.502
Oh, here we go. There we go.

00:05:08.542 --> 00:05:10.148
I can spotlight myself now.

00:05:11.754 --> 00:05:13.922
Look, honestly, this is probably

00:05:13.922 --> 00:05:15.158
a really easy question to answer.

00:05:18.344 --> 00:05:20.328
When I first started doing web design,

00:05:20.726 --> 00:05:22.710
I had no idea about accessibility

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:24.454
or what I was doing altogether.

00:05:24.454 --> 00:05:27.340
The first big website I'd created,

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:29.470
I thought it was amazing.

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:31.270
Everybody said it looked really great,

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:34.170
and it was running for months,

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:35.218
and then somebody--

00:05:35.218 --> 00:05:36.482
I just happened to be,

00:05:36.482 --> 00:05:38.918
it was for a big online store.

00:05:38.992 --> 00:05:40.320
It was a wholesaler.

00:05:40.544 --> 00:05:42.344
I just happened to be there that day

00:05:42.344 --> 00:05:43.364
when somebody called up

00:05:43.364 --> 00:05:44.680
and they said they couldn't see

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:46.366
any words on the site.

00:05:48.038 --> 00:05:49.814
I looked at the website and I was going,

00:05:49.814 --> 00:05:51.422
"Look, I can see the words."

00:05:51.636 --> 00:05:52.802
This person said, "Look,

00:05:52.802 --> 00:05:54.742
I cannot see any words on the site.

00:05:54.768 --> 00:05:56.060
It's just all black."

00:05:56.754 --> 00:05:59.042
That's when I learned about contrast.

00:05:59.472 --> 00:06:02.162
When you have dark blue writing,

00:06:02.214 --> 00:06:03.012
or you have blue writing

00:06:03.012 --> 00:06:04.284
on a black background,

00:06:04.312 --> 00:06:05.672
looks amazing to me,

00:06:05.672 --> 00:06:07.388
but for somebody with colorblindness,

00:06:07.614 --> 00:06:08.490
not so good.

00:06:08.576 --> 00:06:13.096
That was my first wake-up call, I guess,

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:16.224
on what it means for a site to be accessible.

00:06:16.388 --> 00:06:19.644
From there on, I really had to think about

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:21.828
everything I did to make sure

00:06:21.828 --> 00:06:23.820
that everybody had accessibility

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:25.490
to the websites that I've built.

00:06:25.814 --> 00:06:28.306
That's one of the things that I've carried

00:06:28.306 --> 00:06:29.828
with me for a long time.

00:06:29.828 --> 00:06:33.734
It is a huge topic and it's something

00:06:33.744 --> 00:06:35.880
that we need to think about more,

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:37.234
but that was the thing that started me

00:06:37.234 --> 00:06:38.254
on this journey.

00:06:44.106 --> 00:06:46.714
Ricky Onsman: For me, I would say

00:06:47.246 --> 00:06:49.280
the crunch point for me,

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:51.674
particularly in working with WordPress,

00:06:51.768 --> 00:06:53.518
was assumptions.

00:06:53.906 --> 00:06:55.916
Once I started working with WordPress,

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:57.990
I assumed that themes and plugins

00:06:57.990 --> 00:06:59.944
would be accessible by default.

00:07:00.802 --> 00:07:03.510
It was a bit of a shock to me to realize

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:04.872
that actually people didn't pay

00:07:04.872 --> 00:07:06.886
that much attention to accessibility at all,

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:11.260
and that most of the themes were worse

00:07:11.306 --> 00:07:14.598
than some static websites

00:07:14.606 --> 00:07:16.468
in terms of their accessibility.

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:21.304
I still use themes,

00:07:21.304 --> 00:07:22.876
and I've actually preferred

00:07:22.876 --> 00:07:24.932
some of the free themes that are around

00:07:24.932 --> 00:07:27.646
because they are a bit like a blank canvas

00:07:27.646 --> 00:07:29.868
that I can work with, so I can impose

00:07:29.868 --> 00:07:33.954
my design and functionality on a site

00:07:34.058 --> 00:07:35.906
using a theme like Astra.

00:07:35.978 --> 00:07:37.766
I used to use Canvas a lot.

00:07:38.046 --> 00:07:40.948
That's been kind of what has made

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:43.196
WordPress design work for me

00:07:43.196 --> 00:07:45.614
in terms of accessibility, finding themes

00:07:45.614 --> 00:07:47.544
and plugins that will allow me

00:07:47.544 --> 00:07:49.270
to add accessibility.

00:07:49.366 --> 00:07:51.552
That was a real turning point for me

00:07:51.552 --> 00:07:53.524
when I realized not only could I do that,

00:07:53.536 --> 00:07:54.752
but I would have to do that

00:07:54.792 --> 00:07:56.752
if I wanted my websites to be accessible.

00:07:58.490 --> 00:08:02.420
Kelly: A really important lesson,

00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:03.670
that accessibility doesn't happen

00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:04.822
by accident, right?

00:08:04.822 --> 00:08:06.020
It's intentional.

00:08:06.108 --> 00:08:10.024
Adrienne, what's one of your first lessons

00:08:10.024 --> 00:08:11.434
in your accessibility journey

00:08:11.434 --> 00:08:12.952
that you still carry with you today?

00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:15.204
I'm sure there's a lot, but maybe one of the most--

00:08:15.226 --> 00:08:16.376
Adrienne: [laughs]

00:08:16.488 --> 00:08:18.058
Yes, actually,

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:19.908
because I originally started out

00:08:19.908 --> 00:08:22.574
as a graphic designer and got into web design,

00:08:22.636 --> 00:08:26.828
and I knew about alt text and that,

00:08:26.868 --> 00:08:29.926
although I admit that I look back and think,

00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:32.616
what I wrote, now that I know more,

00:08:32.638 --> 00:08:34.604
was not acceptable.

00:08:37.390 --> 00:08:39.422
Once somebody mentioned color contrast,

00:08:39.452 --> 00:08:41.556
and I started doing some research about it,

00:08:41.556 --> 00:08:45.170
and I had been given actually designs

00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:46.110
by somebody else,

00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:47.652
and I had to go to them and say,

00:08:47.666 --> 00:08:50.216
"Hey, look, I think this is a problem.

00:08:51.574 --> 00:08:54.560
This is not going to meet color contrast at all."

00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:59.000
As many of you know, if you're on a phone,

00:08:59.028 --> 00:09:01.488
you're in a bright light, you really can't see.

00:09:01.502 --> 00:09:04.606
Once I started hearing about,

00:09:04.702 --> 00:09:06.220
"Hey, there's these other things

00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:07.720
other than just alt text,"

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:09.690
I honestly thought that's all it was.

00:09:09.964 --> 00:09:14.354
Like everybody, the more you look back

00:09:14.354 --> 00:09:16.586
and think, "How could I not have known?"

00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:19.678
You just want to go and continue

00:09:19.714 --> 00:09:21.162
your journey to make it better.

00:09:21.712 --> 00:09:23.566
I'm sure in a year I'll look back

00:09:23.566 --> 00:09:25.048
and still say the same thing,

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:26.616
"Look what I didn't know."

00:09:27.982 --> 00:09:28.600
Kelly: Great.

00:09:28.618 --> 00:09:30.422
Hopefully, we're all on a learning journey here,

00:09:30.422 --> 00:09:31.220
definitely.

00:09:31.266 --> 00:09:32.314
I know I am.

00:09:33.072 --> 00:09:35.134
Here's a question, I'm not sure who would be

00:09:35.134 --> 00:09:36.202
the best to answer it,

00:09:36.202 --> 00:09:38.208
so I'll just let one of you jump in

00:09:38.208 --> 00:09:40.322
and take the lead on this.

00:09:40.366 --> 00:09:43.542
How do you assess WordPress plugins

00:09:43.542 --> 00:09:46.098
or themes for accessibility to know

00:09:46.098 --> 00:09:47.752
if they provide a good starting point,

00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:50.792
or won't add a lot of issues to your site?

00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:55.474
Ricky Onsman: Sorry.

00:09:55.498 --> 00:09:56.732
Could you just say that again?

00:09:56.732 --> 00:09:58.156
I didn't quite catch it.

00:09:59.592 --> 00:10:01.028
Kelly: The question is,

00:10:01.088 --> 00:10:04.060
how do you assess WordPress plugins

00:10:04.096 --> 00:10:07.280
or themes for accessibility to know

00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:09.190
if they provide a good starting point

00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:13.624
or won't add accessibility issues

00:10:13.624 --> 00:10:14.562
to your site?

00:10:14.902 --> 00:10:15.770
Ricky Onsman: Right.

00:10:15.822 --> 00:10:18.358
I don't have a sophisticated answer for this.

00:10:18.434 --> 00:10:21.954
I'm afraid what I do is I try it and try a plugin,

00:10:21.954 --> 00:10:24.484
and then I run my accessibility tests,

00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:26.484
and then I discover that it's creating

00:10:26.484 --> 00:10:27.690
all kinds of problems,

00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:28.656
so I'll get rid of that one

00:10:28.662 --> 00:10:29.734
and try another one.

00:10:30.014 --> 00:10:31.688
That's about as sophisticated

00:10:31.688 --> 00:10:33.232
as my methodology gets.

00:10:36.364 --> 00:10:38.890
Adrienne: I know that if I find a theme

00:10:38.890 --> 00:10:41.854
that has an example site,

00:10:42.076 --> 00:10:43.412
I will run some tests

00:10:43.412 --> 00:10:44.994
on the example site first.

00:10:45.834 --> 00:10:48.192
Sometimes, they'll have a demo,

00:10:48.342 --> 00:10:50.024
and that's a really good way

00:10:50.024 --> 00:10:52.324
to kind of poke around a little bit

00:10:52.324 --> 00:10:54.104
without having to make the investment

00:10:54.244 --> 00:10:56.368
of actually importing it and trying to set it up

00:10:56.368 --> 00:10:58.846
and everything with the client's content.

00:10:59.594 --> 00:11:00.718
Maybe that's cheating.

00:11:02.956 --> 00:11:04.198
Ricky Blacker: I think, for me, it's--

00:11:04.212 --> 00:11:06.566
Am I on mute?

00:11:08.416 --> 00:11:09.246
Kelly: We can hear you.

00:11:09.246 --> 00:11:10.524
[laughter]

00:11:10.546 --> 00:11:11.308
Ricky Blacker: Just double-checking.

00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:11.774
Ricky Onsman: You're good.

00:11:11.786 --> 00:11:13.146
Ricky Blacker: So used to being on mute.

00:11:14.094 --> 00:11:15.974
Look, for me, and one of the things I found

00:11:15.974 --> 00:11:18.318
when I first started doing website design

00:11:18.318 --> 00:11:19.916
was I was always looking

00:11:19.916 --> 00:11:21.082
for different themes

00:11:21.082 --> 00:11:23.012
to fit the project or the client

00:11:23.012 --> 00:11:24.328
that I was working on.

00:11:24.374 --> 00:11:26.700
What I found when I was doing that

00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:28.720
is I'd end up with a whole heap of themes

00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:30.720
that were all different in the way

00:11:30.770 --> 00:11:32.572
you had to interact with them

00:11:32.582 --> 00:11:33.428
and do things with them,

00:11:33.428 --> 00:11:34.348
and it got confusing,

00:11:34.348 --> 00:11:36.070
especially if you had a site

00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:36.762
that you didn't have

00:11:36.762 --> 00:11:38.816
to touch for quite a long time.

00:11:39.072 --> 00:11:40.672
I got into the habit

00:11:40.672 --> 00:11:42.580
of picking one or two themes.

00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:43.948
Generally, you want one thing

00:11:43.948 --> 00:11:45.318
that you get to know really well.

00:11:45.318 --> 00:11:46.786
Choosing the right theme,

00:11:46.786 --> 00:11:48.394
obviously something very lightweight,

00:11:48.622 --> 00:11:51.814
very easy to make look

00:11:51.814 --> 00:11:53.040
the way you want it to look,

00:11:53.132 --> 00:11:55.892
but also have as much accessibility,

00:11:56.208 --> 00:11:58.312
pro-accessibility features built-in

00:11:58.474 --> 00:11:59.616
right from the very start.

00:11:59.616 --> 00:12:00.882
Learn that deeply.

00:12:00.898 --> 00:12:04.590
Use CSS and code to change the appearance

00:12:04.590 --> 00:12:07.380
of that theme as much as you can

00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:10.694
and make it fit the clients or the project

00:12:10.694 --> 00:12:13.120
or whatever you're doing within the web space.

00:12:13.484 --> 00:12:15.674
If you're just one person

00:12:15.674 --> 00:12:17.376
doing one website for your business,

00:12:17.376 --> 00:12:18.604
that's not as important,

00:12:18.604 --> 00:12:20.742
but if you're an agency or a developer

00:12:20.742 --> 00:12:21.888
where you're working

00:12:21.888 --> 00:12:24.130
with multiple clients all the time,

00:12:24.176 --> 00:12:25.310
finding the right one,

00:12:25.310 --> 00:12:27.708
sticking to it until obviously

00:12:27.708 --> 00:12:28.668
something better

00:12:28.668 --> 00:12:30.596
maybe down the track comes along.

00:12:30.612 --> 00:12:33.370
I found finding one good theme,

00:12:33.974 --> 00:12:36.094
making sure it's working correctly,

00:12:36.094 --> 00:12:37.866
lightweight, stick with it,

00:12:37.892 --> 00:12:39.076
get to know it really well

00:12:39.076 --> 00:12:40.950
because the more you get to know one theme,

00:12:41.066 --> 00:12:43.074
the better you'll be at it and the more you--

00:12:43.074 --> 00:12:45.294
Plus, you can build in a lot of these

00:12:45.294 --> 00:12:47.862
accessibility features that you need

00:12:47.862 --> 00:12:50.166
and replicate that across multiple sites

00:12:50.166 --> 00:12:51.962
as you build out for customers.

00:12:54.582 --> 00:12:55.220
Kelly: All right,

00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:57.406
so we have a question in the Q&amp;A.

00:12:57.566 --> 00:13:01.802
It says, is there input on accessibility

00:13:01.832 --> 00:13:05.918
for default theme or patterns for WordPress,

00:13:06.158 --> 00:13:08.392
specifically the color combos

00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:12.846
seem to not be tested/don't pass accessibility?

00:13:18.364 --> 00:13:19.806
I'm not sure what to make of that,

00:13:20.116 --> 00:13:21.020
to be honest,

00:13:23.858 --> 00:13:26.000
so I'm not sure how to direct the question to.

00:13:26.076 --> 00:13:28.300
If one of you has a good answer

00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:30.156
or a lead on it,

00:13:30.486 --> 00:13:32.156
I think the question is related--

00:13:32.828 --> 00:13:33.488
Go ahead.

00:13:33.512 --> 00:13:35.150
Adrienne: Is it about the design?

00:13:35.150 --> 00:13:39.922
I'm trying to read the question again so that--

00:13:40.422 --> 00:13:40.976
Kelly: Yes.

00:13:40.976 --> 00:13:42.544
Ricky Onsman: We're talking about

00:13:42.556 --> 00:13:45.984
the default themes like WordPress 2021, 2022,

00:13:45.984 --> 00:13:47.110
that sort of stuff.

00:13:47.276 --> 00:13:49.734
I find them incredibly disappointing,

00:13:49.978 --> 00:13:52.216
and they don't seem to get better.

00:13:52.618 --> 00:13:56.604
I find it amazing that a default theme

00:13:56.626 --> 00:13:59.988
can be offered that is often increasingly

00:14:00.366 --> 00:14:02.864
less accessible year by year.

00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:06.012
They have funky little things thrown in that,

00:14:07.556 --> 00:14:11.476
I guess, fit in with current trends,

00:14:11.776 --> 00:14:13.760
but they don't advance

00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:16.188
or enhance accessibility as far as I can see.

00:14:16.188 --> 00:14:18.964
I very rarely do more than glance

00:14:18.964 --> 00:14:20.686
at a default theme these days,

00:14:20.686 --> 00:14:22.424
I just look for something that works better

00:14:22.424 --> 00:14:23.874
almost from the start.

00:14:26.616 --> 00:14:28.834
Adrienne: It is surprising to see

00:14:28.834 --> 00:14:30.826
some of the color themes that are built in.

00:14:30.918 --> 00:14:32.400
Some of them, I do think that,

00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:35.448
the 2024 theme, they did work very hard

00:14:35.448 --> 00:14:37.808
to make some accessible

00:14:37.808 --> 00:14:39.194
color themes in there,

00:14:40.182 --> 00:14:43.118
but part of that is also knowing

00:14:43.118 --> 00:14:44.520
how to combine those colors.

00:14:44.618 --> 00:14:46.410
You can still take a dark color

00:14:46.410 --> 00:14:48.164
and if you pair it with a dark color

00:14:49.048 --> 00:14:50.160
and there isn't--

00:14:50.318 --> 00:14:52.212
You need that color,

00:14:52.212 --> 00:14:53.828
that grid that you can create

00:14:53.828 --> 00:14:55.420
so that you know what you can use

00:14:55.420 --> 00:14:58.220
and what combos you can use together.

00:14:59.008 --> 00:15:02.300
Does it need to be that 4.5 to 1,

00:15:02.344 --> 00:15:06.238
or is it a UX element where maybe

00:15:06.238 --> 00:15:07.756
it could be 3 to 1?

00:15:08.876 --> 00:15:09.914
Kelly: Adrienne, would you--

00:15:11.236 --> 00:15:12.580
I'm sorry, say that again.

00:15:12.998 --> 00:15:13.824
Kelly: Go ahead.

00:15:13.872 --> 00:15:15.234
I was going to say, would you be willing

00:15:15.234 --> 00:15:16.704
to say more about your process

00:15:16.704 --> 00:15:19.666
for evaluating your color palette

00:15:19.666 --> 00:15:23.768
and deciding how you are going

00:15:23.778 --> 00:15:26.152
to make it work?

00:15:26.826 --> 00:15:28.982
Adrienne: I actually, when I can,

00:15:28.982 --> 00:15:32.546
I sit down with the client's color palette

00:15:32.598 --> 00:15:34.102
and I do that--

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:35.032
What is it?

00:15:35.032 --> 00:15:36.568
The eight contrast grid,

00:15:36.568 --> 00:15:38.282
the eight shapes contrast grid,

00:15:38.384 --> 00:15:39.470
because I want to know,

00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:41.472
and I want to be able to point to something

00:15:41.590 --> 00:15:44.696
when we start building out a design

00:15:44.696 --> 00:15:45.864
of when we do a mock-up,

00:15:45.864 --> 00:15:47.556
when we do a wireframe and say,

00:15:47.744 --> 00:15:50.026
"This is what we can do, and this is what we can't."

00:15:50.026 --> 00:15:51.768
Because they may say, well,

00:15:51.768 --> 00:15:53.868
I really like the dark purple

00:15:53.868 --> 00:15:56.402
and the dark blue and that's great,

00:15:56.728 --> 00:15:58.158
but not if you're going to use

00:15:58.158 --> 00:15:59.410
one on top of the other,

00:15:59.432 --> 00:16:01.644
or you need to be able to tell something

00:16:01.676 --> 00:16:03.320
one from the other.

00:16:03.338 --> 00:16:05.630
I can't use those two next to each other

00:16:05.630 --> 00:16:06.992
in a pie chart either.

00:16:07.066 --> 00:16:08.840
They would just blend together.

00:16:09.374 --> 00:16:12.032
There's a little bit about that planning.

00:16:12.032 --> 00:16:14.338
I know in many cases,

00:16:14.338 --> 00:16:19.212
over the course of this Zoom webinars today,

00:16:19.402 --> 00:16:25.198
we've talked about how you can really avoid

00:16:25.208 --> 00:16:27.592
so many problems by starting

00:16:27.592 --> 00:16:29.278
with the design and starting,

00:16:29.312 --> 00:16:30.326
from the beginning,

00:16:30.364 --> 00:16:31.786
thinking about accessibility.

00:16:31.812 --> 00:16:33.802
Color is just one of those ways.

00:16:33.984 --> 00:16:36.516
It is working with that client

00:16:36.516 --> 00:16:38.054
and educating them about,

00:16:38.162 --> 00:16:41.136
"Hey, this is why we need to think about this

00:16:41.146 --> 00:16:42.030
from the beginning."

00:16:42.042 --> 00:16:43.796
Rather than tease them with something

00:16:43.796 --> 00:16:46.572
that they approve, and then you say,

00:16:46.572 --> 00:16:48.344
"No. Oh, now that we're testing it,

00:16:48.344 --> 00:16:49.576
now we can't do that."

00:16:50.888 --> 00:16:52.286
Kelly: Saves resources.

00:16:52.286 --> 00:16:53.838
Ricky Onsman: I think there are some very good tools

00:16:53.838 --> 00:16:55.884
out there too that allow you to start

00:16:55.912 --> 00:16:58.770
with a very basic color combination,

00:16:58.826 --> 00:17:01.698
and that can, A, tell you whether

00:17:01.698 --> 00:17:03.626
that is an accessible color combination

00:17:03.626 --> 00:17:04.320
or not,

00:17:04.332 --> 00:17:06.636
and then B, can it help you adjust

00:17:06.636 --> 00:17:07.778
those color combinations

00:17:07.778 --> 00:17:09.354
so that they are accessible.

00:17:09.406 --> 00:17:10.974
It's great to see that

00:17:10.974 --> 00:17:12.152
there are more and more tools

00:17:12.152 --> 00:17:13.056
like that out there.

00:17:13.056 --> 00:17:15.950
That extends right to the gamut

00:17:15.950 --> 00:17:17.464
of a design system.

00:17:17.522 --> 00:17:19.468
There are design systems there

00:17:19.468 --> 00:17:21.758
now that you can inject

00:17:21.802 --> 00:17:23.930
a color combination into,

00:17:24.046 --> 00:17:26.722
and it will redraw the whole design system

00:17:26.732 --> 00:17:27.770
for you along with

00:17:27.842 --> 00:17:29.730
an accessible color combination,

00:17:29.774 --> 00:17:33.036
so it's horses for courses.

00:17:33.036 --> 00:17:34.906
You got to look for the people

00:17:34.906 --> 00:17:37.122
who create the tools that you can use

00:17:37.186 --> 00:17:39.122
to make that part of your job easier.

00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:43.508
Kelly: There's a suggestion in the chat

00:17:43.526 --> 00:17:45.312
about putting smiley faces

00:17:45.312 --> 00:17:49.782
and frowny faces alongside the grid color

00:17:49.782 --> 00:17:53.454
contrast chart for a [chuckles] quick glance.

00:17:53.454 --> 00:17:54.458
Adrienne: That's a good idea.

00:17:56.370 --> 00:17:57.754
That's clever.

00:17:58.326 --> 00:18:00.590
Kelly: A follow-up question on color is,

00:18:00.602 --> 00:18:03.340
is there a best practice color scheme

00:18:03.432 --> 00:18:06.124
that works across most use cases?

00:18:12.156 --> 00:18:14.204
Adrienne: Other than black and white,

00:18:15.098 --> 00:18:16.340
but that doesn't--

00:18:16.476 --> 00:18:18.440
Even that, then for some people,

00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:20.686
that's too harsh.

00:18:22.470 --> 00:18:24.686
No, I really don't think that

00:18:24.686 --> 00:18:27.390
you should feel limited in color.

00:18:27.530 --> 00:18:31.060
I know Colleen Gratzer always says

00:18:31.114 --> 00:18:34.900
there is no such thing as an inaccessible color,

00:18:34.988 --> 00:18:36.594
there's only inaccessible

00:18:36.654 --> 00:18:38.274
color combinations.

00:18:38.488 --> 00:18:40.286
You're not going to use all pastels

00:18:40.286 --> 00:18:41.478
next to each other.

00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:42.864
You're not going to use

00:18:42.906 --> 00:18:44.438
all the darks next to each other.

00:18:44.438 --> 00:18:47.468
You can absolutely use any of those colors.

00:18:47.536 --> 00:18:48.822
You just need to be careful

00:18:48.822 --> 00:18:50.346
about how you're pairing them,

00:18:50.366 --> 00:18:52.066
what your foreground

00:18:52.066 --> 00:18:53.536
and background colors are,

00:18:53.610 --> 00:18:55.504
and just make those choices from there.

00:18:55.584 --> 00:18:57.666
Don't feel limited.

00:18:58.298 --> 00:19:00.626
If you want to develop for yourself

00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:03.926
a default palette that works for you,

00:19:03.952 --> 00:19:07.196
that you can mock up something very quickly

00:19:07.214 --> 00:19:09.612
to show a client, absolutely,

00:19:09.632 --> 00:19:10.806
build something like that.

00:19:10.832 --> 00:19:14.422
I know you can save it in any way you want.

00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:17.988
Gosh, I think you can put it into the--

00:19:18.254 --> 00:19:20.256
I'm forgetting my backend terms,

00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:20.960
but anyway,

00:19:20.966 --> 00:19:23.668
you can create your theme file basically

00:19:23.690 --> 00:19:24.504
and drop it in

00:19:24.504 --> 00:19:25.968
if that's what you really want to do.

00:19:26.858 --> 00:19:28.640
Ricky Onsman: One of the talks earlier today

00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:31.260
talked about logos and color combinations,

00:19:31.362 --> 00:19:33.902
and personally, I quite enjoy that challenge

00:19:33.990 --> 00:19:37.094
of getting a client who has a set of colors

00:19:37.094 --> 00:19:38.940
that they want to use as their brand,

00:19:39.268 --> 00:19:41.450
and then finding a way to make

00:19:41.450 --> 00:19:43.012
those color combinations work

00:19:43.012 --> 00:19:44.424
in an accessible way.

00:19:44.466 --> 00:19:47.010
Often it is, it's a fight,

00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:48.790
and you have to really put up

00:19:48.790 --> 00:19:49.820
arguments to say,

00:19:49.834 --> 00:19:52.460
"Well, what's worth more to you,

00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:54.788
your brand color or making your website

00:19:54.788 --> 00:19:56.334
accessible to as many possible

00:19:56.334 --> 00:19:58.100
potential customers as possible?"

00:19:59.150 --> 00:20:00.680
It's a good challenge

00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:02.256
because in almost all cases,

00:20:02.256 --> 00:20:04.206
it can be done. It's just a matter

00:20:04.206 --> 00:20:05.286
of how you do it.

00:20:06.572 --> 00:20:07.956
Ricky Blacker: I think one of the biggest

00:20:07.956 --> 00:20:11.930
challenges I faced was when you want to put

00:20:11.946 --> 00:20:14.376
text with an image background

00:20:14.502 --> 00:20:16.378
and how to do that successfully,

00:20:17.402 --> 00:20:19.386
because putting words

00:20:19.386 --> 00:20:21.988
on a solid background is very easy

00:20:21.988 --> 00:20:23.186
to get the contrast right.

00:20:23.186 --> 00:20:25.230
When you've got that time where you want

00:20:25.230 --> 00:20:25.728
to have a nice

00:20:25.728 --> 00:20:28.832
mountain scenery background picture,

00:20:28.832 --> 00:20:30.346
but you want to put some words over the top

00:20:30.346 --> 00:20:32.822
and finding ways to make it look amazing

00:20:32.836 --> 00:20:35.510
and stand out so you can read the words.

00:20:35.538 --> 00:20:36.876
That was one of the things

00:20:36.902 --> 00:20:38.638
that I always struggled with.

00:20:39.716 --> 00:20:41.776
Sometimes, you have to make sacrifices

00:20:41.776 --> 00:20:43.914
in what you wanted it to look like

00:20:43.914 --> 00:20:46.182
to what was actually accessible

00:20:46.294 --> 00:20:47.572
for people to read.

00:20:50.544 --> 00:20:52.976
Adrienne: In the chat, Meg Miller says,

00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:55.292
"I love creating palettes

00:20:55.292 --> 00:20:58.804
using the Tailwind Ink HCL generator."

00:20:59.578 --> 00:21:00.854
I was just about to type,

00:21:00.854 --> 00:21:02.462
"That is beyond my skill set,

00:21:02.462 --> 00:21:04.406
but it sounds like a very cool tool."

00:21:08.834 --> 00:21:09.818
Kelly: All right.

00:21:09.952 --> 00:21:15.744
Let's talk curb cuts, so in the physical world,

00:21:15.788 --> 00:21:17.694
we think about curb cuts

00:21:17.694 --> 00:21:20.816
as they're an accessibility feature,

00:21:20.816 --> 00:21:22.574
but that benefit everyone.

00:21:25.882 --> 00:21:27.122
Maybe we could go around

00:21:27.122 --> 00:21:29.362
and everyone maybe mention

00:21:29.394 --> 00:21:30.756
one or two of your--

00:21:30.812 --> 00:21:33.006
What you think of as digital curb cuts,

00:21:33.036 --> 00:21:34.972
things that we do for accessibility

00:21:34.986 --> 00:21:36.760
that are actually just making the web

00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:37.842
a better place.

00:21:39.958 --> 00:21:40.926
Ricky Onsman: Well, I'll speak up

00:21:40.926 --> 00:21:42.454
in favor of captions.

00:21:42.782 --> 00:21:45.372
Captions on videos, absolute godsend

00:21:45.372 --> 00:21:46.698
to so many people.

00:21:46.774 --> 00:21:49.598
It's a simple thing.

00:21:50.062 --> 00:21:51.984
In Australia, it started with

00:21:51.984 --> 00:21:55.512
a television broadcast called SBS

00:21:55.548 --> 00:21:57.296
that was designed

00:21:57.296 --> 00:21:58.800
as a multicultural broadcaster,

00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:00.354
so they were showing

00:22:00.354 --> 00:22:03.142
a lot of foreign language films and TV series.

00:22:03.398 --> 00:22:06.626
They got very, very low viewership

00:22:06.626 --> 00:22:09.062
until they started putting subtitles

00:22:09.108 --> 00:22:10.864
and then captions on their movies

00:22:10.864 --> 00:22:13.358
and TV series, and then suddenly,

00:22:13.358 --> 00:22:15.396
they became one of the major broadcasters

00:22:15.396 --> 00:22:16.306
in Australia.

00:22:16.398 --> 00:22:19.202
I think, in our country at least,

00:22:19.202 --> 00:22:21.130
that was a big trendsetter,

00:22:21.130 --> 00:22:23.114
and people realized there are a lot of people

00:22:23.114 --> 00:22:25.654
watching these movies who don't even speak

00:22:25.654 --> 00:22:26.948
the language that the movie is in,

00:22:26.948 --> 00:22:28.460
but they enjoy watching the movie

00:22:28.528 --> 00:22:30.572
and that just extends to people

00:22:30.572 --> 00:22:33.020
who can't hear the dialogue at all.

00:22:34.444 --> 00:22:37.530
I have a hearing impairment myself.

00:22:37.556 --> 00:22:40.274
I have captions on for everything I watch,

00:22:40.766 --> 00:22:43.562
and it is an absolute godsend.

00:22:45.768 --> 00:22:46.814
Adrienne: I live with somebody

00:22:46.814 --> 00:22:48.068
that has some hearing loss,

00:22:48.098 --> 00:22:50.480
and it's very normal to me,

00:22:50.550 --> 00:22:53.102
and I would say it's also a godsend

00:22:53.132 --> 00:22:55.036
because otherwise, it would be so loud,

00:22:55.036 --> 00:22:57.462
it would be very uncomfortable for me.

00:22:58.432 --> 00:23:01.358
I also realize how much more you retain.

00:23:01.390 --> 00:23:03.030
[laughs]

00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:07.338
It's really easy switch to go to foreign films.

00:23:13.774 --> 00:23:15.670
I think that's a huge one.

00:23:15.838 --> 00:23:21.074
Something that you don't see it really,

00:23:21.162 --> 00:23:26.864
but it's huge for SEO is that heading hierarchy,

00:23:27.858 --> 00:23:29.192
having to do that,

00:23:29.224 --> 00:23:31.974
and I explained that to somebody.

00:23:31.974 --> 00:23:35.142
I said, "Look, I can add this to your website,

00:23:35.170 --> 00:23:37.218
but I need to know your headings."

00:23:38.576 --> 00:23:39.872
She came back to me later,

00:23:39.892 --> 00:23:41.316
she grumbled about it at the time,

00:23:41.316 --> 00:23:42.510
and then she came back and she said,

00:23:43.644 --> 00:23:45.806
"I'm really glad that you made me do that."

00:23:45.806 --> 00:23:48.096
I said, "You got to think of this as an outline."

00:23:49.908 --> 00:23:51.970
She said, "It forced me to sit down

00:23:51.970 --> 00:23:53.084
and think about this,

00:23:53.116 --> 00:23:56.300
and I've a much better webpage now,

00:23:56.830 --> 00:23:58.598
and I'm really happy with it."

00:23:58.710 --> 00:24:00.030
I showed it to somebody

00:24:00.118 --> 00:24:03.058
and they want to include this

00:24:03.058 --> 00:24:04.406
as a chapter in their book.

00:24:04.848 --> 00:24:08.148
I was happy to see that it actually made

00:24:08.148 --> 00:24:09.244
a difference for her that she saw

00:24:09.244 --> 00:24:10.472
that was immediate other than me

00:24:10.472 --> 00:24:11.530
just being difficult.

00:24:14.064 --> 00:24:16.014
Ricky Blacker: I think one of the big things for me,

00:24:16.584 --> 00:24:19.444
that big site I told you about that

00:24:19.444 --> 00:24:21.738
the first one ever created and got paid for,

00:24:23.334 --> 00:24:24.448
one of the things I had to do

00:24:24.448 --> 00:24:27.072
with that was to import 7,000 products

00:24:27.072 --> 00:24:28.702
into the website manually.

00:24:29.896 --> 00:24:31.546
It was all beauty products.

00:24:31.592 --> 00:24:34.392
I got very good at adding images.

00:24:34.726 --> 00:24:36.250
One of the great things about WordPress

00:24:36.250 --> 00:24:38.674
is you can add in description,

00:24:38.674 --> 00:24:40.842
all the alt texts and all the descriptions

00:24:41.024 --> 00:24:44.846
to make the images accessible and all that.

00:24:44.870 --> 00:24:46.688
One of the things that I found

00:24:46.688 --> 00:24:49.462
when I was doing that, it's I guess,

00:24:49.462 --> 00:24:51.712
a little bit of a trick that I learned,

00:24:51.712 --> 00:24:54.838
which makes not only the images accessible

00:24:54.838 --> 00:24:57.382
and the website, for screen readers,

00:24:58.252 --> 00:24:59.932
but a little trick to make it accessible

00:24:59.932 --> 00:25:02.514
as a developer or a website owner,

00:25:03.578 --> 00:25:04.886
when you get a website

00:25:04.886 --> 00:25:06.322
with like thousands of images,

00:25:06.322 --> 00:25:08.074
you've been running the website for years

00:25:08.074 --> 00:25:09.566
and you've been uploading images,

00:25:09.684 --> 00:25:10.548
and you think,

00:25:10.574 --> 00:25:12.304
"I had an image about three years ago

00:25:12.304 --> 00:25:15.226
and I can't remember what it was called."

00:25:15.226 --> 00:25:16.516
Because a lot of times what we do

00:25:16.516 --> 00:25:18.260
is we upload the image as it is.

00:25:18.486 --> 00:25:20.782
A lot of times images come in with weird,

00:25:20.782 --> 00:25:25.422
like DSC74900 file names,

00:25:25.448 --> 00:25:26.804
and we just upload that

00:25:26.804 --> 00:25:28.458
and then we do all our alt text

00:25:28.458 --> 00:25:30.052
and we're happy with that.

00:25:30.312 --> 00:25:31.194
What I found was,

00:25:32.350 --> 00:25:34.306
before I was uploading it to WordPress,

00:25:34.306 --> 00:25:35.884
I was renaming the image

00:25:36.460 --> 00:25:37.936
with a description of what the image

00:25:37.936 --> 00:25:39.400
was as the file name.

00:25:39.726 --> 00:25:41.672
Because in a couple of years time,

00:25:41.672 --> 00:25:43.110
we could go back and instead of trying

00:25:43.110 --> 00:25:44.658
to find some random image

00:25:44.736 --> 00:25:46.190
through thousands of images,

00:25:46.190 --> 00:25:47.808
you could just do a search

00:25:47.808 --> 00:25:51.312
for what the description

00:25:51.312 --> 00:25:52.928
of what you're looking for

00:25:52.928 --> 00:25:54.272
and more likely to find it.

00:25:54.574 --> 00:25:59.994
I don't know if it has any SEO benefits at all,

00:26:00.018 --> 00:26:02.914
having a file name describing the image,

00:26:02.948 --> 00:26:04.566
but I figured it couldn't hurt either.

00:26:05.232 --> 00:26:07.264
That was just a little thing that I was doing,

00:26:07.432 --> 00:26:08.676
and it's one of the great things

00:26:08.676 --> 00:26:10.854
about WordPress is that ability

00:26:10.854 --> 00:26:13.826
to easily tag out images when needed,

00:26:13.868 --> 00:26:15.282
but just think about

00:26:15.338 --> 00:26:16.246
when you're uploading them,

00:26:16.246 --> 00:26:17.868
changing the actual file name,

00:26:18.152 --> 00:26:20.360
makes it easier down the track.

00:26:23.732 --> 00:26:25.194
Kelly: Right before our next question,

00:26:25.194 --> 00:26:27.996
I'll go ahead and just remind our audience

00:26:27.996 --> 00:26:29.736
that if you have any additional questions,

00:26:29.736 --> 00:26:32.252
go ahead and pop them in the Q&amp;A feature.

00:26:33.326 --> 00:26:36.804
One of the perennial topics

00:26:36.804 --> 00:26:40.066
is end-user experience.

00:26:40.106 --> 00:26:43.276
The ideal situation is that our end users

00:26:43.276 --> 00:26:45.648
are part of the design process

00:26:45.804 --> 00:26:48.016
from the very beginning.

00:26:48.078 --> 00:26:51.062
I'm wondering if the three of you

00:26:51.062 --> 00:26:54.640
have suggestions for how companies

00:26:54.778 --> 00:26:57.668
can get that end-user feedback that they need,

00:26:57.668 --> 00:26:59.498
knowing that maybe they may or may not

00:26:59.498 --> 00:27:00.992
have those employees

00:27:01.150 --> 00:27:03.320
actually working for them.

00:27:04.650 --> 00:27:05.920
I don't know, Adrienne,

00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:08.516
do you want to maybe start this one?

00:27:09.518 --> 00:27:10.574
[crosstalk]

00:27:12.788 --> 00:27:15.194
Adrienne: No, it's an excellent question,

00:27:15.224 --> 00:27:21.690
and I would say that I've found it a hard sell,

00:27:23.418 --> 00:27:26.048
but the larger the company,

00:27:26.048 --> 00:27:30.602
the more invested they are in making sure

00:27:30.602 --> 00:27:32.946
that they achieve legal compliance

00:27:32.946 --> 00:27:33.846
and that they really

00:27:33.846 --> 00:27:36.632
are reaching large audiences.

00:27:38.626 --> 00:27:40.866
One way to explain it to them is,

00:27:40.866 --> 00:27:43.598
"Hey, we need to hire a firm

00:27:43.598 --> 00:27:47.354
that will have testers

00:27:47.372 --> 00:27:49.246
that have various disabilities,

00:27:49.246 --> 00:27:50.210
and we want somebody

00:27:50.210 --> 00:27:52.684
that's a native screen reader user."

00:27:52.816 --> 00:27:55.120
That even people that are sighted,

00:27:55.120 --> 00:27:56.700
we can learn to use them,

00:27:56.700 --> 00:27:58.708
but that doesn't make us a native user

00:27:58.790 --> 00:28:01.224
and we're not going to use it the same way.

00:28:01.666 --> 00:28:03.724
I know that's something Amber Hinds

00:28:03.724 --> 00:28:07.056
talks about a lot, is that some of the people

00:28:07.056 --> 00:28:09.646
that she tests with laugh with her about,

00:28:09.646 --> 00:28:12.432
"Hey nobody really reads it

00:28:12.484 --> 00:28:14.106
the way you're using it."

00:28:14.436 --> 00:28:17.260
It's really is important to understand

00:28:17.980 --> 00:28:19.384
you can do things

00:28:19.384 --> 00:28:21.278
that certainly with a keyboard for yourself

00:28:22.432 --> 00:28:23.730
and those kinds of things,

00:28:23.730 --> 00:28:28.474
but you can also run all of the tests of, "Hey--"

00:28:28.868 --> 00:28:30.304
You can probably find somebody

00:28:30.304 --> 00:28:32.372
that's colorblind in your company,

00:28:32.502 --> 00:28:34.768
but you can use a lot of those simulators

00:28:34.866 --> 00:28:36.254
and that can help,

00:28:36.288 --> 00:28:39.950
but definitely using somebody that really

00:28:39.950 --> 00:28:41.250
has that disability

00:28:41.250 --> 00:28:42.576
is always going to be the best.

00:28:44.966 --> 00:28:46.546
Ricky Onsman: I'd agree with that.

00:28:46.546 --> 00:28:48.734
I think if companies,

00:28:48.734 --> 00:28:51.988
if web clients have a budget for it,

00:28:51.988 --> 00:28:53.252
then that's one of the things

00:28:53.252 --> 00:28:53.914
that they should put

00:28:53.914 --> 00:28:54.838
some money towards

00:28:54.838 --> 00:28:58.016
is to doing testing with real uses.

00:28:58.786 --> 00:29:00.420
Mind you, having said that,

00:29:00.420 --> 00:29:01.994
for my smaller clients,

00:29:01.994 --> 00:29:06.904
from a cheese shop to a refrigeration vendor,

00:29:07.052 --> 00:29:08.946
I'll call on friends.

00:29:09.072 --> 00:29:13.758
What I do find is that one small breakthrough

00:29:13.758 --> 00:29:15.426
can lead to a lot more.

00:29:15.664 --> 00:29:18.304
Getting one friend who's blind to sit there

00:29:18.304 --> 00:29:20.374
and use somebody's website

00:29:20.764 --> 00:29:23.000
in front of their web developers

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:25.896
and designers and content authors

00:29:25.896 --> 00:29:27.354
and project managers,

00:29:27.964 --> 00:29:30.464
they are stunned every time

00:29:30.464 --> 00:29:32.752
at how inaccessible their websites are.

00:29:32.752 --> 00:29:34.856
When they see somebody actually trying

00:29:34.856 --> 00:29:36.912
to buy a product of theirs online,

00:29:37.012 --> 00:29:39.068
it has such an impact on them

00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:41.944
that it often leads to when you say,

00:29:41.944 --> 00:29:43.824
"Right, now we've got to test with other people,"

00:29:44.054 --> 00:29:46.186
and they go, "Look, test with whoever you need to.

00:29:46.422 --> 00:29:49.416
This is, this has been such a revelation to us."

00:29:49.660 --> 00:29:53.062
Getting that first breakthrough of showing it,

00:29:53.062 --> 00:29:56.310
and often for me, it is having a blind person

00:29:56.310 --> 00:29:58.356
trying to buy a product online.

00:29:58.718 --> 00:30:03.178
It makes such a breakthrough for them

00:30:03.178 --> 00:30:05.020
that it has a very positive effect

00:30:05.072 --> 00:30:07.528
for pretty much everything else you say.

00:30:09.706 --> 00:30:11.462
Ricky Blacker: I agree with all that.

00:30:11.462 --> 00:30:13.570
I think there are also two, one of the things

00:30:13.570 --> 00:30:15.172
that I like to make people aware of

00:30:15.172 --> 00:30:18.418
is while making websites accessible

00:30:18.418 --> 00:30:19.634
for people with disabilities

00:30:19.634 --> 00:30:20.640
is probably one

00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:22.460
of the most important things we do,

00:30:22.608 --> 00:30:24.010
but when we talk about accessibility,

00:30:24.010 --> 00:30:25.134
we mean accessibility

00:30:25.134 --> 00:30:26.370
for absolutely everyone.

00:30:26.442 --> 00:30:30.304
Sometimes, websites are inaccessible

00:30:30.304 --> 00:30:31.950
to people without disabilities

00:30:31.950 --> 00:30:33.802
because of the way that they've been designed,

00:30:33.802 --> 00:30:35.938
or other factors.

00:30:35.938 --> 00:30:37.860
I know I've had issues with sites.

00:30:37.860 --> 00:30:39.382
Sometimes, you get on the site

00:30:39.382 --> 00:30:40.328
and it's really frustrating

00:30:40.328 --> 00:30:42.294
and you just don't want

00:30:42.294 --> 00:30:43.512
to go forward anymore.

00:30:43.570 --> 00:30:48.276
I think obviously it gets surfaced

00:30:48.276 --> 00:30:49.578
when people with disabilities

00:30:49.578 --> 00:30:50.646
are testing websites,

00:30:50.776 --> 00:30:53.050
but I think that's one of the things we have to--

00:30:53.050 --> 00:30:56.558
Apart from, is it are we ticking

00:30:56.558 --> 00:30:58.404
all the boxes for people with disabilities,

00:30:58.404 --> 00:31:00.026
but are we ticking all the boxes

00:31:00.026 --> 00:31:01.962
for people just to access the website

00:31:01.962 --> 00:31:02.780
in a normal way?

00:31:04.760 --> 00:31:06.198
I had an issue with a--

00:31:06.198 --> 00:31:10.132
There was a home show just last year,

00:31:10.132 --> 00:31:12.254
I think it was, and they had it in Australia

00:31:12.254 --> 00:31:14.714
and Brisbane and they had an email form

00:31:14.794 --> 00:31:18.294
to get tickets, and I could never get tickets.

00:31:18.492 --> 00:31:20.596
They never sent me the tickets and I tried it.

00:31:20.596 --> 00:31:22.006
Finally, I found out the reason

00:31:22.006 --> 00:31:24.046
why it was in the email form,

00:31:24.046 --> 00:31:26.084
it said how many people, two,

00:31:26.084 --> 00:31:28.280
and I filled out my details and I hit submit,

00:31:28.488 --> 00:31:31.060
and you would expect that would be it.

00:31:31.194 --> 00:31:33.532
You've submitted your detail, it's all done,

00:31:34.466 --> 00:31:37.006
but no, because refreshed the form,

00:31:37.006 --> 00:31:38.106
you're used to that behavior,

00:31:38.106 --> 00:31:39.156
refreshing the form.

00:31:39.512 --> 00:31:41.188
What I didn't notice was a little thing

00:31:41.188 --> 00:31:42.084
at the top that said,

00:31:42.110 --> 00:31:43.856
"Enter in second person's details,"

00:31:43.856 --> 00:31:45.014
because I was taking my wife,

00:31:45.172 --> 00:31:48.286
and until I entered two people's details,

00:31:48.286 --> 00:31:50.378
it wasn't submitting the form completely

00:31:50.378 --> 00:31:51.534
and I wasn't getting my tickets.

00:31:51.598 --> 00:31:53.168
As we know in accessibility,

00:31:53.168 --> 00:31:54.532
that's expected behavior.

00:31:54.532 --> 00:31:57.188
You expect when you hit submit,

00:31:57.208 --> 00:31:58.168
you've submitted,

00:31:58.186 --> 00:32:00.336
and unless there's a big warning to say,

00:32:00.336 --> 00:32:01.850
"Please submit more information,"

00:32:01.876 --> 00:32:03.402
you think you're done.

00:32:03.428 --> 00:32:05.800
I think when we're talking about

00:32:05.932 --> 00:32:09.198
accessibility and testing, it's a small thing.

00:32:09.198 --> 00:32:10.678
It probably ticked all the boxes

00:32:10.678 --> 00:32:13.172
as far as people being able to see the form,

00:32:13.996 --> 00:32:16.038
but I wasn't able to complete the form,

00:32:16.514 --> 00:32:17.764
which was really interesting.

00:32:20.426 --> 00:32:21.168
Kelly: That's right.

00:32:21.272 --> 00:32:22.396
Adrienne: That's a good point.

00:32:23.232 --> 00:32:24.088
Kelly: All right.

00:32:24.114 --> 00:32:27.122
We have a question here in our Q&amp;A,

00:32:27.362 --> 00:32:30.440
that I'll just go ahead and read.

00:32:30.626 --> 00:32:34.042
"I'm assuming you've all dealt with people

00:32:34.042 --> 00:32:35.930
who absolutely refuse to accept

00:32:35.930 --> 00:32:38.226
accessibility as a necessity.

00:32:38.578 --> 00:32:41.012
Do you find yourself continuing to deal

00:32:41.012 --> 00:32:43.148
with these people in a gentle manner,

00:32:43.250 --> 00:32:44.992
or do you find yourself leaning into

00:32:44.992 --> 00:32:47.336
more harsh, no-nonsense approaches,

00:32:47.492 --> 00:32:48.856
or maybe both?"

00:32:51.892 --> 00:32:53.770
Who wants to start that one?

00:32:54.530 --> 00:32:55.208
[laughter]

00:32:55.208 --> 00:32:56.578
Ricky Onsman: I'll go first on that one.

00:32:56.632 --> 00:32:57.936
I'm old and grumpy,

00:32:57.998 --> 00:33:01.730
and I'm just sick of taking that nonsense.

00:33:01.818 --> 00:33:04.642
I'm now at the point where I go,

00:33:04.678 --> 00:33:06.400
I'll give a little bit of leeway, but look,

00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:07.602
if you do not want to make

00:33:07.602 --> 00:33:08.734
your website accessible,

00:33:08.734 --> 00:33:10.152
then I am not the designer

00:33:10.152 --> 00:33:11.764
or front-end developer for you.

00:33:12.694 --> 00:33:13.778
Take it or leave it.

00:33:18.296 --> 00:33:19.742
Adrienne: I know I work in a company

00:33:19.742 --> 00:33:23.512
where it is a legal requirement,

00:33:23.616 --> 00:33:25.270
and that's recognized.

00:33:28.862 --> 00:33:31.040
Some people are absolutely like,

00:33:31.056 --> 00:33:32.410
"This is amazing. I can't believe

00:33:32.410 --> 00:33:33.796
I didn't know about this before."

00:33:33.866 --> 00:33:35.800
I know for others,

00:33:35.832 --> 00:33:44.494
it can feel like just another huge task,

00:33:44.522 --> 00:33:45.744
and it feels more onerous

00:33:45.770 --> 00:33:47.900
because they don't necessarily understand it

00:33:47.900 --> 00:33:49.348
or know a lot about it,

00:33:49.376 --> 00:33:51.380
so I think it feels weightier

00:33:51.410 --> 00:33:53.964
than if they knew about it,

00:33:54.002 --> 00:33:57.116
and it felt like common knowledge.

00:33:57.166 --> 00:33:59.374
I think that that's part of it.

00:34:01.834 --> 00:34:05.244
Yes, it can be very frustrating at times,

00:34:05.336 --> 00:34:09.034
but I think recognizing that maybe

00:34:09.034 --> 00:34:12.998
they haven't made that correlation of,

00:34:13.266 --> 00:34:15.868
hey, a senior in their family

00:34:15.868 --> 00:34:18.270
that maybe has Parkinson's

00:34:18.270 --> 00:34:21.780
and has a shaky hand and it's difficult to use

00:34:21.780 --> 00:34:23.434
a mouse or a trackpad,

00:34:24.732 --> 00:34:27.298
that it could be somebody that they know.

00:34:27.326 --> 00:34:30.920
It doesn't just have to be the extremes

00:34:30.944 --> 00:34:34.000
of somebody who absolutely has no vision

00:34:34.056 --> 00:34:37.534
or is using a sip and puff, something like that.

00:34:37.550 --> 00:34:38.992
They think in the extremes,

00:34:39.196 --> 00:34:41.452
and that feels very difficult.

00:34:41.638 --> 00:34:43.192
You just kind of have to--

00:34:43.648 --> 00:34:47.280
A little bit at a time, a little bit at a time.

00:34:48.282 --> 00:34:50.600
Ricky Blacker: For a lot of people,

00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:53.492
it's daunting, and unless you build in

00:34:53.492 --> 00:34:55.500
accessibility right from the very beginning,

00:34:55.742 --> 00:34:57.086
if you already have a website

00:34:57.086 --> 00:34:58.508
and it's not accessible,

00:34:59.596 --> 00:35:00.870
it can be very daunting.

00:35:00.870 --> 00:35:01.838
It can be costly,

00:35:01.838 --> 00:35:03.320
it can be time-consuming to do that,

00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:04.930
and we really do have to think about

00:35:04.948 --> 00:35:07.250
building it in from the very beginning.

00:35:07.284 --> 00:35:09.428
I think when you're trying

00:35:09.428 --> 00:35:10.702
to make people see why,

00:35:10.702 --> 00:35:14.070
I always refer back to do analogies

00:35:14.096 --> 00:35:15.108
of brick-and-mortar stores

00:35:15.120 --> 00:35:15.996
and things like that

00:35:16.026 --> 00:35:17.298
because it's more relatable.

00:35:17.314 --> 00:35:21.198
Digital seems unrelatable for some people.

00:35:21.220 --> 00:35:22.860
If you had a brick-and-mortar store,

00:35:22.860 --> 00:35:23.560
you want to make that

00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:25.102
as accessible to people,

00:35:25.180 --> 00:35:26.658
especially if you've got an online store.

00:35:26.658 --> 00:35:28.082
You're trying to get people to--

00:35:28.170 --> 00:35:30.472
Whatever you're doing with your website,

00:35:30.714 --> 00:35:31.406
you've got to make it

00:35:31.406 --> 00:35:32.710
as accessible as possible,

00:35:32.710 --> 00:35:36.208
and if you don't, people just don't go there.

00:35:36.232 --> 00:35:37.690
That's the big thing with the web

00:35:37.698 --> 00:35:40.340
is that there's usually 100 sites

00:35:40.384 --> 00:35:41.414
doing the same thing,

00:35:42.072 --> 00:35:43.544
and people will go to the fastest,

00:35:43.570 --> 00:35:45.448
most accessible site they can find,

00:35:45.802 --> 00:35:48.066
and they'll vote with their feet

00:35:48.108 --> 00:35:49.902
as they walk away to another website.

00:35:50.136 --> 00:35:52.166
You don't know.

00:35:52.188 --> 00:35:54.280
People don't know what business they're losing.

00:35:54.358 --> 00:35:55.282
We can measure

00:35:55.282 --> 00:35:56.546
how much business we're getting,

00:35:56.546 --> 00:35:58.276
but we don't know the ones

00:35:58.276 --> 00:35:59.398
that are walking past

00:35:59.422 --> 00:36:00.892
because there's problems.

00:36:00.902 --> 00:36:03.148
I guess it's just making them aware

00:36:03.162 --> 00:36:05.736
that these things are important,

00:36:05.882 --> 00:36:09.612
not just for ticking a box,

00:36:09.640 --> 00:36:12.746
but for the health of your website

00:36:13.122 --> 00:36:14.758
to get through whatever.

00:36:14.974 --> 00:36:16.582
Unless it's just a cat blog,

00:36:16.582 --> 00:36:17.540
and you don't really care

00:36:17.540 --> 00:36:18.798
if anybody sees it or not.

00:36:18.872 --> 00:36:21.840
I'm not making bad things about cat blogs,

00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:22.540
I love cats.

00:36:22.544 --> 00:36:23.422
[chuckles]

00:36:23.442 --> 00:36:26.758
I think if you've got a purpose for your website,

00:36:26.758 --> 00:36:28.970
if you need to get customers or people

00:36:28.970 --> 00:36:30.376
to your website for a reason,

00:36:30.986 --> 00:36:32.366
don't make it hard for them.

00:36:32.558 --> 00:36:34.242
Make it as easy as possible,

00:36:34.242 --> 00:36:35.720
and that is worth the time

00:36:35.720 --> 00:36:37.438
and the effort and the money to do that.

00:36:38.610 --> 00:36:39.852
Ricky Onsman: I will add that

00:36:39.886 --> 00:36:41.784
in my job these days,

00:36:41.846 --> 00:36:44.104
I do less of the direct designing

00:36:44.104 --> 00:36:45.756
and front-end development myself,

00:36:45.756 --> 00:36:47.972
but I work with clients who have

00:36:48.014 --> 00:36:49.918
quite large teams of designers

00:36:49.918 --> 00:36:52.658
and developers who know that they have to.

00:36:52.690 --> 00:36:54.588
There is a requirement, a legal requirement,

00:36:54.588 --> 00:36:55.258
that they've got to make

00:36:55.258 --> 00:36:56.654
their websites accessible,

00:36:56.726 --> 00:36:57.810
but they come back with,

00:36:57.844 --> 00:37:00.120
"Well, we can't do it. It can't be done."

00:37:00.550 --> 00:37:03.300
That's fodder for me.

00:37:03.300 --> 00:37:05.150
"Yes, it can, and I'll show you how."

00:37:06.402 --> 00:37:09.318
It's often when you get technical with them,

00:37:09.496 --> 00:37:13.052
they go, "Oh, right. I didn't know we could do that."

00:37:14.184 --> 00:37:17.720
It's often a very technical exercise.

00:37:18.432 --> 00:37:21.206
I don't meet so much resistance these days

00:37:21.206 --> 00:37:24.122
from our clients because they're working

00:37:24.154 --> 00:37:25.284
for a large corporation

00:37:25.284 --> 00:37:27.074
and they know it's a legal requirement.

00:37:27.222 --> 00:37:30.332
Their bosses have said it has to be accessible.

00:37:30.602 --> 00:37:32.800
Their problem is how do they do it.

00:37:33.042 --> 00:37:34.802
They don't have the skills to do it.

00:37:34.890 --> 00:37:36.688
A lot of them because they haven't really

00:37:36.688 --> 00:37:39.652
learned basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,

00:37:40.606 --> 00:37:43.232
so they're surprised to find that it can be done.

00:37:43.890 --> 00:37:46.740
I might add that a lot of the stuff

00:37:46.740 --> 00:37:49.082
that we work with, like React frameworks,

00:37:49.268 --> 00:37:51.410
no, accessibility is not built in,

00:37:51.568 --> 00:37:53.680
but it also isn't obstructed.

00:37:53.904 --> 00:37:56.748
You have to know how to inject accessibility

00:37:56.748 --> 00:37:58.120
into a React framework,

00:37:58.120 --> 00:37:59.706
and once you get that technical,

00:37:59.706 --> 00:38:00.596
yes, it can be done.

00:38:00.620 --> 00:38:01.800
Of course, it can be done.

00:38:05.348 --> 00:38:08.650
Kelly: We have one quick question,

00:38:08.650 --> 00:38:11.382
I believe, in the chat or in the Q&amp;A,

00:38:11.464 --> 00:38:13.428
and then I have one final question

00:38:13.444 --> 00:38:14.724
for everyone here.

00:38:15.254 --> 00:38:18.026
The question in the Q&amp;A is,

00:38:18.044 --> 00:38:21.564
"What's your go-to for a good starter theme

00:38:21.590 --> 00:38:24.024
for a good baseline?"

00:38:28.130 --> 00:38:30.668
Ricky Onsman: Well, I've already said

00:38:30.690 --> 00:38:32.162
I'm a fan of Astra.

00:38:32.222 --> 00:38:35.808
I see a lot of comments on the accessibility

00:38:35.808 --> 00:38:37.450
Slack channels that, no,

00:38:37.562 --> 00:38:40.060
Astra is not accessible, and that is true,

00:38:40.212 --> 00:38:41.838
but Astra is very good,

00:38:41.838 --> 00:38:43.776
it can be made accessible.

00:38:44.788 --> 00:38:46.604
Basically, like I would say,

00:38:46.708 --> 00:38:49.074
any theme that has

00:38:49.090 --> 00:38:51.262
a customization facility in it,

00:38:51.350 --> 00:38:53.598
that stores your customization

00:38:53.598 --> 00:38:55.284
in a separate style sheet,

00:38:55.422 --> 00:38:56.822
is a good place to start.

00:38:56.838 --> 00:38:59.316
If it doesn't have that, avoid it.

00:38:59.832 --> 00:39:02.898
You want it to be stored separately,

00:39:02.898 --> 00:39:04.810
so that when the theme is upgraded,

00:39:04.952 --> 00:39:06.436
that it doesn't throw away

00:39:06.436 --> 00:39:07.862
all your customization.

00:39:07.976 --> 00:39:10.022
Something that gives you

00:39:10.022 --> 00:39:13.016
the opportunity to customize it, to add CSS,

00:39:13.016 --> 00:39:15.720
to add styling and functionality

00:39:15.830 --> 00:39:17.780
that you know is accessible,

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:18.998
that's the way to go.

00:39:19.030 --> 00:39:20.440
For me, that's Astra.

00:39:20.466 --> 00:39:21.218
I love it.

00:39:24.160 --> 00:39:26.668
Ricky Blacker: For me, it's the Frost theme.

00:39:27.516 --> 00:39:28.492
Once again,

00:39:28.878 --> 00:39:31.124
it's not so much how accessible it is,

00:39:31.124 --> 00:39:32.498
it's how accessible you can make it.

00:39:32.498 --> 00:39:35.948
Frost theme is just a very simple, basic theme,

00:39:35.972 --> 00:39:39.142
it uses the full-site editing

00:39:39.160 --> 00:39:40.410
that we're starting to see

00:39:40.410 --> 00:39:42.056
come into WordPress themes now,

00:39:42.056 --> 00:39:43.860
where you can edit the header and the footer,

00:39:43.860 --> 00:39:47.468
and you can do all the things

00:39:47.468 --> 00:39:48.352
you need to do with it.

00:39:48.676 --> 00:39:51.788
That's just my go-to one at the moment.

00:39:54.080 --> 00:39:56.488
Adrienne: I saw somebody mentioned Cadence,

00:39:56.502 --> 00:39:57.982
which I've heard good things about.

00:39:57.982 --> 00:40:04.100
I have not used it personally, but again,

00:40:04.114 --> 00:40:05.346
several people have said that,

00:40:05.346 --> 00:40:06.482
and I would agree

00:40:06.510 --> 00:40:09.632
with what both Rickys have said,

00:40:09.644 --> 00:40:14.004
which is that it really is about starting

00:40:14.004 --> 00:40:15.816
with something that's maybe clean enough

00:40:15.816 --> 00:40:18.688
that you can go in and make it accessible.

00:40:20.996 --> 00:40:24.404
Kelly: Then actually I had a really

00:40:24.404 --> 00:40:25.588
silly question for all of you,

00:40:25.588 --> 00:40:28.174
but we have an actual practical question

00:40:28.174 --> 00:40:29.738
that's come in here on the Q&amp;A.

00:40:29.772 --> 00:40:32.126
"Do any of you use insight surveys

00:40:32.126 --> 00:40:34.298
to collect info from your audience

00:40:34.376 --> 00:40:35.500
on your website?

00:40:36.590 --> 00:40:39.274
Is it recommended or not?"

00:40:42.630 --> 00:40:43.660
Adrienne: I'm not sure.

00:40:45.056 --> 00:40:48.390
You mean like a survey of your users,

00:40:48.390 --> 00:40:51.206
your user base, emailing them a survey?

00:40:51.658 --> 00:40:53.176
I'm sorry, I'm not sure.

00:40:53.712 --> 00:40:56.576
Kelly: If you want to provide clarification

00:40:56.576 --> 00:40:59.082
on your question in the chat, we can--

00:40:59.082 --> 00:41:00.052
Adrienne: I want to make sure

00:41:00.052 --> 00:41:02.060
we're answering this appropriately.

00:41:08.136 --> 00:41:10.932
Kelly: "Do any of you use insight surveys

00:41:10.932 --> 00:41:12.730
to collect info from your audience

00:41:12.816 --> 00:41:15.332
on your website ease of use."

00:41:16.048 --> 00:41:19.992
Oh, on whether or not your website

00:41:19.992 --> 00:41:21.488
was navigable.

00:41:21.582 --> 00:41:23.012
Got it. Thank you.

00:41:23.036 --> 00:41:25.166
Adrienne: Yes, definitely.

00:41:25.446 --> 00:41:26.606
In design phase,

00:41:26.636 --> 00:41:29.534
you want to do some user testing.

00:41:29.664 --> 00:41:31.338
You can start even with basic

00:41:31.354 --> 00:41:34.194
in wireframes even,

00:41:34.274 --> 00:41:35.410
and then, of course, yes,

00:41:35.508 --> 00:41:36.716
as part of your final testing,

00:41:36.738 --> 00:41:37.916
because you want to make sure that

00:41:37.932 --> 00:41:39.372
you don't have a big oops.

00:41:41.140 --> 00:41:43.584
Ricky Onsman: I tend to, both on my own site

00:41:43.584 --> 00:41:45.120
and the sites that I build,

00:41:45.138 --> 00:41:47.332
I have an accessibility statement,

00:41:47.490 --> 00:41:52.036
and that is, it makes a claim for saying that,

00:41:52.036 --> 00:41:54.688
"We try to make this website conformant

00:41:54.718 --> 00:41:58.524
to a minimum of WCAG 2.2 level AA.

00:41:58.598 --> 00:42:01.134
If you find anything that doesn't conform

00:42:01.134 --> 00:42:02.210
to those standards,

00:42:02.258 --> 00:42:04.806
or if you have difficulty accessing

00:42:04.806 --> 00:42:06.268
any part of this website,

00:42:06.268 --> 00:42:07.772
then take this action."

00:42:07.804 --> 00:42:09.460
Whether that's filling in a form

00:42:09.460 --> 00:42:11.464
or just sending us an email or whatever.

00:42:11.630 --> 00:42:15.338
I don't generally survey people

00:42:15.368 --> 00:42:16.366
in the sense of,

00:42:16.398 --> 00:42:18.350
"Here's a form for you to fill in

00:42:18.350 --> 00:42:20.430
about what you did and didn't like

00:42:20.430 --> 00:42:22.112
or couldn't use about it,"

00:42:22.162 --> 00:42:24.190
but I leave it up to individual people

00:42:24.190 --> 00:42:26.280
to speak up about what did

00:42:26.280 --> 00:42:27.552
and didn't work for them.

00:42:29.832 --> 00:42:31.656
Ricky Blacker: My answer is going to be very quick.

00:42:31.656 --> 00:42:33.638
I actually haven't designed

00:42:33.638 --> 00:42:34.672
a website for a long time,

00:42:34.672 --> 00:42:36.312
but if I did in the future,

00:42:36.312 --> 00:42:38.930
I would definitely add a feature like that

00:42:38.930 --> 00:42:39.982
to get the feedback.

00:42:39.982 --> 00:42:41.376
I think it's very important.

00:42:44.380 --> 00:42:45.310
Kelly: Well, with that,

00:42:45.328 --> 00:42:47.030
we're pretty much out of time.

00:42:47.910 --> 00:42:50.300
If there are questions in the Q&amp;A

00:42:50.300 --> 00:42:51.842
that still need to be addressed,

00:42:51.842 --> 00:42:53.428
we can address those.

00:42:53.586 --> 00:42:55.842
We can continue them in the chat,

00:42:55.930 --> 00:42:58.504
and I want to thank everyone here,

00:42:58.504 --> 00:43:00.720
Adrienne, Ricky, and Ricky for jumping in

00:43:00.720 --> 00:43:03.330

00:43:11.118 --> 00:43:12.872

in the chat right now or on social media

00:43:15.572 --> 00:43:19.548

00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:25.720
and hashtag #WPAD20242024.

00:43:25.852 --> 00:43:28.236
We also appreciate it if you go to
