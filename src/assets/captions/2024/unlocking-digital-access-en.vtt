Announcer: WordPress
Accessibility Day 2024,

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.279
Unlocking Digital Access:

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:09.359
Insights from a Community-Driven Survey,
with speakers Norbert Rum,

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.579
Senior Accessibility
Specialist at American Eagle,

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:16.759
and Nick Goodrum, Director
of Accessibility at American Eagle.

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.640
This presentation
was recorded October 2024.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.919
Jessica Sams: Welcome to WordPress
Accessibility Day 2024.

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.440
My name is Jessica Sams
of Yolantis Website Mentor.

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.439
Thanks for joining us
for Unlocking Digital Access:

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.879
Insights from a Community-Driven Survey,

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:43.160
with Nick Goodrum and Norbert Rum.

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:44.919
Feel free to add your questions

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.759
in the Zoom Q&amp;A section
as you think of them,

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.599
and we'll do our best to respond
to them at the end of the session.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.439
You'll use the chat to connect
with other attendees.

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.359
If you look at your icons
on the bottom of your Zoom,

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.839
if you're attending live,
you have a chat and look at that for maybe

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:07.159
messages from your technical support,
and you have a Q&amp;A.

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:08.519
That's the one with the question mark.

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.319
That's the one you want to pop
your question in if you want

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:16.439
your panelists to actually see
your question and have us answer it.

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.248
Let me go ahead
and introduce Nick Goodrum first.

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.519
Nick has been working
in the front-end development

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.239
world for well over a decade and a half.

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.119
During the journey of improving his code

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.159
with modern techniques and best practices,

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:34.519
he found a deep passion
for usability and accessibility.

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.319
At the full-service digital agency,
americaneagle.com, he grew

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.039
into the position of Director of Front-End

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.199
Development and then shifted his main
focus as Director of Accessibility.

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.719
As a certified professional
in web accessibility,

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:54.279
Nick has been educating technical
communities and empowering clients,

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.599
including those in Fortune 500,

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.639
by sharing his knowledge
of the inner workings of the web mixed

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.759
with the insights of accessibility needs.

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.119
He aims to help make accessibility

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:09.039
a normality rather
than an afterthought to developers,

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:14.520
content authors, marketing,
site owners, and beyond.

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.959
Let me go ahead and introduce
our second speaker, Norbert Rum.

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.719
With more than 20 years of experience,

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.839
Norbert has carved out
a distinguished career

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.099
in the digital world
of accessibility, SEO/SEM.

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:34.079
His journey is marked by leading
successful accessibility solutions,

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.959
including conducting
look-ahead compliance audits and founding

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.639
a thriving online community

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.839
for the visually impaired
over a decade ago,

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.599
which now boasts over 23,000 members.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.599
This initiative highlights his dedication

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.519
to making digital spaces inclusive,

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.170
particularly for those
with visual impairments.

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.066
As an experienced speaker
at industry events like CSUN,

00:02:58.067 --> 00:03:02.319
Norbert's approach effectively
blends technical proficiency

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.839
with an in-depth understanding
of user needs.

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.639
This perspective is shared
directly by end users,

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.679
ensuring that digital platforms

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.119
are not only compliant
but also engaging and user-friendly.

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.039
In his work,
Norbert adopts a client-focused view,

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:20.039
striving to transform
digital landscapes into an accessible,

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.480
impactful, and approachable experience.

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.559
I'll ask you to take it away.

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:26.799
Let's go.

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.679
Nick Goodrum: All right,
I'll start sharing screen.

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.520
Give me one second.

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.200
Should be coming through.

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.599
So, yes, thanks for the introductions.

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.666
Yes, so I'm Nick Goodrum.

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:50.839
People always say americaneagle.com
it's been confused plenty

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.719
of times when we've interacted
with people.

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.679
Yes, no, not the airline.

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:58.879
No, not the, what is it,
the clothing company,

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:00.239
furniture store, whatever you're thinking.

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:02.199
No, it's a full-service digital agency.

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.514
We've been around for a bit.

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.199
Norbert and I want to kind of talk

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:12.200
through the survey that we initiated
with online communities.

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:16.809
With that, Norbert,
do you want to take it away?

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:22.444
Norbert Rum: My name is Norbert Rum,
and I will go to another survey.

00:04:22.445 --> 00:04:25.920
Well, let's start
the main reason behind it.

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:30.679
The main reason
is about over 10 years ago,

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:34.319
I started a community
on Reddit called r/Blind.

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:39.613
With r/Blind,
which has over 26,000 subscribed readers,

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:46.959
almost 35,000 unique active users a month,

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:53.640
almost 1,000 active Discord users,
and over the past few years,

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:57.239
we noticed the members had differences

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:00.720
from surveys that are globally available.

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:04.373
The voices did not match the stats.

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:10.520
From different online communities as well,

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:14.999
I wanted to make sure that I provided

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.960
a megaphone to every single
user to provide feedback.

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:23.690
Nick: Yes, and what's
interesting with r/Blind,

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:29.579
it was originally for like actual blind
sales, like for Windows, right?

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:30.869
Norbert: Yes.

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:33.479
It started with Window blinds,

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:37.259
and I made sure to take
that spam away and remove it,

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:42.140
and move it to
the next chapter of its life

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:45.354
and made it into a nice, beautiful home.

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:48.119
Nick: Yes, that's where
a lot of this is around Reddit,

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:49.439
and that was our starting point.

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:51.699
That's why I think even in the image

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:54.219
is actually the Reddit snoo,

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:57.679
actually the Reddit blind
snoo version, right?

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:59.839
Norbert: We had two snoos.

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:02.071
One is the new Reddit logo,

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:06.999
and the second snoo logo
is a special one created

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.440
by one of our users
that represents r/Blind.

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:14.440
It was a great add-on to our community.

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:21.880
Let's go on reasons for this survey.

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:25.999
Many developers and site maintainers

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.879
reference WebAIM and the survey results,
and which we do as well.

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:33.399
We wanted to reach out to Jared Smith,

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:39.240
and talk to him and look at his results,
and see what we could add to it.

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:42.619
The community online is a bit different

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:44.599
than some other communities.

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:48.091
We wanted to get
a comparison chart together.

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:51.999
We reached out to other organizations
and also other accessibility

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.399
specialists on Reddit
and outside of Reddit,

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:59.780
including people that created

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:04.080
the WCAG guidelines and professionals

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:07.799
on that subject matter.

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:11.039
We brought in the questions to include

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:14.159
also communities
like the cerebral palsy community

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:18.560
and the autism community
and other communities

00:07:18.639 --> 00:07:21.839
that should be referenced in this survey,
like such as this.

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:24.959
Nick: Yes, and Jared, I mean,
really, when we were interacting with him,

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:27.199
I mean, he was saying, yes,
actually do another survey,

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:31.079
because if anything,
it would reinforce what his findings are,

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:33.399
because it's not the first time
he's ever heard that.

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:36.239
It's like, oh, yes, people
didn't really agree with the findings.

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:39.739
It was like, okay, well, either A,
you're going to find similar results,

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:41.399
or B, you're going
to find different results.

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:42.019
Great.

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:45.519
Now it gives us a sense
of where the different types of users,

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:49.328
and it shows the more diversity
involved with it.

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:51.879
That's why we wanted to dive a bit deeper.

00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:52.599
Norbert: Yes.

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:55.199
We wanted to confirm our own understanding

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:58.679
of the user utilization
of one or more devices.

00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:01.159
We wanted to confirm
our online communities,

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:07.440
and international users are not just
from the US, but outside the US.

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:10.559
We're trying to provide
more insight on how to better develop

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:13.199
websites to determine the pain points,

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:17.200
and find solutions,
hopefully, for the future.

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:21.039
Nick: Yes, as developers ourselves,
it was like, okay,

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:24.199
let's see if we can extrapolate a bit,
because there's a lot of myths

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:28.039
and a lot of misunderstandings
of how people use the web.

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:30.602
Norbert: We started the survey.

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:35.320
During the launch of the survey,
something happened.

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:41.040
Accessibility became
the front of a key issue.

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:45.959
Last year when we ran
the survey on r/Blind

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:48.274
and a few other communities,

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:54.880
Reddit made decisions that changed
how users experience Reddit.

00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:58.319
There's a cost to the API.

00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:02.240
There was issues with the screen readers

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:06.447
for third-party tools
that were used to use Reddit.

00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:08.560
This opened a floodgate.

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:15.519
During this,
Reddit users and moderators decided

00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:20.320
to group together and cause a blackout.

00:09:20.512 --> 00:09:24.720
What a blackout means
is we turn off the subreddit.

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:30.840
One group, r/Blind,
decided to do this as well.

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:36.159
The moderators of r/Blind could not use

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:38.839
the button to actually turn it off.

00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:40.906
The button was unlabeled.

00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:45.679
I made a post about this and went to bed.

00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:51.220
Next morning,
it went viral and eventually ended up

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:56.410
on The Verge
and The New York Times and WBUR.

00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:01.919
During this blackout,
a subreddit such as Apple,

00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:06.599
which has millions of subscribers,
and our videos,

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:12.440
which has millions of subscribers,
dedicated their shutdown to r/Blind.

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:18.879
Post-blackout, r/Blind intensified
its push for accessibility on Reddit,

00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:22.159
engaging even with
the corporate staff of Reddit.

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:25.999
There have been multiple
rounds of fixing for accessibility

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.412
on Reddit itself
and the application itself.

00:10:30.159 --> 00:10:36.239
It helped achieve something new,
which provided a voice for accessibility

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:39.200
for r/Blind and for its users.

00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:43.399
Nick: It's a good reminder that, again,

00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:47.319
even the people that may feel
like they don't have a voice,

00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:52.398
they can actually have a major impact
on even large corporations.

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:55.239
Yes, then what is on the survey?

00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:58.859
A wide variety of items,
so covering aspects

00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:01.679
like demographics, the typical stuff.

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:03.959
A lot of it was aligned
with WebAIM, right?

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:08.319
A lot of the initial questions
were trying to pair and match with it,

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:10.399
since Jared wanted to also get feedback

00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:12.679
to see if it would be
drastically different.

00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:15.719
There's a lot more to this one,
since it's not just for screen readers.

00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:18.799
It's for a variety of different devices.

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:21.559
Yes, so it's like location,
your age ranges,

00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:24.839
the types of impairments
people identify as having,

00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:29.399
employment levels, also getting
into just internet proficiency,

00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:34.760
what they use, like if they use
a desktop or mobile devices,

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:38.212
again, even if there
are browser extensions.

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:40.639
There's a wide variety of users,

00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:45.718
that's why the image of visualizing
the diversity of individuals.

00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:48.559
It was also getting feedback.

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:51.159
For example, like multimedia, right,

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:54.479
and how users actually
prefer to digest content.

00:11:54.480 --> 00:12:01.160
Is it from transcripts
or do they prefer audio descriptions,

00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:03.119
or do they want both,

00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:06.039
so getting kind of feedback
on how people use the web.

00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:09.759
The same thing we'll talk
about a bit later, again,

00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:14.360
accessibility overlays
and users' experience using them.

00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:16.759
Then, of course, just even CAPTCHA,

00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:19.039
the thing that most people
have to deal with every single day,

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:21.079
the experiences around that,

00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:24.999
as well as just their thoughts
on the overarching improvements,

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.491
and also concerns
in the accessibility space.

00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:32.279
Yes, with the pairing with WebAIM,

00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:34.759
there are a fair amount
of questions about screen readers.

00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:37.439
That's why you've got desktop ones

00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:40.599
like NVDA and JAWS as shown in the image.

00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:42.479
You've got different proficiency levels.

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:45.279
Also mobile device use was discussed.

00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:48.039
What kind of primary input
devices they might be using,

00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:50.179
and even the consideration if they use

00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:52.799
a mouse or not when using a screen reader.

00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:56.846
Also just how they navigate
long pages and the like.

00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:01.319
Then the key thing was this survey is done

00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:04.379
in a way that you actually
say whether you use

00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:06.279
an assistive technology or not.

00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:08.039
If you don't use
that many assistive technology,

00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:09.799
the survey is actually a lot shorter.

00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:11.839
If you use multiple
forms at the same time,

00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:15.119
there's a lot of more questions
to fill out.

00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:17.599
Yes, there's many users
that might say I use a screen reader

00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:19.759
and then also have questions
because they said,

00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:22.934
yes, I also do use screen magnification.

00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:26.239
We had questions around what assistive

00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:28.679
technology is being used
for magnification,

00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:30.919
the amount of percentages
they might increase

00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:33.320
with these different types.

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:34.919
The same thing with font size enlargement,

00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:36.799
if they're using those techniques.

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:39.799
Then if there's multiple layers,
are they doing it at the same time?

00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:43.370
Are they doing
different ones or just singles?

00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:46.079
Again, just we've got magnification

00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:50.720
on the mind with
also then style adjustments.

00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:54.599
Again, same thing, people got
questions if they said, oh, yes,

00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:56.799
I actually do adjust my styles.

00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:59.139
There were then questions
around color adjustments

00:13:59.140 --> 00:14:01.319
like the high contrast image here,

00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:06.359
high contrast mode preferences,
whether websites high contrast modes,

00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:09.319
if they provided them,
they actually use them compared to just

00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:12.439
their own browser or desktop settings,

00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:15.359
whether they're people
that actually prefer dark modes,

00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:18.199
and then if they're actually
using any style extensions,

00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:23.912
so places like Stylish to actually
make adjustments to websites for them.

00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:27.519
Again, there's all
different types of inputs.

00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:30.199
So we wanted
to also understand the ways people

00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:34.200
actually put information
into their devices, right?

00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:39.719
Whether they actually use navigation
with keyboard, screen readers,

00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:42.719
also talking about external
keyboard usage for mobile devices,

00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:45.239
whether they're actually
using that or not.

00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:49.879
Other input usages,
so switch accesses, eye tracking,

00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:51.960
voice dictation usage.

00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:57.759
That's why voice dictation
like Dragon NaturallySpeaking or OptiKey,

00:14:57.760 --> 00:14:58.879
those types of things,

00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:03.279
where you could be using
more than one as well.

00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:05.279
Now there's also whether
they're actually having

00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:09.644
difficulty navigating websites
with these input devices.

00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:14.413
Then what are some of the survey results?

00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:17.719
Luckily, we don't have to cover
every single thing today

00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:20.919
because there's too much
to cover in a short period of time,

00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:23.519
but all the data is available online.

00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:26.239
This year we actually took
all the data results and put them up

00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:27.919
there to make it publicly available

00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:30.479
since the community wanted
their voices to be heard.

00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:31.799
All key findings, results,

00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:35.846
and data is available
at webaccessibilitysurvey.com.

00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:40.079
In there, there's over 100,000 cells
of data that you can sort through,

00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:42.159
look through, and get feedback.

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:44.079
There may be one or two comments

00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:47.199
that are not too happy about
Reddit because, again, we're filling out

00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:50.599
the survey at the time
of the blackout happening.

00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:52.679
The data page also allows for filtering,

00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:54.519
so you can actually search and sort.

00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:57.359
If you prefer and you want to get
like a downloaded Excel version,

00:15:57.360 --> 00:15:59.999
you can also do that as well on the site.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.639
If you do have any difficulties,
if you do have any questions,

00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:06.740
you can also reach out
to a11y@americaneagle.com.

00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:12.879
Then what are some of the results?

00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:16.039
Demographics-wise,
it's not too surprising,

00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:21.399
but a large number of users
are from North America and Europe,

00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:24.959
mostly because either A,
we can't completely be 100 percent sure,

00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:29.039
whether it's because of Reddit,
or probably a major factor is it was,

00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:33.119
again, a survey only done in English,
so probably countries

00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:36.559
like that probably have the most number
of English-speaking users,

00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:39.259
and that's why they have
a larger amount with 60.1%

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:43.000
from North America and 26.3% from Europe.

00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:46.199
Other countries including
or areas including

00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:51.879
Asia and Oceania and Central
America also have some input

00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:58.120
with Asia at 4.9% Oceania at 5.5%
and South America at 1.6%.

00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:01.119
There's lower percentages
in some of the other countries

00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:04.439
and areas like Middle East with only 0.7%

00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:08.240
Africa with 0.5%
and Central America with 0.2%.

00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:11.439
The statistical significance
may be smaller,

00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:13.199
but you might still be able to extrapolate

00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:17.564
some anecdotal information
about users from those areas.

00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:22.279
Now, we didn't force users to—

00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:24.319
They have to have a disability
or an impairment in order

00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:28.119
to actually take this survey,
and part of it is because not all users

00:17:28.120 --> 00:17:30.239
identify as having a disability.

00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:31.919
They may use assistive technology,

00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:36.284
but they actually don't identify
as having a disability.

00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:38.279
A large majority, almost 60%

00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:43.520
so 58.9% of participants
identified as having a disability.

00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:46.959
Then the types of impairments
that was kind of broken down.

00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:50.199
Yes, the math doesn't math because people

00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:54.479
can select more than one option,
so it adds up to more than 100%.

00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:58.079
A 40% of users stated
that they had cognitive

00:17:58.080 --> 00:17:59.699
or learning impairments,

00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:04.380
37% noted low vision, 24% noted blindness,

00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:06.839
18% noted motor skills,

00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:10.560
14% noted deafness or hard of hearing.

00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:16.159
Then others, like they could also just put
in whatever they wanted to add to this.

00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:18.719
There were others that put
in their medical conditions,

00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:24.119
additional features, things
like hydrocephalus and then colorblindness

00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:28.559
and neurological disorders
that they wanted to actually note.

00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:29.979
There is a large variety in there

00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:31.759
and there was writing areas for that.

00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:33.159
If you did want to look through the data,

00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:37.524
you can find individuals
who have explained their story.

00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:41.019
The key thing here
to kind of remember is that

00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:44.599
there's all types of users
that use assistive technology.

00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:47.399
Like I said,
there was about 41% of users that said,

00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:52.716
we don't identify as having a disability,
but of those 41% of users,

00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:57.485
they also noted using 9%
of them using screen readers.

00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:00.359
Maybe that they may not identify,

00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:02.979
but they actually using
that assistive technology.

00:19:02.980 --> 00:19:08.279
35.8% noted using screen magnification,
and then 31.8% of those users

00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:11.079
also noted using color
contrast adjustments.

00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:12.599
It's again to try and get ourselves

00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:15.959
to get past the assumption that assistive

00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:18.719
technology is only for someone
that is disabled,

00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:21.439
and it's like, no,
it's for all types of users

00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:24.499
because it can be beneficial
for all types--

00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:25.419
Norbert: For everyone.

00:19:25.420 --> 00:19:26.420
Nick: Yes.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:35.079
Also, maybe surprising or not surprising
to individuals on this webinar

00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:39.920
that users are finding
it difficult to navigate the web today.

00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:43.079
From users that identified
as having a disability,

00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:48.199
48% of them combined fail capture
a few times a week to every day.

00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:50.399
A lot of the questions did ask frequency,

00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:53.599
so how often did you feel
like you failed a capture?

00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:55.999
Was it all the time or was it seldom?

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.239
There was even people who said never.

00:19:58.240 --> 00:19:59.319
That would not be me.

00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:02.392
I have failed it multiple times,
but I have a few--

00:20:02.393 --> 00:20:03.599
Norbert: There's perfect people out there.

00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:05.759
Nick: Yes, there's
perfect people out there.

00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:09.799
Again, it's just to show how questions
can be interpreted differently.

00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:12.399
No data and no survey is 100% flawless,

00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:14.759
so they could have interpreted it as maybe

00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:16.799
they did it pass a couple of times,

00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:20.399
but then actually were still able
to get through in the end.

00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:22.839
They don't consider
that a failure versus others might say,

00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:24.919
oh, I didn't actually
pass the initial round,

00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:26.959
so therefore,
I must have failed the capture,

00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:29.439
even though I eventually got it.

00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:35.840
A 41% combined leave inaccessible
sites a few times a week to every day.

00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:39.979
That's a reminder again,
so people that are site owners

00:20:39.980 --> 00:20:43.039
that kind of, oh, okay,
well, if someone has a problem,

00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:47.279
they might reach out
or they might ask for feedback or,

00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:48.799
let us know we're having problems.

00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:51.719
It's like, no,
they're just going to leave.

00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:53.619
They've got other things to do.

00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:57.279
Why stick around on
a site that doesn't cater to them?

00:20:57.280 --> 00:20:59.799
That might be especially
impactful for sites

00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:03.688
that are trying to get
members or like e-commerce.

00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:07.079
Another aspect is 24%
noted that web content

00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:09.959
has become less accessible
over the past year.

00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:11.119
Again, there's percentages.

00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:14.879
A large majority just said
it hasn't really changed

00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:16.559
because things are still not great.

00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:18.399
A lot of the technology has improved,

00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:21.599
but the web itself and web
sites are still not catering

00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:24.774
well enough to people with disabilities.

00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:29.639
Some other aspects, I think
something that really is is something

00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:30.999
to highlight compared to,

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:34.839
let's say, like the WebAIM
survey is the top primary desktop

00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:38.559
screen reader results
were quite high for NVDA,

00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:42.139
so 53.7% noted NVDA

00:21:42.620 --> 00:21:46.240
as their primary versus 24.9% for JAWS.

00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:48.839
Compare that to even
this year's WebAIM survey,

00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:50.839
which still has them
fairly close together,

00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:54.840
about 40% for JAWS and about 37% for NVDA.

00:21:55.040 --> 00:21:58.799
They're fairly close together
in the WebAIM survey versus this one.

00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:00.719
Is it again because of the demographics?

00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:03.599
Is it because of the online communities

00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:05.479
and the people involved with there?

00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:07.079
It's hard to say from just the data,

00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:11.559
but it also shows us
that there's a wide variety of users.

00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:14.959
When you're looking at what you might want
to test your sites with,

00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:17.559
at least those top two,
there were additional ones.

00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:18.799
There's a lot of people who submitted

00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:21.839
even other screen
readers for their primary,

00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:24.519
but those were the two largest ones.

00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:30.679
For the top mobile screen readers,
58.5% said VoiceOver versus 37,

00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:33.079
30.7 percent said TalkBack,

00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:35.399
which is really interesting
if you look at the demographics,

00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:38.812
because actually
Android use is much higher,

00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:41.879
but it then shows that maybe
the larger demographic

00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:45.239
of users that use screen
readers actually prefer iOS,

00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:48.239
probably because VoiceOver
was one of the early on adopters

00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:50.999
of having a screen reader
built into their device,

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.279
and then others came a bit later.

00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:58.199
That could be just historical
aspect that people stick with it.

00:22:58.320 --> 00:22:59.520
All right.

00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:03.479
Then let's get into some findings.

00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:05.279
Again, all the data is available online,

00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:09.959
and that's just a sampling of lots
of questions involved with this.

00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:12.959
Norbert: Let's talk about
one of my favorite subjects,

00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:17.760
overlays, and why they are mixed bad.

00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:21.719
Some key findings in overlays.

00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:25.560
Out of 456 participants that said yes

00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:29.679
or were unsure of overlays,

00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:35.200
about 50% didn't know what overlay
they were interacting with.

00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:37.719
Out of the ones that did know,

00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:43.120
top three recognized AccessiBe,
AudioEye, and EqualWeb.

00:23:43.573 --> 00:23:50.180
54% gave an experience of 0 to 2 out of 5,

00:23:50.534 --> 00:23:55.799
30% gave an experience of 0 out of 5,

00:23:55.800 --> 00:24:00.160
and 5% gave an experience of 5 out of 5.

00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:03.479
There's some things
that people need to understand.

00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:07.800
There is positives
in good things with overlays.

00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:13.599
On one of those, let's start with okay
and great overlay experiences.

00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:17.399
Zoom options to increase
font size in certain sections.

00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:19.120
Removing animation.

00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:21.959
Providing some keyboard accessibility

00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:25.200
for users that are keyboard-only users.

00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:31.439
Now let's talk about
the poor experiences and feedback.

00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:33.239
Some things that happen.

00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:37.599
This is from not only just
from feedback from r/Blind,

00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:41.680
but also in the survey, is hijacked focus.

00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:46.040
The use of e-ink screens.

00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:50.039
For example,
users that are reading books online,

00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:53.531
the e-ink has a limited number
of grayscales.

00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:58.202
Sometimes the overlay makes
it extremely difficult to read.

00:24:59.880 --> 00:25:03.679
Some other comments is, once I realized
the screen reader is both red

00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:06.616
at the same time as my screen reader.

00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:09.959
Turning that option off was difficult.

00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:14.640
Some overlays made
the entire screen inaccessible.

00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:21.711
They had to restart their computer
due to the screen reader on the website.

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:26.520
With the overlay and the screen reader
on their desktop,

00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:32.280
blurring the communication
with both devices.

00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:34.139
Nick: Yes, and that was a writing area.

00:25:34.140 --> 00:25:38.742
There's actually some lengthier
ones just talking about it.

00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:40.359
They just completely block it.

00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:44.639
There's some that said,
no problems because I block it.

00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:46.871
A wide variety of feedback.

00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:50.879
Norbert: Yes, and I would like to go
in deeper with that.

00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:57.680
Ad blockers do, on some occasions,
block some of these overlay tools.

00:25:57.920 --> 00:26:01.319
To put that in consideration,
if you do choose an overlay,

00:26:01.320 --> 00:26:04.079
some ad blockers
are actually blocking them

00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:08.444
from the users in order
to prevent them from using them.

00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:14.800
Don't assume users.

00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:19.559
Not every user is only using
a keyboard with whatever

00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:22.999
technology they're using,
such as screen readers.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:27.319
One question on our mind that came up

00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:31.740
multiple times throughout the years was,

00:26:32.820 --> 00:26:38.119
why people do not acknowledge

00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:41.452
that there's mouse
and screen reader users?

00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:45.259
That was one of the lead questions

00:26:45.260 --> 00:26:49.119
in our survey that moved
the momentum of getting

00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:51.186
this survey put together.

00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:57.360
Screen readers users do use
mice and other input devices.

00:26:57.480 --> 00:27:00.419
45.6% use input devices

00:27:00.420 --> 00:27:03.739
other than the keyboard
as their primary input.

00:27:03.740 --> 00:27:07.806
46.9% use a mouse while using
a screen reader.

00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:11.680
Keyboard users are on mobile devices.

00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:16.240
14.6% noted they use
external keyboards on mobile.

00:27:16.420 --> 00:27:20.579
67.5% noted that keyboard navigation

00:27:20.580 --> 00:27:23.639
is also not intuitive on mobile.

00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:25.559
Nick: Yes, and so that's
why it's hard to say, right?

00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:29.399
Is it that there's a low percentage
of users that use external keyboards

00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:33.605
because it's difficult
or because they don't use them?

00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:36.239
That's where the limitations
of sometimes a survey,

00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:38.999
you don't have enough
to really say one way or the other,

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:41.719
but it is interesting to note
just the large number of users

00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:46.399
that noted having difficulties
navigating on mobile devices.

00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:49.880
Norbert: Such things as ARIA labels,

00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:55.799
and you could provide
a mouse with ARIA hidden as an example.

00:27:55.800 --> 00:28:00.319
Nick: Yes, so for like mice users,
it's actually interesting.

00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:02.279
Again, because we test a lot ourselves.

00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:04.359
We've seen a lot in the wild.

00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:06.479
One of the things that we keep seeing

00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:09.839
in the past couple years
is an increase in users that,

00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:14.399
or developers on site owners
that actually use ARIA hidden equals true.

00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:16.439
I'm sorry, I'm going to get
a little technical here.

00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:17.319
ARIA hidden equals true,

00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:21.759
which means like hide
it from screen readers on the text,

00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:23.879
so they'd be having
like text inside of an anchor,

00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:24.839
for example, and they'd be like,

00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:28.999
okay, put the text inside, but hide
the text, and then add an ARIA label.

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.159
Then the ARIA label
overwrites what the name is.

00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:35.399
It technically has a name,
but for a mouse user, for example,

00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:37.679
in NVDA, when they hover over,

00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:39.839
it actually doesn't announce
the ARIA labels.

00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:42.319
It only announced
the text that you're hovering over.

00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:44.199
Since the text technically doesn't exist,

00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:48.199
it was thrown into a nebulous void
by saying ARIA hidden equals true.

00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:51.119
They actually don't get
any information on the link.

00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:52.399
That's a dangerous practice.

00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:53.519
That's where it's kind of showing

00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:56.759
where you might want
to start considering including

00:28:56.760 --> 00:28:59.159
mouse movement
with screen readers in order

00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:02.730
to get a good sense
for your testing purposes.

00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:09.119
What is-- Oh, did you want
to say anything else?

00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:10.199
Norbert: Nope.

00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:11.520
Go ahead.

00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:15.212
Nick: Some additional
findings that we had.

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:18.959
We can only cover so much.

00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:21.639
One of the key findings
from screen readers,

00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:24.839
so just interesting tidbits to understand,

00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:28.839
is that the 22.3%
of screen reader users did

00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:31.239
not identify as having
low vision or blindness.

00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:33.719
It's a reminder to ourselves
to not always assume

00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:38.560
that someone using a screen reader
is only a blind individual.

00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:41.399
It could be someone
that's using it because of dyslexia.

00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:44.199
They could be completely
sighted and they just enjoy

00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:47.519
actually being
helpful to have it announced to you.

00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:50.519
Again, now being
in the testing space and feeling

00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:51.439
comfortable with screen readers,

00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:56.439
I've even used screen
readers to get past limitations

00:29:56.440 --> 00:30:00.839
of particular websites
that they did poor responsive view,

00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:03.239
and so there's items off screen.

00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:05.039
I can actually go
to it and actually hit submit.

00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:07.919
I actually had to do that for,
I think, a banking site once.

00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:08.759
It was just like, all right,

00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:12.079
well, it's a good thing
I have a screen reader available.

00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:14.039
Then 66% of screen reader users noted

00:30:14.040 --> 00:30:17.559
commonly navigating
by headings on long pages.

00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:21.680
In comparison,
landmarks was only about 15.2%.

00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:23.759
It's a reminder to ourselves, again,

00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:28.079
headings have been around for a long time
versus HTML5 landmarks.

00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:31.279
In relations around that,
that's only been in more recent years.

00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:33.439
It could be why a large majority of users

00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:36.679
are still used to using
headings than landmarks.

00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:40.439
Also, landmarks is still a bit wild west
in implementation,

00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:42.479
and older sites aren't going to have them.

00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:47.159
I think that's why a lot of users
use headings because they can skim

00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:50.968
the content a bit faster
than going by landmarks.

00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:56.279
It is noteworthy that the three major
blockers for reaching

00:30:56.280 --> 00:31:01.559
a website are 74.6% of users noted unclear

00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:05.359
hierarchy or organizational content,
pointing back to those headings.

00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:06.559
If you don't have good heading structures,

00:31:06.560 --> 00:31:08.439
you don't have really
good organization of content,

00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:10.199
how are they supposed to really navigate

00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:12.332
and understand what's on the page?

00:31:12.333 --> 00:31:17.113
67.4% noted unlabeled form fields,

00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:21.960
and then 66.3% incompatible
with assistive technology.

00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:26.564
Again, where the sites just
fail outright because of it.

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:32.412
Some other key findings
around other inputs.

00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:34.679
To be honest, though,

00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:38.799
the survey did have lower
percentages for switch access,

00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:43.159
eye tracking, so 5.4% for switch access,

00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:48.254
eye tracking/pointers for 5.7%
and voice dictation at 9.7% usage.

00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:53.819
Now, is it because
of the individual organizations

00:31:53.820 --> 00:31:54.699
we reached out to?

00:31:54.700 --> 00:31:56.519
Maybe they don't have as many users.

00:31:56.520 --> 00:31:58.999
It may not still be a true indication

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:02.159
on the number of users
that use these technologies,

00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:05.799
but it may not be as significant
in information

00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:08.599
and still may be anecdotal
depending on your tolerance

00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:11.245
levels for statistical analysis.

00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:16.083
It's still good to see
through what they're dealing with.

00:32:17.560 --> 00:32:21.239
Another input device that we considered
was also Braille readers.

00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:25.839
Only 18% of screen
readers respondents noted

00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:28.599
using a Braille reader
when navigating websites.

00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:31.639
What we, again,
can't determine from the survey alone

00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:35.119
is whether is that low
percentage because of literacy.

00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:40.118
Is there a literacy reduction
or is it a tech preference, right?

00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:44.279
Again, as we continue to plan
into the future is maybe we figure out

00:32:44.280 --> 00:32:49.960
more additional pointed questions
to help get clarity around these gaps.

00:32:51.280 --> 00:32:54.899
Now, do know everyone
that was using these tools

00:32:54.900 --> 00:32:58.946
noted difficulties with links
and buttons every day.

00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:00.599
They're not every user,

00:33:00.600 --> 00:33:06.379
but 19.5% of keyboard users
noted having difficulty every day,

00:33:06.380 --> 00:33:12.279
31.4% of switch access users
noted having difficulties every day,

00:33:12.280 --> 00:33:17.279
and 24.7% of pointer device users
noted having difficulty every day.

00:33:17.280 --> 00:33:19.439
Now is it because of
the technology or is it because,

00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:22.079
again, the web hasn't
really been accounting

00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:25.259
for all these different user
types in their testing practices

00:33:25.260 --> 00:33:27.739
and implementation techniques?

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:32.019
Norbert: I want to--[crosstalk]

00:33:32.020 --> 00:33:32.719
Nick: Yes, you want to-- Go ahead.

00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:33.719
No, you first. Go ahead.

00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:37.608
Norbert: Okay.
The key findings was magnification.

00:33:37.840 --> 00:33:41.331
That question
in the beginning of the survey,

00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:46.719
do you have a disability,
which sometimes wasn't checked, no.

00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:51.640
The common usage was magnification.

00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:54.927
A lot of users use magnification.

00:33:55.040 --> 00:33:59.800
From browser magnification
at 82.8% of the most three common.

00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:05.012
Browser font size
magnification was at 60.9%

00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:12.202
and operating system
magnification at 59.5% magnification.

00:34:13.720 --> 00:34:17.399
Between most common browser magnification

00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:22.020
was at 46.1% was 100% to 150%

00:34:23.020 --> 00:34:29.580
16 to 20 PX, most common font
size in large print was at 36.8%

00:34:30.283 --> 00:34:35.420
and 150% to 199% under 200

00:34:35.460 --> 00:34:39.840
is the most common
OS magnification of 61.5%.

00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:44.079
Only the lower magnification percentages

00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:46.879
are due to multiple
things being used together.

00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:51.439
It's not just users depending on just
browser magnification,

00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:53.319
but they're also using applications

00:34:53.320 --> 00:34:58.119
on the desktop or an app
to also increase the size.

00:34:58.120 --> 00:35:04.159
For example, if a user does
only like the desktop version

00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:07.199
of a website instead
of a mobile version of a website,

00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:12.240
they will choose to magnify
their desktop and not the website,

00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:15.679
and decrease that and use
it together in order

00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:19.488
to provide them
a desktop version of the website.

00:35:19.780 --> 00:35:21.220
Nick: Yes.

00:35:21.540 --> 00:35:23.519
When there used
to be separate mobile sites,

00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:24.959
right, that had its own pain points,

00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:28.879
but now that the web really has moved
towards responsive,

00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:30.616
it's the question of,

00:35:30.680 --> 00:35:34.959
there's a still a fair amount
of sites that start to reduce content,

00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:37.919
reduce interactivity,
reduce the amount of items.

00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:42.740
Because the assumption of "mobile"
users are on the go,

00:35:42.980 --> 00:35:44.919
but just because they're on a small device

00:35:44.920 --> 00:35:48.119
doesn't mean that they're necessarily
on the go, and, two,

00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:51.679
magnification users are going to end
up in a very similar viewpoint,

00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:54.079
but they might actually
still be on a desktop.

00:35:54.080 --> 00:35:58.959
That's why anecdotally
what we've come across in interacting

00:35:58.960 --> 00:36:01.079
with communities is that they noted,

00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:05.039
oh, well, it's because I like still using
the desktop version.

00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:07.559
Doing that combination
allows them to still,

00:36:07.560 --> 00:36:09.359
without having to magnify a whole bunch,

00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:11.859
doing the combination of magnification
allowed them

00:36:11.860 --> 00:36:16.560
to actually still get a desktop view
versus a "mobile view."

00:36:17.120 --> 00:36:18.959
Food for thought
when you're actually developing

00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:21.109
your websites around that.

00:36:23.160 --> 00:36:24.160
All right.

00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:28.439
All along we stated,
there are still some gaps.

00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:30.559
There's still some aspects to it.

00:36:30.560 --> 00:36:33.734
Again, we learned along the way as well.

00:36:35.580 --> 00:36:37.563
Norbert: Survey fatigue.

00:36:37.900 --> 00:36:41.135
r/Blind and many other subreddits
and other communities

00:36:41.136 --> 00:36:45.800
on Facebook do receive
a large amount of surveys.

00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:49.340
Due to some surveys,

00:36:50.380 --> 00:36:53.513
users don't usually react to them.

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:57.839
On our survey,
the average time it took to complete

00:36:57.840 --> 00:37:01.490
our survey was about
20 minutes and 38 seconds,

00:37:01.786 --> 00:37:04.679
with a completion rate of only 39%.

00:37:05.240 --> 00:37:06.920
Online communities,

00:37:09.040 --> 00:37:15.039
for r/Blind, when we made this post,
received 14.5 thousand views

00:37:15.040 --> 00:37:22.040
of the post and only 4.5 thousand
interactions, which is only 31%.

00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:29.080
Because survey fatigue,
users on these communities sometimes

00:37:29.320 --> 00:37:32.130
do not want to interact with them.

00:37:32.240 --> 00:37:34.439
Nick: Yes, and, again, because you noted,

00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:38.339
sometimes in a month,
how many surveys come into, like,

00:37:38.340 --> 00:37:40.080
r/Blind, for example?

00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:42.543
Norbert: A couple dozen.

00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:48.400
In the older version of r/Blind,

00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:51.619
sometimes our amazing
moderators had to deal

00:37:51.620 --> 00:37:55.400
with 30, 40 a month, if not more.

00:37:56.200 --> 00:38:01.319
Again, it helps to provide new technology.

00:38:01.320 --> 00:38:07.520
Also helps users
to better understand certain

00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:11.280
type of assistive technology and so forth.

00:38:12.120 --> 00:38:17.639
There's a lot of surveys
that don't have real reason behind them,

00:38:17.640 --> 00:38:20.639
and they're just questions
that's being asked,

00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:25.920
rather than some research
done before posting a survey.

00:38:27.260 --> 00:38:31.080
Nick: Yes, and note
about the length in time.

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:34.679
What's interesting is, for example,
right, and it's all data,

00:38:34.680 --> 00:38:37.490
so we can only do so much with it.

00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:40.239
The average was also really skewed
a little bit,

00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:43.334
because some users would leave it open.

00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:47.039
Now the question is, again,
because we're not there,

00:38:47.040 --> 00:38:48.459
I think we saw ones where it was, like,

00:38:48.460 --> 00:38:50.342
24 hours or something like that,
and it's, like,

00:38:50.343 --> 00:38:54.119
was it a difficulty for that long,
or did they just kind of leave it open?

00:38:54.120 --> 00:38:55.310
Hard to say.

00:38:55.800 --> 00:39:00.719
There were a fair amount
that were still in 10 minutes or less,

00:39:01.040 --> 00:39:03.719
but it also depended on how many questions
they had to fill out.

00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:06.439
Since there was logic around, okay, yes,

00:39:06.440 --> 00:39:08.079
if you used all that assistive technology,

00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:09.599
you ended up with a lot more questions

00:39:09.600 --> 00:39:12.932
than if you didn't really use much at all.

00:39:14.480 --> 00:39:17.879
Yes, there was also
platform limitations, right?

00:39:17.880 --> 00:39:19.779
When we were looking
through the different tools,

00:39:19.780 --> 00:39:22.139
Typeform stood out to us

00:39:22.140 --> 00:39:25.759
for some of the logic that we needed
and some of the setup.

00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:29.759
We actually did involve moderators
from the different communities,

00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:34.679
from, like, r/Blind and whatnot,
to actually take a look as well.

00:39:34.680 --> 00:39:38.399
Again, we tested, but just also get
other users' experience to say,

00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:40.679
like, okay, what's the impact?

00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:43.695
Will people have difficulties with it?

00:39:44.040 --> 00:39:47.359
They noted limited impact
when they ran through it,

00:39:47.360 --> 00:39:49.599
but the tool is also constantly changing,

00:39:49.600 --> 00:39:51.919
just like all of the ones online.

00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:53.759
There did end up being some complications,

00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:57.079
but we were able to work
around those limitations,

00:39:57.080 --> 00:39:59.879
like radio buttons,
in particular questions.

00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:02.277
If they had too many options,

00:40:02.720 --> 00:40:07.239
some Android users with TalkBack
couldn't fill it out correctly,

00:40:07.240 --> 00:40:09.719
and so then we made
adjustments to make it into,

00:40:09.720 --> 00:40:14.799
from initial feedback, it was, okay,
we'll make this a multiple choice

00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:17.700
rather than a radio box at the time.

00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:26.332
Then there were
question limitations, right?

00:40:28.440 --> 00:40:29.999
There was even feedback to say, like,

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:33.599
sometimes when they say yes,
that they did want to answer

00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:35.319
questions about the system technology.

00:40:35.320 --> 00:40:37.399
Once they started getting into it,
they're like, actually,

00:40:37.400 --> 00:40:40.559
it's not exactly
what I was thinking it would be.

00:40:40.560 --> 00:40:42.959
They could have backed out,
but maybe it wasn't clear enough

00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:45.639
that they can also back
out and make those changes.

00:40:45.640 --> 00:40:47.559
There were instances where sometimes

00:40:47.560 --> 00:40:51.439
they wanted a not applicable or a none,
but it wasn't available.

00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:54.259
In future iterations,
we'll probably include

00:40:54.260 --> 00:40:56.839
some options for that or make it clearer

00:40:56.840 --> 00:40:58.459
on what they're going to be going into

00:40:58.460 --> 00:41:01.353
for questions or backing out of it.

00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:04.919
Some of them just end up
with lots of questions, right?

00:41:04.920 --> 00:41:10.400
To be agnostic of software,
we had to have 20, 30 options,

00:41:10.480 --> 00:41:13.799
and listing them
all can be quite large as well.

00:41:13.800 --> 00:41:17.608
Trying to find that balance,
we even omitted one,

00:41:18.993 --> 00:41:21.299
a couple of items,
and maybe we should have kept it in

00:41:21.300 --> 00:41:25.319
because that may influence
what the user feedback is, right?

00:41:25.320 --> 00:41:26.759
Because if they don't immediately see it,

00:41:26.760 --> 00:41:30.489
they may not actually then list
it as an option.

00:41:31.320 --> 00:41:34.519
Then there was also Typeform short
answers made

00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:37.559
questions more difficult due
to single line inputs,

00:41:37.560 --> 00:41:41.289
but long answers
also had their own limitations.

00:41:41.960 --> 00:41:44.159
Some users noted,
again, it's a small input

00:41:44.160 --> 00:41:46.440
versus a longer text area.

00:41:46.760 --> 00:41:50.179
It was, again,
compromising due to the limitations

00:41:50.180 --> 00:41:52.329
within the Typeform setup.

00:41:53.400 --> 00:41:55.080
Yes, so what's next?

00:41:56.080 --> 00:41:59.559
We're going to continue
to add findings, publications.

00:41:59.560 --> 00:42:03.279
If you use any of this data
and you publish anything, reach out.

00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:05.239
You can contact us online.

00:42:05.240 --> 00:42:08.620
Reach out at a11y@americaneagle.com.

00:42:08.660 --> 00:42:09.879
We'd be happy to post.

00:42:09.880 --> 00:42:11.119
We have a publications area.

00:42:11.120 --> 00:42:13.459
We can put your information in there

00:42:13.460 --> 00:42:14.879
to help spread the word because, again,

00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:18.486
this is all just to help all end
users better understand

00:42:18.487 --> 00:42:22.839
and site owners understand
how to make the web a better place.

00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:25.799
Again, we're also connecting
with different survey makers, right?

00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:30.039
Continue to work with WebAIM
and other ones out there to, again,

00:42:30.040 --> 00:42:33.479
when does it make sense
to still have a separate one?

00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:35.639
Then we're comparing additional tools,

00:42:35.640 --> 00:42:38.879
looking at places like accessible surveys.

00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:43.319
We're working with other organizations
and online communities to see

00:42:43.320 --> 00:42:46.573
if we can also broaden the participation.

00:42:46.880 --> 00:42:52.037
Yes, we're planning for the next release
of surveys in early 2025.

00:42:53.320 --> 00:42:54.399
All right.

00:42:54.400 --> 00:42:57.970
It looks like we've got
some questions so far.

00:42:58.680 --> 00:43:01.799
Jessica: I can go ahead
and moderate those questions for you.

00:43:01.800 --> 00:43:03.387
Nick: Thank you.

00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:06.320
Jessica: Thank you.

00:43:06.400 --> 00:43:08.999
I'll read the first one,
the earliest one that came in.

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:14.078
I want to thank you for this amazing
presentation on your survey.

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:17.519
I have questions as well if we have time.

00:43:17.520 --> 00:43:18.520
Nick: Yes.

00:43:18.640 --> 00:43:21.399
Jessica: Our first one from audience,

00:43:21.400 --> 00:43:24.239
what do you say to people
who see this clear data

00:43:24.240 --> 00:43:27.799
and disregard
it for the sake of their aesthetic anyway?

00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:31.960
Do you have a diplomatic
go-to response for this?

00:43:34.200 --> 00:43:35.200
Nick: Yes.

00:43:37.170 --> 00:43:44.159
Generally speaking, I feel
like with e-commerce and some site owners

00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:46.799
that are in for a financial gain
in some way,

00:43:46.800 --> 00:43:49.879
the data itself,
a lot of them are data driven.

00:43:49.880 --> 00:43:52.199
We have not generally seen them shy away

00:43:52.200 --> 00:43:54.119
from that because actually
that information,

00:43:54.120 --> 00:43:56.039
if anything, helps guide them.

00:43:56.040 --> 00:44:00.120
Because conversions
equal against financial gain.

00:44:01.880 --> 00:44:04.679
When you talk about
how do you get people to be interested

00:44:04.680 --> 00:44:06.439
in accessibility and you would hope

00:44:06.440 --> 00:44:09.559
it would be just the ideal, like,
you would want to do this.

00:44:09.560 --> 00:44:11.919
You care about others, right?

00:44:11.920 --> 00:44:13.439
Then businesses, at the end of the day,

00:44:13.440 --> 00:44:16.319
they also have to keep the lights on.

00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:20.039
A lot of times when I'm discussing
things with clients and,

00:44:20.040 --> 00:44:26.520
again, out there,
I just treat it as find selfish reasons.

00:44:27.680 --> 00:44:29.319
Showing that data usually gives them

00:44:29.320 --> 00:44:32.560
selfish reasons to move forward with it.

00:44:32.840 --> 00:44:36.559
Designers now, if they're like,
but I like this look and feel,

00:44:36.560 --> 00:44:38.679
you can kind of see it in the web as well.

00:44:38.680 --> 00:44:42.239
If you look at like Web 2.0
and it was Wild West and everyone made

00:44:42.240 --> 00:44:44.719
their own interfaces
that were highly decorative

00:44:44.720 --> 00:44:49.199
and all over the place,
and then you see this shift over time,

00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:54.278
more simplified views,
much more about getting those conversions.

00:44:55.080 --> 00:44:59.119
As we focus on that, I feel
like a lot of designers that are designing

00:44:59.120 --> 00:45:02.799
for the web that are part
of companies and whatnot,

00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:04.559
they probably don't have as much weight

00:45:04.560 --> 00:45:07.279
nowadays in that aesthetic argument,

00:45:07.280 --> 00:45:09.359
because if you've got the data to show,

00:45:09.360 --> 00:45:12.279
you're going to have a large number
of users leaving your site.

00:45:12.280 --> 00:45:15.999
You're going to actually
decrease your conversions,

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:19.199
can often really help
put them in their place.

00:45:19.200 --> 00:45:23.399
Norbert: Yes, and keep in mind,
40% said they don't have a disability,

00:45:23.400 --> 00:45:26.840
so you're going
to make that judgment call?

00:45:26.920 --> 00:45:29.259
Nick: Yes, it's like, oh, well, again,

00:45:29.260 --> 00:45:33.239
we're at the website for superhumans
that have no flaws whatsoever.

00:45:33.240 --> 00:45:36.000
It's like, well, are you sure?

00:45:36.360 --> 00:45:39.119
Are you sure that they might
still not want to be able to use

00:45:39.120 --> 00:45:43.642
the assistive technology
when they're accessing your site?

00:45:45.360 --> 00:45:47.639
I guess it's not really
a diplomatic answer

00:45:47.640 --> 00:45:52.319
on how to push back in other data,
but along the lines

00:45:52.320 --> 00:45:54.119
of we haven't really seen that much

00:45:54.120 --> 00:45:57.679
pushback when we start
talking with clients about it.

00:45:57.680 --> 00:46:00.839
Hopefully, the main thing you would learn
from is find selfish reasons,

00:46:00.840 --> 00:46:06.039
and once you find the selfish reasons,
usually people will get on board.

00:46:06.040 --> 00:46:09.214
Jessica: I like that point that you said

00:46:09.600 --> 00:46:15.599
to make it data-driven numbers
and find the reason,

00:46:15.600 --> 00:46:19.239
even though the boss is going to kick
back for something.

00:46:19.240 --> 00:46:23.199
I'm going to move
on to our next audience question.

00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:27.479
It says, given
the general negative view of overlays,

00:46:27.480 --> 00:46:29.079
outside of adding an overlay,

00:46:29.080 --> 00:46:31.559
are there any positive aspects
that were noted

00:46:31.560 --> 00:46:36.400
that you would think
should be implemented in sites?

00:46:36.600 --> 00:46:42.759
Norbert: It's one that was that stood
out for a diversity of reasons.

00:46:42.760 --> 00:46:47.559
Overlay tools,
like putting a line, a ruler,

00:46:47.560 --> 00:46:52.439
providing a ruler for long content
pages such as blogs,

00:46:52.440 --> 00:46:53.679
is extremely helpful.

00:46:53.680 --> 00:46:56.039
Highlighting is extremely helpful.

00:46:56.040 --> 00:47:01.680
These tools are very helpful in making
a site more usable.

00:47:02.080 --> 00:47:06.880
Another one that helped
a lot was larger fonts.

00:47:09.280 --> 00:47:12.600
One for stop motion, for example.

00:47:12.840 --> 00:47:15.075
Again, there's tools within overlays

00:47:15.076 --> 00:47:18.599
that are very helpful and could provide

00:47:18.600 --> 00:47:22.239
essential elements
to any site if you just add them

00:47:22.240 --> 00:47:26.640
into a site as an option and provide
that feedback.

00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:28.919
Nick: If you look
at a lot of the positive versus negatives,

00:47:28.920 --> 00:47:31.199
a lot of the positive responses
were just focusing

00:47:31.200 --> 00:47:34.979
on the personalization options
that overlays provide.

00:47:34.980 --> 00:47:37.999
Again, if someone needs
this every single day,

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:41.079
they probably are already
going to use an extension or software

00:47:41.080 --> 00:47:43.499
to already provide
this and may not really rely

00:47:43.500 --> 00:47:44.879
on the overlay alone.

00:47:44.880 --> 00:47:47.179
As developers,
do you feel like you have to build

00:47:47.180 --> 00:47:48.599
the whole entire suite for them?

00:47:48.600 --> 00:47:50.319
Maybe not, but there could be users

00:47:50.320 --> 00:47:53.652
that might appreciate
that personalization.

00:47:54.760 --> 00:47:57.479
The positive side that a lot of people
focus on is more about

00:47:57.480 --> 00:48:02.480
that personalization aspect
of it and user settings.

00:48:02.680 --> 00:48:05.199
A lot of the negativity that we saw

00:48:05.200 --> 00:48:09.039
from the data was really
a lot around the automation.

00:48:09.040 --> 00:48:11.919
If there was a lot of remediation
that was coming from them,

00:48:11.920 --> 00:48:14.999
that's where things were starting
to go wrong versus the,

00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:16.719
oh, I can change my font styles.

00:48:16.720 --> 00:48:19.365
Now, that's not to say everyone,

00:48:19.400 --> 00:48:21.359
but if you're looking
at it from a high level,

00:48:21.360 --> 00:48:23.999
that's where the pain points
were starting to come

00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:27.967
in from the negative side
versus the positive side.

00:48:30.720 --> 00:48:33.159
There are overlays
that are just simply that, like,

00:48:33.160 --> 00:48:35.599
oh, maybe you want
to change a couple of font sizes.

00:48:35.600 --> 00:48:38.279
Maybe you want to have a dark mode.

00:48:38.280 --> 00:48:40.279
Again, I would look at it that way.

00:48:40.280 --> 00:48:43.159
It's like rather than doing
something generalized,

00:48:43.160 --> 00:48:45.119
though, as site owners
and site developers,

00:48:45.120 --> 00:48:48.599
you might want
to make your own branded versions of that.

00:48:48.600 --> 00:48:50.759
If anything,
it's an opportunity for you to build

00:48:50.760 --> 00:48:53.519
your own system rather
than relying on a font size

00:48:53.520 --> 00:48:55.839
adjuster that maybe
isn't really accounting

00:48:55.840 --> 00:48:58.319
for your site and your styles.

00:49:00.640 --> 00:49:01.879
Jessica: Thank you.

00:49:01.880 --> 00:49:04.919
I've got another one from the audience.

00:49:04.920 --> 00:49:07.439
If you had to choose
a single portion of your data results

00:49:07.440 --> 00:49:12.994
to highlight as the most significant
and impactful, what would that be?

00:49:16.400 --> 00:49:22.760
Norbert: For me,
as I pointed out in an earlier slide,

00:49:24.120 --> 00:49:27.079
that a lot of users depend on multiple

00:49:27.080 --> 00:49:31.320
things on your site
that are related to A11y,

00:49:31.360 --> 00:49:34.119
and to keep that in mind
when you're building

00:49:34.120 --> 00:49:39.240
any website or any system like this,
like a website,

00:49:39.520 --> 00:49:45.319
that there's all types of users
that you wouldn't know

00:49:45.320 --> 00:49:48.839
that would be using
your site in a certain way,

00:49:48.840 --> 00:49:51.319
and just to keep that in mind.

00:49:52.200 --> 00:49:58.240
That blew me away because a lot of users
chose, they're not disabled,

00:49:58.560 --> 00:50:04.200
but use tools that are made
for the disabled users.

00:50:05.640 --> 00:50:07.920
Magnification is one.

00:50:07.966 --> 00:50:09.840
Color contrast is one.

00:50:10.134 --> 00:50:11.599
Closed caption is one.

00:50:11.600 --> 00:50:17.559
Multiple things that layer
on top of layer of tools

00:50:17.560 --> 00:50:22.021
that helped accessibility
in the last 10 years,

00:50:22.022 --> 00:50:24.719
15 years are being used by everyone,

00:50:24.720 --> 00:50:28.846
not just a certain type
of user that one would think.

00:50:28.920 --> 00:50:34.077
That's a great thing that I pulled
out of this survey that helped.

00:50:34.720 --> 00:50:39.239
Nick: Yes. I would just say, again,
as developers, it just, again,

00:50:39.240 --> 00:50:40.919
helping break those myths.

00:50:40.920 --> 00:50:42.479
A couple of those things where it's,

00:50:42.480 --> 00:50:45.639
again, the types of users,
what they're interacting with,

00:50:45.640 --> 00:50:48.999
being able to reinforce
our own anecdotal aspects.

00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:53.719
For us personally, it was things like,
yes, they do use a mouse, right?

00:50:53.720 --> 00:50:55.879
Norbert: See? Told you. [chuckles]

00:50:55.880 --> 00:50:56.879
Jessica: We're out of time.

00:50:56.880 --> 00:50:58.359
Nick: We're out of time.
I know we're out of time,

00:50:58.360 --> 00:51:01.879
but thank you for all the questions
and thank you for the time today.

00:51:01.880 --> 00:51:02.839
Norbert: Thank you.

00:51:02.840 --> 00:51:09.240
Jessica: As our captioners take a break,
we'll be back at the top of the hour.

00:51:09.960 --> 00:51:14.440
Thank you very much
for hanging out with us.

00:51:14.520 --> 00:51:16.760
Oh, yes, I have a script.

00:51:19.560 --> 00:51:20.539
