00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:03.570
<v Announcer> WordPress
Accessibility Day 2024.

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.416
How to remediate accessibility issues
in WordPress,

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:10.836
with speaker Cam Coulter,
Digital Access Specialist

00:00:10.837 --> 00:00:12.500
at Santa Clara University.

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:16.717
This presentation
was recorded October 2024.

00:00:19.372 --> 00:00:20.416
<v Laura Adamonis> Hi, everyone.

00:00:20.417 --> 00:00:21.682
We're back.

00:00:22.761 --> 00:00:23.761
How's it going?

00:00:24.665 --> 00:00:27.715
It's awesome that you are all here,
and we're going to get started

00:00:27.716 --> 00:00:29.179
with our next session.

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:33.412
Welcome
to WordPress Accessibility Day 2024.

00:00:34.895 --> 00:00:37.745
My name is Laura,
and I'm your emcee for this talk.

00:00:38.467 --> 00:00:44.399
Thank you for joining us
for how to remediate accessibility issues

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.428
in WordPress, with Cam Coulter.

00:00:47.016 --> 00:00:48.494
Cam Coulter is a writer

00:00:48.495 --> 00:00:51.179
and accessibility nerd,
among other things,

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.850
who thinks incessantly
about ethical technology,

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:00.810
speculative fiction,
and intentional community.

00:01:01.349 --> 00:01:05.669
They are certified professional
in web accessibility and work

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.540
at Santa Clara University
as a digital access specialist.

00:01:10.199 --> 00:01:13.679
They have previously worked
as an accessibility consultant

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.249
at Level Access
and as a training specialist

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.240
at Hope Services,
a large nonprofit organization

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:23.399
in the San Francisco Bay Area,

00:01:23.579 --> 00:01:26.489
serving persons
with developmental disabilities

00:01:26.639 --> 00:01:28.289
and mental health needs.

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.665
Please feel free to add
your questions in the Zoom Q&amp;A

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.289
at the bottom of your screen,
and we'll answer them

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.789
at the end of the session.

00:01:36.209 --> 00:01:39.060
Use the chat to connect
with other attendees.

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:40.679
Please welcome Cam.

00:01:43.589 --> 00:01:44.939
<v Cam Coulter> Thank you,
Laura, and thank you,

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:46.180
everyone, for joining us today.

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:49.680
As Laura said, I am Cam Coulter.

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.608
I use they/them pronouns,
and I am a certified professional

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:56.744
in web accessibility through
the International Association

00:01:56.745 --> 00:01:58.770
of Accessibility Professionals.

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.750
I currently work at Santa Clara University
as a digital access specialist,

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.640
and this is actually a new role for me.

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:08.610
Until recently,
I was working at Level Access

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:10.420
as an accessibility consultant.

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.828
In that role, I tested a ton of websites
for conformance

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:19.503
with the Web Content
Accessibility Guidelines,

00:02:19.504 --> 00:02:22.672
and I would identify and report
accessibility issues

00:02:23.717 --> 00:02:28.289
and then work with our clients
to fix or remediate those issues.

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:32.699
Remediating is just
a fancy way of saying fixing things,

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.309
so they're, for the most part,
interchangeable,

00:02:36.693 --> 00:02:38.640
and that's what we're talking about today.

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:40.920
When I would work with clients

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:44.609
to report and help them fix issues,

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.450
in my last role, I usually did
that at the level of HTML,

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:51.390
CSS, and JavaScript because one,

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:56.609
that's ultimately where the issues need
to be fixed in order for the impact

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.709
to be appreciated by people
with disabilities.

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:00.220
Two,

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:07.091
I often didn't know how exactly
a website was coded on the backend,

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.628
what framework or content
management systems they were using.

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:14.699
HTML-level recommendations
are general enough that they'll work

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.250
for everyone, more or less.

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:21.269
However, if you use WordPress,

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.950
code-level recommendations
may not be that useful to you.

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:30.030
In WordPress, your website
is generated by combining together

00:03:30.059 --> 00:03:31.950
a lot of different pieces,

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.929
and fixing accessibility issues
in WordPress may not be as simple as edit

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:38.579
this one line of code here.

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:42.178
That's a reason
a lot of us like to use WordPress,

00:03:42.179 --> 00:03:46.919
right? It has a graphical user interface,
and you can easily make a website

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.870
without needing to write
every line of code,

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.970
but that does leave open the question,
how do you fix or remediate

00:03:54.059 --> 00:03:56.099
accessibility issues in WordPress?

00:03:57.359 --> 00:03:59.008
That's what we're going
to talk about for this hour.

00:03:59.009 --> 00:04:00.640
I'm going to share my screen here.

00:04:00.944 --> 00:04:10.831
[silence]

00:04:10.832 --> 00:04:13.289
Cool. I believe you should be able
to see my screen now.

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:17.549
That's our topic today, how to fix
or remediate accessibility issues

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:18.600
in WordPress.

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:26.519
This talk is for you if you are
a WordPress site owner who knows

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.270
a little bit about digital accessibility,
and you're looking to fix

00:04:30.299 --> 00:04:33.810
accessibility issues on your site
that you've identified,

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.409
or maybe that were identified
by a third party in a recent audit.

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:41.010
This site is also
for accessibility testers and consultants

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:44.167
who might be those third parties
auditing or testing

00:04:44.549 --> 00:04:45.549
other websites,

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:50.940
and who specifically want to be able
to give WordPress specific recommendations

00:04:50.969 --> 00:04:52.170
when they flag issues.

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:55.318
This talk is also
for designers, developers,

00:04:55.319 --> 00:04:57.960
and content creators
who are working in WordPress,

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:01.109
who may have identified issues
on the sites that they're working

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:03.269
on and need to fix those issues.

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:08.879
I should note that this is, I would think
of as an intermediate level talk.

00:05:09.839 --> 00:05:11.599
You do not need to be an expert.

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:14.849
We are not going to dive
into too many technical details,

00:05:15.209 --> 00:05:19.619
but I will assume that you have
a basic understanding of WordPress

00:05:20.039 --> 00:05:23.463
and a general understanding
of digital accessibility,

00:05:23.464 --> 00:05:27.419
and that you know about some common types
of accessibility issues.

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:31.139
We won't have time to explain those
in as much detail as if we would

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:34.649
in another context,
so that's where we're coming from.

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:38.020
Learning goals.

00:05:38.279 --> 00:05:39.780
By the end of this hour together,

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:43.440
it is my goal
that you will be able to identify

00:05:43.469 --> 00:05:47.850
the likely source of an accessibility
issue on a WordPress site.

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:53.309
I hope that you will be able to remediate
page-level accessibility issues,

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:57.059
such as implicit headings,
insufficient color contrast,

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:59.760
and images with improper alt text.

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:06.599
I hope that you will be able to determine
how to approach remediating plugin-level

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:08.040
or theme-level issues.

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:11.219
Those ones can be more complicated,
so by the end of our talk today,

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:15.450
you might not feel totally like you know
how to do it exactly,

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:18.239
but you should have a sense of,
"All right, this is how I can go about it.

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:19.520
This is how I would get started.

00:06:19.559 --> 00:06:20.974
This is how I could approach it."

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:29.610
The main parts of a WordPress site,
I would say,

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:30.869
are WordPress core,

00:06:31.379 --> 00:06:35.009
your theme and any customizations
that you've installed to it,

00:06:35.789 --> 00:06:37.470
any plugins that you've installed,

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:41.340
your pages and your posts,
and your media library.

00:06:41.759 --> 00:06:44.728
The media library typically is
a collection of photos

00:06:44.729 --> 00:06:47.218
on your WordPress site,
but it can include other things as well,

00:06:47.219 --> 00:06:49.200
such as documents or videos.

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:53.699
Now, to fix an accessibility issue
in WordPress,

00:06:54.059 --> 00:06:58.140
you need to start by identifying
where exactly the issue comes from.

00:06:58.979 --> 00:07:00.570
Is it specific to your theme?

00:07:00.599 --> 00:07:02.850
Is it a problem with your theme
and how you've set it up,

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:06.089
or is it maybe specific
to a plugin you're using,

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:09.659
or is it just
a page-level issue, for example?

00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:15.182
We're going to go
through these categories one by one.

00:07:15.183 --> 00:07:17.428
We're going to focus on pages,
and then plugins,

00:07:17.429 --> 00:07:18.429
and then themes.

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:21.329
We'll talk about what types
of issues you can expect

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:24.420
to find at each level
and how to go about fixing them.

00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:27.929
For this presentation,

00:07:28.079 --> 00:07:31.440
I'm going to focus on classic themes
instead of block themes,

00:07:32.039 --> 00:07:35.010
but some of what we talk about
will apply to those ones as well.

00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:39.569
I should note
that it won't always be perfectly clear

00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:43.019
at first where exactly an issue
comes from on a WordPress site,

00:07:43.379 --> 00:07:47.159
but we can make informed guesses,
and if you're an admin,

00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:50.430
you can log into that admin dashboard,
the back end,

00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:53.758
and poke around to figure out
where exactly an issue comes

00:07:53.759 --> 00:07:55.139
from and how to fix it.

00:07:56.790 --> 00:07:59.746
Here, I'll also note that if you're
a third-party consultant who's testing

00:07:59.849 --> 00:08:01.946
a site or even just testing your own site,

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:06.419
when you report accessibility issues
on a WordPress site,

00:08:06.659 --> 00:08:07.659
I'd recommend

00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:10.084
that you include a likely source field

00:08:10.085 --> 00:08:12.840
so that for each accessibility issue
you flag,

00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:16.439
I think it can be helpful to note
where you think the issue is coming from.

00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:19.258
For example,
is it something you see repeated

00:08:19.259 --> 00:08:20.460
across multiple pages?

00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:23.220
In that case, it might be
a theme-level issue,

00:08:23.789 --> 00:08:27.089
but if the issue looks like it's specific
just to this one blog post,

00:08:27.359 --> 00:08:29.909
it might be a post or a page-level issue.

00:08:31.709 --> 00:08:34.109
If you want to go above and beyond,
you could maybe even get

00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:36.840
a list of the plugins
that are used on a site,

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:41.369
and then take a guess as to which plugin
might be causing the issue,

00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:42.930
if you think it's a plugin-level issue.

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:48.510
For example, if there's a plugin
that is installed for tabs or accordions,

00:08:48.539 --> 00:08:50.578
and you notice there's an issue
with tabs or accordions,

00:08:50.579 --> 00:08:52.109
it might be specific to that plugin.

00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:58.169
Now, if you're a site owner and you have
your accessibility issues sorted by type

00:08:58.170 --> 00:08:59.170
in this way,

00:08:59.459 --> 00:09:02.459
it might be able to help you speed
things along when you're trying

00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:05.159
to fix them. For example,
you can take all of your issues

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:07.859
that look like they're related
to your theme and then send it

00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:10.680
to your theme developer
to work on fixing them,

00:09:11.010 --> 00:09:13.919
but if you have a lot of issues
that are really page-level issues,

00:09:14.459 --> 00:09:16.978
you can probably have
your content creators fix most of those

00:09:16.979 --> 00:09:21.088
because those are things
that content creators should be able

00:09:21.089 --> 00:09:23.249
to fix and should know
about when they're creating

00:09:23.279 --> 00:09:24.960
additional content for your site.

00:09:27.869 --> 00:09:30.299
With all that,
let's really dive into it and talk

00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:33.930
about page-level accessibility issues
you might find on a WordPress site.

00:09:39.149 --> 00:09:41.340
Page-level issues may include

00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:44.310
implicit or unnecessary headings.

00:09:45.118 --> 00:09:47.909
That means you have a heading
that is logically a heading,

00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:50.100
but it isn't programmatically marked
as such,

00:09:50.459 --> 00:09:51.479
or maybe the opposite,

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:53.579
you have something
that is not logically a heading,

00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:55.410
but you've actually tagged it
as a heading.

00:09:56.550 --> 00:09:59.249
Related, another page-level issue
might be implicit list,

00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:02.219
which is you have a list,
but it isn't programmatically marked

00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:03.220
as a list.

00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:06.750
These issues are important
for screen reader users mostly

00:10:06.779 --> 00:10:10.108
because they can navigate your page
by jumping to headings or jumping

00:10:10.109 --> 00:10:11.109
to list items.

00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:12.593
Also, if you don't have

00:10:12.869 --> 00:10:15.371
a heading tagged as a heading,
it might be confusing to a user

00:10:15.372 --> 00:10:17.590
who doesn't realize
that it's a heading for a section.

00:10:19.282 --> 00:10:22.929
Other page-level issues could include
insufficient color contrast,

00:10:23.529 --> 00:10:25.869
but just for particular blocks of text.

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:28.869
Sometimes color contrast issues
are theme-level issues.

00:10:28.870 --> 00:10:31.899
If you see it
across multiple pages on your site,

00:10:32.110 --> 00:10:33.999
or if you see it,
for example, in your footer,

00:10:34.329 --> 00:10:36.310
that's probably more
of a theme-level issue,

00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:38.348
but if it's just
a particular block of text

00:10:38.349 --> 00:10:41.649
on one particular page,
that's probably a page-level issue.

00:10:42.963 --> 00:10:47.228
Another page-level issue could be images
on that page that are missing

00:10:47.229 --> 00:10:50.559
alternative text or that have
inappropriate alt text.

00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:56.499
I'm going to switch
over from my PowerPoint here

00:10:57.220 --> 00:10:59.919
to an actual WordPress site,
and we're going to look

00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:02.200
at some specific page-level issues.

00:11:03.729 --> 00:11:07.269
I'm going to scroll down this page,
and I want you to think about what

00:11:07.270 --> 00:11:11.350
are some types of issues
that either you spot or that you think,

00:11:11.710 --> 00:11:13.990
"Hey, I think that might be
a page-level issue.

00:11:14.469 --> 00:11:16.330
That's something I'd want
to investigate more."

00:11:18.039 --> 00:11:20.103
I'm going
to give you about 30 seconds for that.

00:11:54.461 --> 00:11:58.270
<v Cam> All right. I'm going to briefly go
over the page-level issues on this page.

00:11:58.479 --> 00:12:01.330
First up, you may have noticed
we have some text here

00:12:01.510 --> 00:12:03.309
that has very low color contrast.

00:12:04.239 --> 00:12:06.580
It's a light gray text
against a white background.

00:12:06.939 --> 00:12:09.866
You might not have even noticed it
because it's quite hard to see.

00:12:09.867 --> 00:12:11.827
I'm going to highlight it here
in case that helps.

00:12:11.952 --> 00:12:14.258
It says, "These black beans
are so delicious and easy to make.

00:12:14.259 --> 00:12:15.490
You're going to love them."

00:12:15.491 --> 00:12:18.695
This is a page-type issue.
It's a recipe,

00:12:20.590 --> 00:12:21.938
so that's one page-level issue.

00:12:21.939 --> 00:12:24.160
This text has very bad color contrast.

00:12:24.639 --> 00:12:27.040
Right below that, we have
an image of black beans,

00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:29.649
and I'm going to go ahead
and inspect this element.

00:12:32.679 --> 00:12:37.149
You can see that over here
in the accessibility pane within DevTools,

00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:41.799
it says, "Image has empty alt text,"
which is not something you would want.

00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:45.428
This is a page for a recipe,

00:12:45.429 --> 00:12:48.700
so you probably want to be able to know
what the food actually looks like.

00:12:49.450 --> 00:12:51.951
In this case, I think we want
to make sure that image has alt text.

00:12:51.952 --> 00:12:53.980
so that's another page-level issue here.

00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:56.439
Then just below that,

00:12:56.440 --> 00:13:00.069
we have the heading ingredients,
which proceeds a list of ingredients.

00:13:01.029 --> 00:13:02.200
When I inspect this,

00:13:05.019 --> 00:13:08.258
you'll see that this is just
a paragraph element with a strong element

00:13:08.259 --> 00:13:09.259
nested inside of it.

00:13:09.430 --> 00:13:12.379
It is not programmatically
or logically a heading,

00:13:12.854 --> 00:13:14.258
so that's an issue as well.

00:13:14.259 --> 00:13:17.229
Again, for screen reader users,
they won't know that it's a heading,

00:13:17.259 --> 00:13:19.450
and it'll be harder for them
to navigate the page.

00:13:21.189 --> 00:13:22.569
How do we go about fixing these?

00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:26.844
Let me check my notes.

00:13:28.649 --> 00:13:31.157
Cool, yes.
To fix a page-level issue,

00:13:32.409 --> 00:13:35.469
you can come to the WordPress backend,
the admin dashboard,

00:13:35.770 --> 00:13:37.658
and then you're going to want
to navigate to that page.

00:13:37.659 --> 00:13:39.219
In this case, I'm going to go to Pages,

00:13:39.729 --> 00:13:40.729
All pages,

00:13:41.919 --> 00:13:43.773
and then I'll select the page title.

00:13:44.742 --> 00:13:47.229
That'll take me
to the WordPress block editor

00:13:47.230 --> 00:13:48.447
for this page.

00:13:50.919 --> 00:13:54.569
The way you fix most page-level issues
is through the WordPress block editor.

00:13:54.570 --> 00:13:58.236
For example, I'm going to navigate
to this block of text that has

00:13:58.237 --> 00:13:59.638
a very low color contrast.

00:14:01.158 --> 00:14:04.239
Then over here
on the right side of my screen,

00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:08.799
you'll see that there's a pane
for the current block that's selected,

00:14:09.190 --> 00:14:10.899
a little tab control there.

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:12.880
Right below that,
it says it's a paragraph.

00:14:13.299 --> 00:14:16.413
Then there's a section for color,
for the text color of this block.

00:14:17.097 --> 00:14:20.293
You'll actually see WordPress
will usually warn you if text has

00:14:20.295 --> 00:14:22.330
insufficient color contrast,
which is great.

00:14:22.839 --> 00:14:26.739
Here it says, "This color combination
may be hard for people to read.

00:14:27.070 --> 00:14:30.669
Try using
a brighter background color and/or

00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:32.229
a darker text color."

00:14:34.329 --> 00:14:38.230
That's one notice that this actually
is a problem, which is great.

00:14:38.650 --> 00:14:44.799
To change this, I'll just select
the text color here, sorry, one sec,

00:14:46.359 --> 00:14:47.920
and then I can choose a new color.

00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:52.029
In this case, I can just click on black
to change that text color to black,

00:14:52.659 --> 00:14:54.160
and that'll do it,

00:14:54.190 --> 00:14:56.679
so now you can see this text
has much better color contrast.

00:14:57.037 --> 00:15:00.070
That's one way you can fix
color contrast issues on the page-level.

00:15:01.029 --> 00:15:03.550
Next up, I'm going to skip down
to the heading next.

00:15:04.239 --> 00:15:06.405
I'll click on this heading
for Ingredients.

00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:10.358
You'll see, if you look again under
the block pane,

00:15:10.359 --> 00:15:13.173
under the block tab here, it says,
"This is just a paragraph,"

00:15:13.174 --> 00:15:14.589
but this actually should be set

00:15:14.590 --> 00:15:17.938
as not a paragraph block,
but a heading block.

00:15:18.679 --> 00:15:23.169
To change that, I'm going to navigate
to the toolbar for this block,

00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:26.349
and over here on the left,
start of this toolbar,

00:15:26.380 --> 00:15:28.030
there's a button titled Paragraph.

00:15:28.479 --> 00:15:30.519
When I click on that,
it'll open this little pop up,

00:15:31.029 --> 00:15:34.210
and I have options to transform
this to another type of block.

00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:36.280
In this case, I will select Heading.

00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:41.229
That is not quite working.

00:15:41.379 --> 00:15:43.360
I think I need to just try one more time.

00:15:52.179 --> 00:15:55.043
Okay, there we go.
I've set that as a heading now.

00:15:56.679 --> 00:15:59.289
Now you can see again,
under block on the right sidebar,

00:15:59.833 --> 00:16:01.989
it actually identifies
that as a heading block.

00:16:02.859 --> 00:16:04.838
You want to make sure your headings
are appropriate levels.

00:16:04.839 --> 00:16:06.070
Again, in the toolbar,

00:16:06.459 --> 00:16:09.569
for WordPress, there's a control
for change level.

00:16:09.570 --> 00:16:11.104
It has this icon H2.

00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:13.479
If you select that,
you can change it to a heading one,

00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:14.709
heading two, or heading three.

00:16:15.009 --> 00:16:17.649
In this case, a heading two makes
sense, so we'll leave it at that,

00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:20.349
and that's how you could fix
a heading level issue

00:16:20.350 --> 00:16:23.410
in the WordPress block editor
for a specific page.

00:16:24.339 --> 00:16:25.899
Next up, let's look at this photo here.

00:16:26.619 --> 00:16:30.255
When I select this photo again
in the block toolbar here,

00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:32.380
under settings,

00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:35.589
there's a field for alternative text,
and you can see that that's blank,

00:16:36.340 --> 00:16:37.380
which is not what we want.

00:16:37.930 --> 00:16:40.930
We want to make sure that this image
has good informative alternative text.

00:16:41.859 --> 00:16:44.109
In this case, before we do that,

00:16:44.110 --> 00:16:46.601
I'm going to back
out of the block editor for a moment.

00:16:46.602 --> 00:16:48.478
I'm going to click Save just for now.

00:16:50.834 --> 00:16:54.609
In the WordPress backend,
the dashboard here,

00:16:54.789 --> 00:16:56.439
I'm going to navigate to media,

00:16:56.470 --> 00:16:58.548
which is where you can find
photos on your site.

00:16:58.871 --> 00:17:02.199
I'm going to select this photo
that I had uploaded of black beans,

00:17:02.709 --> 00:17:06.518
and you can see there's a field here
for alternative text and also a field

00:17:06.519 --> 00:17:07.519
for description.

00:17:07.630 --> 00:17:08.630
Here, I added

00:17:08.859 --> 00:17:11.372
a small bowl of cooked
black beans beside a lime.

00:17:11.791 --> 00:17:14.359
That should actually be set
as the alternative text in this case

00:17:14.361 --> 00:17:17.818
so I'm going to copy that and paste it
into alternative text.

00:17:18.837 --> 00:17:23.260
Now, the next time I use this photo,
when I upload it again on another page,

00:17:23.349 --> 00:17:26.457
it'll have that as the default text,
which is awesome.

00:17:27.087 --> 00:17:29.967
Let's go back to the page we were looking
at and see how that affects it.

00:17:39.477 --> 00:17:42.426
When I navigate back to this image,
even though we just added

00:17:42.427 --> 00:17:45.549
alt text to it, you'll see that it still
doesn't have any alt text.

00:17:46.089 --> 00:17:48.289
That's actually, in some ways,
I would call it a feature

00:17:48.369 --> 00:17:51.820
because good alternative text
is contextual.

00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:54.999
The same image in different contexts,
you'll want to use

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:56.110
different alt text for it.

00:17:56.650 --> 00:17:58.210
That's what WordPress is assuming here.

00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:01.032
If I were to add the image again,
my understanding is

00:18:01.033 --> 00:18:03.160
that I think it would use
the default alt text,

00:18:03.369 --> 00:18:07.147
but since I already have it on the page,
it thinks I don't want any alt text here.

00:18:07.148 --> 00:18:10.630
In this case, I can just paste
the alt text that I had earlier into here,

00:18:10.660 --> 00:18:13.570
but if I wanted to change it
to be more specific to this page,

00:18:13.689 --> 00:18:14.689
I could.

00:18:14.889 --> 00:18:16.599
One reason you might want
to do this, for example,

00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:19.687
is if you have
an image of a dog at a park,

00:18:19.749 --> 00:18:23.109
and if the topic of the page
is just talking about dogs in general

00:18:23.312 --> 00:18:25.627
for a bunch of people who own dogs,

00:18:25.628 --> 00:18:27.608
you might want to have
general alt text that says,

00:18:27.609 --> 00:18:29.488
"A golden retriever chases a ball,"

00:18:30.009 --> 00:18:32.800
but if it's for your personal blog
where you share about your life,

00:18:33.189 --> 00:18:35.989
in that case, you might want to describe
the dog by their name and say,

00:18:36.610 --> 00:18:39.388
"Koda chases a ball at a park."

00:18:41.428 --> 00:18:44.619
That's one reason you might want
to have alt text for different cases.

00:18:44.829 --> 00:18:46.329
In this case, we added the alt text here.

00:18:46.330 --> 00:18:48.208
I'm going to go ahead and hit Save.

00:18:49.179 --> 00:18:53.518
Then we'll navigate back to this page,
and I will refresh it.

00:18:54.988 --> 00:18:57.640
Now you can see this text
is much better color contrast.

00:18:58.120 --> 00:19:00.208
This heading, if we inspect it,

00:19:01.539 --> 00:19:04.539
it is programmatically marked
as a heading level two,

00:19:04.540 --> 00:19:05.788
which is great.

00:19:06.550 --> 00:19:08.179
If I inspect the image as well,

00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:11.168
you'll see that it now
has alt text for it.

00:19:12.789 --> 00:19:14.708
That would be an example
of how you can remediate

00:19:14.709 --> 00:19:17.199
some page-level accessibility issues
on WordPress.

00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:19.780
Ultimately, page-level issues
are things that you can,

00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:22.899
for the most part, fix
once you view the page here

00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:24.670
in the WordPress block editor.

00:19:25.090 --> 00:19:27.519
You want to make sure you're using
the proper block type,

00:19:27.789 --> 00:19:30.640
if it's a list or a heading
or a paragraph.

00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:36.349
You want to make sure you have
sufficient color contrast.

00:19:36.350 --> 00:19:39.790
Yes, that mostly covers it, so we're going
to have to move on from there.

00:19:41.589 --> 00:19:43.270
I'll jump back to our presentation.

00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:52.240
Next, we are going to talk
about plugin-level issues.

00:19:55.090 --> 00:19:57.699
Plugin-level issues are
the most, I would say,

00:19:57.789 --> 00:20:00.849
maybe complicated to remediate,
or at least the most complicated

00:20:00.850 --> 00:20:05.500
to figure out because plugins
do so many different things in WordPress.

00:20:06.099 --> 00:20:10.629
If a plugin adds a component to your site,
and if there's an accessibility issue

00:20:10.630 --> 00:20:14.799
with that component specifically,
it's probably a plugin-level issue.

00:20:14.979 --> 00:20:18.790
For example, if you wanted a tab control
on your site or an accordion,

00:20:18.819 --> 00:20:21.699
and if you add a plugin to do that,
and then if there is

00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:24.900
an accessibility issue with that,
it's probably from that plugin.

00:20:26.319 --> 00:20:29.799
I would recommend that you keep
your plugins as limited as possible

00:20:29.979 --> 00:20:33.190
and used for very specific purposes,
otherwise,

00:20:33.191 --> 00:20:37.420
it might be harder to identify
the exact source of plugin-level issues.

00:20:37.421 --> 00:20:42.550
If you have multiple plugins
for accordions,

00:20:42.552 --> 00:20:45.461
for example, or if you have
plugins that kind of overlap,

00:20:47.079 --> 00:20:51.070
so try to use as few plugins as possible,
have them for very clear purposes,

00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:52.629
and that'll help you identify,

00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:55.599
"Oh, there's an issue
with this specific thing on the site.

00:20:55.630 --> 00:20:58.328
We know that's related
to a plugin, so that's probably

00:20:58.329 --> 00:21:00.095
the source of this issue."

00:21:02.465 --> 00:21:06.254
Here, I'm going to jump
back to our test site

00:21:06.255 --> 00:21:08.045
and show you a plugin-level issue.

00:21:10.625 --> 00:21:15.790
On this page, I installed a plugin
for a tab control component.

00:21:16.079 --> 00:21:17.079
It's very simple.

00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:19.449
There's just two tabs called
first tab and second tab,

00:21:19.450 --> 00:21:22.779
and they both have
some lorem ipsum filler text in it.

00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:28.329
The issue with this tab component
is it's missing a visible focus indicator.

00:21:29.079 --> 00:21:32.349
I'm going to try to navigate this page
using the tab key for a moment.

00:21:34.089 --> 00:21:38.289
This is something that sighted users,
who have mobility challenges might do

00:21:38.290 --> 00:21:40.868
to navigate a site.
Rather than using a mouse,

00:21:40.869 --> 00:21:42.788
or a touchscreen,
they might use a keyboard

00:21:42.789 --> 00:21:45.400
or other types of assistive technology
that mimics a keyboard.

00:21:46.089 --> 00:21:48.099
In order to know
how to activate a control,

00:21:48.130 --> 00:21:50.199
they need to see
a visible focus indicator.

00:21:50.894 --> 00:21:53.229
Right now, you can see
there's this dotted outline

00:21:53.260 --> 00:21:55.120
around the one comment link,

00:21:55.810 --> 00:21:57.640
and so that indicates
that if I press Enter,

00:21:57.730 --> 00:21:59.439
that'll activate that control right now.

00:21:59.739 --> 00:22:01.330
That has a visible focus indicator,

00:22:01.899 --> 00:22:04.569
but when I press Tab to try
to navigate to the next control,

00:22:05.758 --> 00:22:06.758
there's nothing.

00:22:06.759 --> 00:22:09.698
There's no visible indicator
of what currently has keyboard focus,

00:22:09.699 --> 00:22:13.179
of what will be activated if I press Tab.
If I press Tab again,

00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:15.940
still no visible keyboard focus indicator.

00:22:16.899 --> 00:22:19.748
If I press it again, you'll see
this edit control at the bottom

00:22:19.749 --> 00:22:22.389
now does have a focus outline.

00:22:23.319 --> 00:22:26.379
That's what I would call
a plugin-level issue because I installed

00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:27.380
this plugin here

00:22:27.789 --> 00:22:29.050
for this tab control,

00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:33.369
and it's missing a focus indicator,
very clearly related to that.

00:22:35.050 --> 00:22:37.659
How do we go about fixing
these plugin-level issues?

00:22:41.950 --> 00:22:45.970
First, I would recommend make
sure you're using the plugin properly.

00:22:46.870 --> 00:22:51.070
If possible, you want to change
how that plugin or that specific component

00:22:51.099 --> 00:22:53.260
is configured to fix the issue.

00:22:54.069 --> 00:22:56.678
Some plugins are very simple
and don't give you a lot of options,

00:22:56.679 --> 00:22:58.300
but others are very complex.

00:22:59.169 --> 00:23:01.628
It might be possible to use
the plugin accessibly,

00:23:01.629 --> 00:23:04.509
but it might not be the default,
which is unfortunate,

00:23:04.510 --> 00:23:06.640
but it is often the case
with a lot of plugins,

00:23:06.970 --> 00:23:09.069
that if you configure it
in a particular way,

00:23:09.129 --> 00:23:11.169
it'll be accessible,
but the default is not.

00:23:11.830 --> 00:23:14.770
First, make sure you've configured it
in the best possible way,

00:23:14.799 --> 00:23:17.378
you've looked
over all of the options, and also make

00:23:17.379 --> 00:23:19.060
sure you've checked out
some documentation.

00:23:19.634 --> 00:23:22.900
Larger plugins will have documentation
about how to get it set up

00:23:23.620 --> 00:23:26.078
and used properly, so make
sure you give that a read over.

00:23:26.079 --> 00:23:30.368
It very well might be possible to fix
your plugin-level issues just by changing

00:23:30.369 --> 00:23:32.199
how you have configured your plugin.

00:23:32.770 --> 00:23:36.640
This is going to vary a lot
depending on what the actual issue is

00:23:36.790 --> 00:23:38.019
and what plugin you're using.

00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:42.999
Now, if that doesn't work,
and if it's a CSS-level issues,

00:23:43.449 --> 00:23:48.070
you can try adding custom CSS
in the additional CSS panel

00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:50.590
within the theme customizer,

00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:53.441
and I'm going to show you
how to do this in just a minute.

00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:57.259
Actually, we should show you now,
and then we'll come back.

00:23:57.260 --> 00:24:03.250
CSS-level issues typically result
in low color contrast,

00:24:03.729 --> 00:24:09.608
or we're just looking at a lack
of a visible keyboard focus indicator

00:24:09.609 --> 00:24:11.409
is also a CSS-level issues.

00:24:12.310 --> 00:24:14.040
Let's look at how we might fix that one.

00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:16.830
Here I'm going to inspect this code,

00:24:17.460 --> 00:24:25.300
this tab control in Chrome DevTools,
and I'm going to filter for Focus styles.

00:24:26.859 --> 00:24:32.049
You'll see that there is this one CSS rule
here that says it does actually have

00:24:32.050 --> 00:24:34.358
an outline,
but it's a transparent outline,

00:24:34.359 --> 00:24:36.399
so you don't see it, which is not great.

00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:38.949
What I'm going to do is I'm going
to copy this CSS rule,

00:24:39.939 --> 00:24:41.560
and then in the WordPress backend,

00:24:42.879 --> 00:24:44.140
I'm going to navigate

00:24:45.130 --> 00:24:46.210
to appearance,

00:24:46.780 --> 00:24:48.130
and then customize.

00:24:52.479 --> 00:24:55.719
Then on this next page,
I'll navigate down to additional CSS

00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:57.550
in this left side bar with options,

00:24:58.750 --> 00:25:01.359
and here I can add
additional CSS to the site.

00:25:01.839 --> 00:25:05.080
I'm going to paste
that CSS rule that I had copied,

00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:08.019
and I'm going to change
that to something new,

00:25:08.049 --> 00:25:11.308
so we're using the same CSS selector,
but instead of saying the outline

00:25:11.391 --> 00:25:13.194
is transparent, I'm going to say--

00:25:14.442 --> 00:25:15.657
Give me one moment here.

00:25:15.658 --> 00:25:26.589
[silence]

00:25:26.590 --> 00:25:28.231
Sorry, I'm having some keyboard troubles.

00:25:28.870 --> 00:25:29.870
There we go.

00:25:30.189 --> 00:25:33.909
Instead of saying it should have
a transparent outline,

00:25:33.939 --> 00:25:36.399
I'm going to give it
a text decoration of underline,

00:25:36.669 --> 00:25:38.139
and then I will hit Publish.

00:25:39.181 --> 00:25:40.920
Now, let's go back and reload that page,

00:25:45.310 --> 00:25:49.230
and I'm going to try to again use
the tab key to navigate across this page.

00:25:59.141 --> 00:26:01.130
Let me make that a little bigger for you.

00:26:01.131 --> 00:26:02.559
I'll press Tab,

00:26:04.749 --> 00:26:07.599
and you can see the one comment control
does have a focus outline,

00:26:07.630 --> 00:26:08.679
and I'll press Tab again,

00:26:09.370 --> 00:26:13.947
and now you can see
that first tab control has an underline,

00:26:13.948 --> 00:26:15.909
so that indicates
that that has keyboard focus.

00:26:15.999 --> 00:26:17.019
If I press Tab again,

00:26:17.530 --> 00:26:20.710
the second tab control has an underline,
which means it has keyboard focus,

00:26:20.739 --> 00:26:21.910
so if I press Enter now,

00:26:23.049 --> 00:26:24.640
that'll change to the other tab.

00:26:25.297 --> 00:26:28.629
That's one way that you can fix
CSS-level issues with the plugin,

00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:35.710
find the specific CSS selector,
and then write a new style to override it.

00:26:42.159 --> 00:26:43.238
What if that doesn't work?

00:26:43.239 --> 00:26:46.600
What if you have what I would say is
a fundamentally inaccessible plugin?

00:26:47.559 --> 00:26:50.828
In that case, you got to reach out
to the plugin developer and file

00:26:50.829 --> 00:26:52.090
an accessibility bug.

00:26:52.749 --> 00:26:57.040
It is important that plugin developers
know that accessibility issues exist

00:26:57.188 --> 00:26:58.188
in their code,

00:26:58.329 --> 00:27:00.569
it's important that they know
that users care about that,

00:27:00.999 --> 00:27:03.099
and it's important
that they fix it for all users.

00:27:03.340 --> 00:27:06.229
Even if you're able to fix it
by changing the CSS,

00:27:06.460 --> 00:27:07.860
you might want to reach out anyway.

00:27:09.699 --> 00:27:12.670
It's also important to know
that a lot of plugin developers

00:27:13.570 --> 00:27:16.389
may not be full-time people
doing this as their job,

00:27:16.390 --> 00:27:18.969
it might be their side gig,
or for some people it might even be

00:27:18.970 --> 00:27:20.050
their unpaid hobby,

00:27:20.350 --> 00:27:24.699
so I would reach out and be very polite
and offer to work with them.

00:27:25.237 --> 00:27:27.158
Understand
that for some people it might take

00:27:27.159 --> 00:27:30.850
a little bit more time depending
on how much support is behind this plugin.

00:27:31.749 --> 00:27:36.189
I would also recommend that you describe
the real-world impacts to users

00:27:36.219 --> 00:27:39.010
so that the plugin developers
can understand how it affects people,

00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:41.888
and if it's important
to you, you can also describe

00:27:41.889 --> 00:27:44.919
how it impacts
your site's accessibility compliance.

00:27:46.449 --> 00:27:50.379
I would also recommend that you try
to be as descriptive as possible

00:27:50.679 --> 00:27:52.839
about both what the current issue is

00:27:53.830 --> 00:27:56.290
and how it could or should be fixed.

00:27:56.619 --> 00:27:59.110
Remember that if there's
accessibility issues in a plugin,

00:27:59.709 --> 00:28:02.349
you might know more about accessibility
than the plugin developer,

00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:04.140
so try to share that knowledge with them.

00:28:04.510 --> 00:28:06.578
Otherwise, if you just say,
"There's this problem,

00:28:06.579 --> 00:28:09.699
we need it fixed," they might not know
how to go about fixing it

00:28:09.789 --> 00:28:11.650
or what it would look like to fix it.

00:28:12.490 --> 00:28:14.919
Try to work with them,
be polite, be cooperative,

00:28:15.639 --> 00:28:19.719
read any documentation they have
about how to contact them and work

00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:20.720
from there.

00:28:21.460 --> 00:28:23.859
If for whatever reason
that's not going to work for you,

00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:26.520
if they don't get back to you,
if they're resistant to changing it

00:28:27.969 --> 00:28:30.429
that means you need to essentially find
a replacement plugin.

00:28:30.490 --> 00:28:34.449
Look for one that can fill the same need
on your site but doesn't have

00:28:34.450 --> 00:28:35.829
accessibility issues built in.

00:28:36.099 --> 00:28:38.485
Always be careful when you're switching

00:28:38.486 --> 00:28:40.418
to a new plugin or deciding
to use one on your site.

00:28:40.419 --> 00:28:42.939
I would recommend you always do
some accessibility testing to begin

00:28:42.940 --> 00:28:45.675
with before you become
really committed to it,

00:28:46.737 --> 00:28:49.659
but that's essentially
what you have to do,

00:28:49.690 --> 00:28:51.996
find a replacement
if it's not going to work.

00:28:51.997 --> 00:28:54.668
Now, I know some people
might be thinking, "I'm really attached

00:28:54.669 --> 00:28:55.909
to this one plugin we're using.

00:28:56.169 --> 00:28:58.599
The plugin developer isn't going
to work with us to fix it.

00:28:58.719 --> 00:29:00.068
I can't find a replacement.

00:29:00.069 --> 00:29:01.445
Is there anything I can do?"

00:29:01.446 --> 00:29:04.389
In that case, if you really need
to do something,

00:29:04.780 --> 00:29:08.498
or try to fix your plugin,
you can try to create

00:29:08.499 --> 00:29:13.947
a secondary plugin that will extend
the original plugin using custom hooks.

00:29:14.470 --> 00:29:18.639
Now, this will only work
if the developer of the original plugin

00:29:18.849 --> 00:29:22.568
created custom hooks
in that original plugin for you

00:29:22.569 --> 00:29:24.339
to essentially hook into and work with.

00:29:25.509 --> 00:29:28.599
If those custom hooks aren't
in that original plugin,

00:29:28.930 --> 00:29:31.629
you would then need
to modify your local version,

00:29:31.989 --> 00:29:36.309
add custom hooks, and then be able
to create that secondary plugin.

00:29:36.669 --> 00:29:38.529
If you're doing that,
I would recommend then you submit

00:29:38.530 --> 00:29:40.299
a patch to the original developer
and be like,

00:29:40.300 --> 00:29:42.788
"Can you please add
at least these custom hooks so that people

00:29:42.789 --> 00:29:44.919
can modify plugins?"

00:29:46.390 --> 00:29:48.848
You might be wondering, "Why
would I create a secondary plugin instead

00:29:48.849 --> 00:29:51.250
of just editing
the original plugin on my site?"

00:29:52.419 --> 00:29:57.100
That's because you should generally try
to avoid modifying a plugin directly,

00:29:57.370 --> 00:30:00.970
like the local version of a plugin
that you have installed on your site.

00:30:02.289 --> 00:30:04.929
That's because if you go ahead
and update that plugin,

00:30:05.469 --> 00:30:07.419
your changes will be overwritten.

00:30:07.599 --> 00:30:08.599
You will lose them.

00:30:09.339 --> 00:30:11.219
You might think, "Okay,
I just won't update it,"

00:30:11.349 --> 00:30:14.378
but if you do not update your plugin,
that means you're going to miss out

00:30:14.379 --> 00:30:16.479
on new features,
and you might even miss out

00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:17.799
on security patches,

00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:20.200
so that's not really
a good thing you're going to want to do.

00:30:21.399 --> 00:30:23.709
Again, if there is
an issue with your plugin,

00:30:24.009 --> 00:30:26.769
and you really want to fix it,
but the developer won't

00:30:27.729 --> 00:30:28.729
fix it,

00:30:28.870 --> 00:30:33.460
you can try to create the secondary plugin
that will hook into it using custom hooks.

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.550
Sometimes this is referred to
as an add-on plugin,

00:30:38.109 --> 00:30:41.872
but here I'm going to note,
this is really quite advanced

00:30:41.873 --> 00:30:43.859
and really beyond
the scope of this presentation.

00:30:43.860 --> 00:30:46.288
I think you could probably do
a whole other presentation on this,

00:30:46.289 --> 00:30:48.119
so I look forward to watching that one.

00:30:48.419 --> 00:30:50.970
This is the part I have
the least experience with,

00:30:51.270 --> 00:30:53.429
and I will say, this
is pretty complicated stuff.

00:30:55.433 --> 00:30:58.378
You really want someone who's more
of a WordPress developer,

00:30:58.379 --> 00:31:00.900
who knows how to design
plugins to be able to do this.

00:31:01.446 --> 00:31:03.366
If you don't have someone
like that on your team,

00:31:03.630 --> 00:31:05.510
you're going to just have
to find a replacement,

00:31:05.699 --> 00:31:08.399
but if you really need an option,
this is something you can look into.

00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:11.819
At the end of this presentation, I'll have
a couple links to WordPress documentation

00:31:11.849 --> 00:31:14.323
on custom hooks that you can read

00:31:14.324 --> 00:31:17.219
to get a little bit better sense
of how that might work.

00:31:18.509 --> 00:31:21.450
My overall advice here, though,
is don't do this.

00:31:22.110 --> 00:31:23.849
If it's an accessibility issue
with a plugin,

00:31:23.850 --> 00:31:28.559
it really should be fixed at the core
so that it's fixed for everyone,

00:31:28.799 --> 00:31:30.352
all the different users of the plugin,

00:31:30.353 --> 00:31:32.159
and all the different users
of those sites.

00:31:32.700 --> 00:31:34.963
Also, this can be quite complicated.

00:31:35.730 --> 00:31:37.649
Try not to do this,
but if you really need to,

00:31:37.799 --> 00:31:39.343
it's something you can look into.

00:31:43.033 --> 00:31:45.720
This is again a slide I'm going
to skip over because I just showed you

00:31:45.721 --> 00:31:48.659
how you can fix
some plugin-level issues by adding CSS

00:31:49.979 --> 00:31:51.943
in the additional CSS panel.

00:31:58.165 --> 00:31:59.526
There we go.

00:31:59.528 --> 00:32:02.368
Next up, let's talk
about theme-level issues.

00:32:04.108 --> 00:32:06.959
Theme-level issues on a WordPress site

00:32:07.710 --> 00:32:10.919
may include default text color
that results

00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:12.660
in insufficient color contrast.

00:32:13.346 --> 00:32:16.470
This would be text
on multiple pages throughout your site.

00:32:17.669 --> 00:32:20.159
Another theme-level issue
could be inline links,

00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:22.799
which is links
in the middle of a paragraph that use

00:32:22.829 --> 00:32:26.159
color alone to visually indicate
that they are interactive.

00:32:26.910 --> 00:32:29.549
Typically, if you have links
in the middle of a paragraph,

00:32:29.850 --> 00:32:31.888
you want to make sure that they have
underlines so that users

00:32:31.889 --> 00:32:35.939
can easily see that,
"Hey, that's an interactive control."

00:32:37.199 --> 00:32:39.899
That is typically set
as a style at the theme-level,

00:32:40.139 --> 00:32:43.059
and so if there's an issue with that,
that's probably a theme-level issue.

00:32:44.850 --> 00:32:47.908
Other theme-level issues
can include really anything in your header

00:32:47.909 --> 00:32:50.309
or your footer or perhaps even
in your sidebars,

00:32:51.270 --> 00:32:53.249
common components
that are repeated throughout

00:32:53.250 --> 00:32:54.446
your whole site.

00:32:54.764 --> 00:32:59.129
Those are probably the archetypical
examples of theme-level issues,

00:32:59.130 --> 00:33:01.276
anything in your footer or header.

00:33:03.197 --> 00:33:06.557
Here, let's look
at a theme-level issue on the site.

00:33:08.327 --> 00:33:10.817
Give me one moment
to check my notes on this.

00:33:11.820 --> 00:33:13.739
In this case,
I'll just show you on this page.

00:33:14.429 --> 00:33:17.940
Here we have the heading Hello World
for this blog post,

00:33:18.269 --> 00:33:20.755
and then right underneath it,
it shows you the date.

00:33:20.756 --> 00:33:24.120
It says September 28th,
2024, and then one comment

00:33:24.150 --> 00:33:27.390
before it gives you a preview
of the actual text in the post,

00:33:27.900 --> 00:33:31.589
but that text with the actual date
is very low color contrast.

00:33:31.650 --> 00:33:35.578
It's again light gray text
on a white background,

00:33:35.579 --> 00:33:36.579
so it's hard to see.

00:33:36.810 --> 00:33:38.699
This is something that's set
at the theme-level

00:33:38.700 --> 00:33:41.910
because it's part of a component
that's repeated across a lot of pages.

00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:44.969
If I were to go
to this Hello World post on my site

00:33:45.330 --> 00:33:49.589
and look at it just in the page view,
I wouldn't see that September date

00:33:49.590 --> 00:33:51.750
anywhere because it's part
of the metadata of the post.

00:33:52.274 --> 00:33:57.090
When your users actually visit the site
again that comes from the theme.

00:33:57.569 --> 00:34:00.644
This is an example of what I would say is
a theme-level issue.

00:34:01.754 --> 00:34:03.734
How could you fix it?

00:34:04.349 --> 00:34:07.335
First, with theme-level issues,
you have what I would call the easy way.

00:34:08.358 --> 00:34:09.358
You have two options here.

00:34:09.359 --> 00:34:13.709
The first is to go to the theme customizer
and look for relevant options

00:34:13.769 --> 00:34:17.699
and then adjust those as appropriate,
if you have any good options.

00:34:18.309 --> 00:34:20.369
If there are issues
in your sidebar or footer,

00:34:20.370 --> 00:34:22.589
in the theme customizer,
you can look under widgets

00:34:22.590 --> 00:34:26.579
and you might be able to edit
those using the WordPress block editor.

00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:29.820
Then again if there are CSS-level issues

00:34:30.420 --> 00:34:35.417
with your theme, you can again try adding
custom CSS in the additional CSS panel.

00:34:36.467 --> 00:34:40.228
This is something I'm going to show you
how to do now to fix this one issue

00:34:40.229 --> 00:34:43.847
on our site.
Again, I'll go to the Homepage.

00:34:46.169 --> 00:34:48.609
You'll see we have this text
that has very low color contrast.

00:34:50.010 --> 00:34:51.010
In WordPress,

00:34:51.149 --> 00:34:53.940
I'm going in the back end,
I'll navigate to Appearance,

00:34:54.599 --> 00:34:55.697
Customize.

00:34:57.149 --> 00:35:00.086
This theme that I've installed,
it's called Nucleare.

00:35:00.087 --> 00:35:02.279
It actually has an option for colors here.

00:35:02.669 --> 00:35:05.129
The exact options
that you might have are going to vary

00:35:05.130 --> 00:35:08.610
based on what theme you've installed
and what options it gives you,

00:35:09.449 --> 00:35:13.109
but this theme I'm using actually lets me
select a secondary text color.

00:35:13.529 --> 00:35:14.698
You can see that this actually is

00:35:14.699 --> 00:35:16.918
a light gray, so I'm going
to click on this.

00:35:16.919 --> 00:35:19.316
I'm going to try to change
this to, let's say, black.

00:35:21.594 --> 00:35:23.728
As soon as I do that,
you can see that this text

00:35:23.729 --> 00:35:26.816
that we were looking at,
September 28th, 2024,

00:35:27.270 --> 00:35:28.270
is now black.

00:35:28.456 --> 00:35:30.840
If I hit Publish,
that'll make the change there.

00:35:31.499 --> 00:35:33.139
I'm going to go ahead and reload the page

00:35:33.899 --> 00:35:35.097
and that actually fixed it.

00:35:35.098 --> 00:35:38.849
With some theme-level issues,
you can fix them just by coming

00:35:38.850 --> 00:35:43.379
to the customizer and exploring
the available options here and seeing

00:35:43.410 --> 00:35:44.519
what you're able to change.

00:35:44.549 --> 00:35:46.980
For some theme-level issues,
that'll do the trick,

00:35:47.219 --> 00:35:48.219
which is awesome.

00:35:48.629 --> 00:35:51.048
That is again
what I would call the easy way.

00:35:51.557 --> 00:35:56.609
Again, that will vary based on your theme
and what options it supports users

00:35:56.610 --> 00:35:58.398
to tweak with in that manner.

00:36:00.660 --> 00:36:01.660
What about the hard way?

00:36:02.489 --> 00:36:05.158
Again, you can reach out
to the theme developer and file

00:36:05.159 --> 00:36:06.209
an accessibility bug.

00:36:06.869 --> 00:36:08.998
Again, even if you're able to do it
the easy way,

00:36:08.999 --> 00:36:11.279
you might want to do this anyway
so that it can be fixed

00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:13.915
for all users of that theme
across multiple sites.

00:36:14.605 --> 00:36:17.279
A lot of what I said
about working with developers

00:36:17.849 --> 00:36:19.230
for plugins applies here.

00:36:19.529 --> 00:36:20.820
Be polite. Work with them.

00:36:20.879 --> 00:36:23.549
Be specific about the issue
and how it could be fixed.

00:36:24.809 --> 00:36:25.809
If that doesn't work,

00:36:25.949 --> 00:36:28.109
time again, you got
to switch from your theme

00:36:28.169 --> 00:36:30.660
to a different theme,
one that's more accessible.

00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:34.500
If you go to wordpress.org and look
in the theme repository there,

00:36:34.770 --> 00:36:36.359
there's a tag you should search for.

00:36:36.360 --> 00:36:39.587
It's called accessibility-ready.

00:36:39.959 --> 00:36:43.529
All of the themes that are marked
as accessibility-ready,

00:36:43.799 --> 00:36:46.740
have undergone
additional accessibility testing.

00:36:47.070 --> 00:36:49.770
Now, that doesn't guarantee
that they're perfect and flawless,

00:36:49.950 --> 00:36:52.980
but it means they've passed
a much higher bar of accessibility

00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:54.359
than most themes.

00:36:55.049 --> 00:36:57.298
If you're looking for a theme,
I would always suggest start

00:36:57.299 --> 00:36:58.738
with the accessibility-ready themes.

00:36:58.739 --> 00:37:01.740
Those ones are likely to have
the least amount of issues with them.

00:37:03.269 --> 00:37:06.119
Now, some of you again may be saying,
"I really like my theme,

00:37:06.239 --> 00:37:08.548
and my server won't fix it,
and I can't quite fix it

00:37:08.549 --> 00:37:10.829
the easy way, and I don't want
to switch to another one,

00:37:10.830 --> 00:37:11.830
what can I do?"

00:37:12.270 --> 00:37:17.160
In that case, you can create
a child theme to override

00:37:17.430 --> 00:37:19.980
the broken portions of your parent theme.

00:37:21.119 --> 00:37:24.210
Now, again why would you create
a child theme instead of just edit

00:37:24.269 --> 00:37:27.150
the local theme that you have
installed on your server?

00:37:27.810 --> 00:37:28.810
Similarly,

00:37:28.829 --> 00:37:33.750
if you edit that local version directly,
and then if you update your theme later,

00:37:34.140 --> 00:37:37.049
your changes will be overridden
and removed,

00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:40.109
which is not really a thing you want,
but with a child theme,

00:37:40.110 --> 00:37:41.110
if you set one up,

00:37:41.340 --> 00:37:45.628
and then if you update your theme later,
the parent theme,

00:37:46.198 --> 00:37:48.060
your edits will persist.

00:37:48.662 --> 00:37:50.908
That's the big perk
for using a child theme.

00:37:53.819 --> 00:37:56.520
Now, child themes are,
I would say, relatively easy

00:37:56.579 --> 00:38:00.883
to set up and start using,
but they can get quite complicated

00:38:00.884 --> 00:38:05.254
and require some major revisions
to the parent theme.

00:38:06.994 --> 00:38:08.369
Keep that in mind.

00:38:08.370 --> 00:38:10.799
If you're just making
a couple tweaks, it's not too hard.

00:38:10.830 --> 00:38:12.899
I would say it's more
of an intermediate-level thing,

00:38:12.900 --> 00:38:17.284
but if you're really making big changes,
then it can be more of an advanced task.

00:38:18.214 --> 00:38:21.839
Essentially, the way
the child theme works is you add a folder

00:38:21.869 --> 00:38:25.200
to your WordPress server where you store
your themes for your child theme.

00:38:25.499 --> 00:38:28.649
You have to set it up in a particular way,
but it's not too complicated.

00:38:29.189 --> 00:38:32.998
Then any files that you have
in your child theme folder will override

00:38:32.999 --> 00:38:35.335
the equivalent files for the parent theme.

00:38:35.725 --> 00:38:38.465
The one exception is
for your functions.php file,

00:38:38.520 --> 00:38:40.885
which will be added in addition to that.

00:38:41.335 --> 00:38:43.975
It'll be loaded immediately
before the parents.

00:38:45.390 --> 00:38:47.005
If you're setting up a child theme,

00:38:47.790 --> 00:38:51.118
what you can do is you can try
to identify the relevant attributes

00:38:51.119 --> 00:38:53.880
in the source code,
and then search for those,

00:38:53.900 --> 00:38:55.349
the source code of the parent theme.

00:38:55.709 --> 00:38:56.709
Search for those.

00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:58.769
Through trial and error,
you can figure out

00:38:58.770 --> 00:39:02.219
how to tweak the parent theme
to fix any issues you have with it

00:39:03.330 --> 00:39:07.229
and then you're
off to the races essentially.

00:39:07.980 --> 00:39:10.798
If you're doing a child theme,
I would highly suggest you set up

00:39:10.799 --> 00:39:16.079
a local WordPress environment
or a staging site where you can test out

00:39:16.080 --> 00:39:18.870
your changes before pushing them
to the production site

00:39:19.560 --> 00:39:21.568
because there might be
a bit of trial and error,

00:39:21.569 --> 00:39:23.906
and you could accidentally break
things in your theme

00:39:24.599 --> 00:39:27.240
before you figure out the correct changes
to make.

00:39:27.929 --> 00:39:29.489
Then, again,
when you're updating your theme,

00:39:29.490 --> 00:39:32.699
there's a chance things
could get broken again,

00:39:32.700 --> 00:39:36.179
and so if it's a bigger update,
more of a chance if it's a small update

00:39:36.180 --> 00:39:39.778
to the theme, it'll probably be okay,
but each time you update

00:39:39.779 --> 00:39:42.478
the theme, you might need to go back
and make some tweaks on your side

00:39:42.479 --> 00:39:43.479
to your child theme,

00:39:44.099 --> 00:39:46.890
and that's something you would want
to do in a local environment

00:39:47.009 --> 00:39:48.327
or on a staging site.

00:39:49.259 --> 00:39:51.446
How do you actually go
about finding that all?

00:39:54.686 --> 00:39:56.430
This is something I can go
into more detail,

00:39:56.431 --> 00:39:59.220
but we are at about our 40-minute mark,
so I'm going to cut it here.

00:39:59.310 --> 00:40:02.549
If you have more questions
about child themes,

00:40:03.089 --> 00:40:06.440
I can explain them in more detail.

00:40:06.980 --> 00:40:09.210
Essentially, one thing
which is really useful

00:40:09.539 --> 00:40:12.150
in some code editors
like Visual Studio Code

00:40:12.479 --> 00:40:18.930
is you can actually search
for text within not just one file,

00:40:19.050 --> 00:40:20.400
but across a whole directory.

00:40:20.879 --> 00:40:22.559
In this case, in Visual Studio Code,

00:40:23.610 --> 00:40:25.859
I opened up the folder
for the parent theme,

00:40:26.100 --> 00:40:29.490
and I knew there was an issue
with this particular CSS selector,

00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:31.859
the class small part.

00:40:32.279 --> 00:40:35.608
I searched for that CSS selector,
and then it took me right

00:40:35.609 --> 00:40:39.840
to that style.css
and showed me where that was.

00:40:40.290 --> 00:40:46.683
By changing that color variable to black,
that could also solve this issue.

00:40:49.529 --> 00:40:52.890
That's essentially
the way you would create a child theme.

00:40:52.919 --> 00:40:57.559
Search for very specific CSS selectors
or classes and see where those are

00:40:57.560 --> 00:41:01.520
in the parent theme, and then try to make
changes to see if you can get it to work.

00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:06.199
For reference, I have a couple links
here to hooks and custom hooks

00:41:06.230 --> 00:41:10.099
in the WordPress developer documentation,
which is a great place to look

00:41:10.100 --> 00:41:13.130
if you need to try to edit a plugin.

00:41:13.339 --> 00:41:15.559
Again, I would recommend avoiding
that if you can,

00:41:15.620 --> 00:41:17.535
but you can dive into that if you want to.

00:41:18.293 --> 00:41:20.786
I also have links
to the accessibility-ready themes

00:41:20.787 --> 00:41:24.022
you can investigate and the documentation
for child themes,

00:41:24.023 --> 00:41:26.453
which I think is not too difficult
of a thing.

00:41:27.140 --> 00:41:29.568
Most intermediate level users
should be able to set up

00:41:29.569 --> 00:41:32.084
if you're making only limited changes.

00:41:33.944 --> 00:41:37.789
I also have a couple links here
to the theme I used for this presentation,

00:41:37.819 --> 00:41:38.819
Nucleare,

00:41:38.959 --> 00:41:42.230
the tab plugin I used,
which was called Tabby responsive tabs,

00:41:42.709 --> 00:41:46.610
and the photo of black beans that I used
in case you're interested in any of those.

00:41:48.200 --> 00:41:49.219
Thank you for your time,

00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:53.659
and now we can pause for questions
for the next 10 minutes or so,

00:41:53.660 --> 00:41:55.308
I believe.
<v Laura> Awesome.

00:41:55.309 --> 00:41:56.478
Thank you very much, Cam.

00:41:56.479 --> 00:41:57.529
I appreciate that,

00:41:58.130 --> 00:41:59.564
an awesome job.

00:41:59.565 --> 00:42:04.039
Yes, we have a lot of questions,
and we had a big chat going on,

00:42:04.339 --> 00:42:07.789
which is great, and it's always good
to learn from each other.

00:42:08.419 --> 00:42:10.632
Our first question is from Sherry.

00:42:10.633 --> 00:42:16.482
Is there a place where the known
compatibility issues

00:42:16.483 --> 00:42:18.792
with regard to accessibility are listed?

00:42:23.463 --> 00:42:25.062
<v Cam> Can you read that one more time?

00:42:25.063 --> 00:42:29.868
<v Laura> Is there a place where the known
compatibility issues with regard

00:42:29.869 --> 00:42:32.480
to accessibility are listed?

00:42:33.068 --> 00:42:34.068
That's a good question.

00:42:34.069 --> 00:42:36.589
I don't think there's
one place because as we looked

00:42:36.590 --> 00:42:37.639
at in this presentation,

00:42:38.359 --> 00:42:41.254
there's a lot of things
that go into a WordPress site,

00:42:41.255 --> 00:42:43.670
so you'd probably want
to look at, for example,

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:49.158
like your theme might have a bug tracker,
and it might list accessibility issues

00:42:49.159 --> 00:42:50.104
with your theme,

00:42:50.105 --> 00:42:54.109
but that would be probably
in a different GitHub repository

00:42:54.110 --> 00:42:57.978
or code repository than the one
where accessibility issues

00:42:57.979 --> 00:42:59.689
for WordPress core are tracked,

00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:03.678
and so it's going to depend
on where the exact issue comes

00:43:03.679 --> 00:43:04.826
from ultimately.

00:43:05.606 --> 00:43:09.296
<v Laura> I think too, depending
on your level experience,

00:43:09.650 --> 00:43:15.859
I know that a bunch of us have done
presentations where the top five things,

00:43:16.070 --> 00:43:18.290
like those basic things of what to check,

00:43:18.799 --> 00:43:21.620
the contrast is one, like you pointed out,

00:43:22.519 --> 00:43:26.126
the font size and that
kind of thing, so yes,

00:43:26.389 --> 00:43:28.759
it depends on your level
of experience too,

00:43:28.760 --> 00:43:31.133
and you just got to learn
and build upon that too.

00:43:32.963 --> 00:43:34.613
All right, our next question.

00:43:34.969 --> 00:43:36.680
Is the text used

00:43:37.310 --> 00:43:39.260
an accessible font?

00:43:39.710 --> 00:43:40.818
How can we tell?

00:43:40.819 --> 00:43:44.723
Are there checks
to call out inaccessible fonts?

00:43:47.506 --> 00:43:48.676
<v Cam> Yes.

00:43:50.836 --> 00:43:53.135
In this case, I'm going to have to give
a shout out to Equalize Digital.

00:43:53.136 --> 00:43:57.258
They have a plugin that you can use
in a WordPress site.

00:43:57.259 --> 00:43:59.658
You install the plugin,
and it'll actually flag

00:43:59.659 --> 00:44:02.727
accessibility issues for you
through the WordPress interface.

00:44:03.709 --> 00:44:05.787
That's a good way to sort of quickly see

00:44:05.788 --> 00:44:09.085
what types of accessibility issues
you might have on your site.

00:44:09.086 --> 00:44:11.928
It might not catch everything,
but I think it's a pretty decent way

00:44:11.929 --> 00:44:13.936
to catch
at least some of the major issues.

00:44:15.362 --> 00:44:17.359
<v Laura> The next question is from Jen.

00:44:17.780 --> 00:44:21.530
Would it be redundant
to leave the image description

00:44:21.590 --> 00:44:26.851
in the description field and then
to add it to the alt text field?

00:44:27.550 --> 00:44:30.559
<v Cam> That's a good question.
I don't think it matters so much.

00:44:30.829 --> 00:44:33.259
My understanding is
that the issue description field,

00:44:33.799 --> 00:44:37.999
when you go to the media library
on your site is just for the back end

00:44:38.030 --> 00:44:41.988
so that you can have a note
about the image description.

00:44:41.989 --> 00:44:44.059
I don't think it gets presented
to users anywhere.

00:44:45.350 --> 00:44:49.279
It's a little redundant
and it just depends on how you're managing

00:44:49.280 --> 00:44:50.280
that on your site.

00:44:50.464 --> 00:44:53.358
Ultimately, the alternative text field
is the one that's most important

00:44:53.359 --> 00:44:54.424
for accessibility.

00:44:55.933 --> 00:44:59.593
<v Laura> To play on that,
the next question from Philippe,

00:45:00.620 --> 00:45:04.608
and this always comes up too,
is when to use that alt text.

00:45:04.609 --> 00:45:05.900
Our biggest discussion,

00:45:08.300 --> 00:45:13.219
in my understanding, this is
a decorative image as the blind person

00:45:13.220 --> 00:45:18.858
doesn't learn anything from the image,
doesn't need any information from it,

00:45:18.859 --> 00:45:21.033
so you were doing the bean image,

00:45:21.034 --> 00:45:23.614
is that correct?
<v Cam> Yes, yes.

00:45:25.205 --> 00:45:28.023
<v Laura> Is there an overall guideline?

00:45:28.310 --> 00:45:31.243
What are your thoughts
when you're doing a website?

00:45:31.933 --> 00:45:35.239
<v Cam> That one could honestly again be
its own presentation to dive

00:45:35.240 --> 00:45:38.839
into because it depends a lot,
but ultimately it's contextual,

00:45:38.840 --> 00:45:40.606
and some people are going
to have different views.

00:45:40.607 --> 00:45:43.969
The one I shared, I think arguably is
a bit more of a borderline case,

00:45:45.109 --> 00:45:48.469
but in this case,
as a sighted user who's looking

00:45:48.470 --> 00:45:52.158
at a recipe page, I'm definitely going
to want to see a picture of what the food

00:45:52.159 --> 00:45:54.948
looks like, so I think
it's reasonable to try to provide

00:45:54.949 --> 00:46:01.128
that equivalent experience
to non-sighted users.

00:46:01.129 --> 00:46:03.969
In this case, I probably could have done
a better job trying to describe

00:46:04.249 --> 00:46:05.810
what exactly those beans looked like.

00:46:06.440 --> 00:46:08.718
I think if we had
a better example of alt text in that case,

00:46:08.719 --> 00:46:11.049
it might be more clear of,
"Oh, yes, this is helpful."

00:46:12.519 --> 00:46:15.489
<v Laura> You do have people
that have minimal sight

00:46:16.522 --> 00:46:22.518
too, so they appreciate
when they can see parts of an image too.

00:46:22.519 --> 00:46:23.675
<v Cam> Yes.

00:46:23.676 --> 00:46:28.550
<v Laura> I go on the side of caution,
and I at least give something

00:46:28.850 --> 00:46:33.318
to an image
that might be considered decorative,

00:46:33.319 --> 00:46:38.149
unless it's being talked
about in the text too,

00:46:39.200 --> 00:46:41.929
then you're double upping on that.

00:46:42.889 --> 00:46:44.389
The next question is,

00:46:44.749 --> 00:46:48.568
can you talk
about the header hierarchy on a page?

00:46:49.750 --> 00:46:50.960
<v Cam> Yes, yes.

00:46:51.170 --> 00:46:54.049
There are six levels of heading,
headings one through six.

00:46:54.260 --> 00:46:57.079
Heading level one should be
the primary page heading.

00:46:57.680 --> 00:46:59.839
In WordPress, this is usually set up to be

00:47:00.530 --> 00:47:03.319
the name of a page or a post,

00:47:04.219 --> 00:47:07.279
then any headings under
that should be heading level two.

00:47:07.459 --> 00:47:09.169
If you have a subheading under
one of those,

00:47:09.170 --> 00:47:11.960
it should be three,
and so on and so forth.

00:47:12.740 --> 00:47:14.839
It's best to try to go in that order.
Headings

00:47:15.350 --> 00:47:17.600
start with one,
any subheadings under that are two.

00:47:17.960 --> 00:47:20.749
If you have a subheading,
it should be a heading level three,

00:47:20.780 --> 00:47:21.780
and so on.

00:47:23.237 --> 00:47:24.707
<v Laura> All right.
Thank you.

00:47:31.490 --> 00:47:38.411
From Roger, thoughts on using
.focus versus .focus-visible?

00:47:39.290 --> 00:47:40.010
<v Cam> That's a good question.

00:47:40.250 --> 00:47:46.789
The CSS pseudo selector for focus
will show whatever that focus style

00:47:46.790 --> 00:47:50.239
is anytime the element has focus,
which often typically includes

00:47:50.240 --> 00:47:53.467
when a sighted user clicks
on the element for a moment.

00:47:53.468 --> 00:47:57.088
Focus-visible, the CSS pseudo selector
focused as visible,

00:47:58.288 --> 00:48:02.060
your browser is going to try to guess
if you're a keyboard user or a mouse user,

00:48:02.330 --> 00:48:04.357
and so if you're a mouse user
and you click on it,

00:48:04.358 --> 00:48:05.600
it probably won't show.

00:48:07.220 --> 00:48:10.399
I tend to prefer just to use
the focus pseudo selector,

00:48:10.790 --> 00:48:13.220
and I like to design
beautiful focus states

00:48:13.280 --> 00:48:15.099
that are satisfying,

00:48:15.919 --> 00:48:19.629
but you can use focus-visible as well.

00:48:20.209 --> 00:48:21.739
It usually works pretty well.

00:48:21.770 --> 00:48:26.359
It sort of comes down to your design
and the site's vision.

00:48:27.060 --> 00:48:29.959
I think focus is great
because it is going to work for everyone,

00:48:30.019 --> 00:48:34.199
but I've seen the focus-visible one work,
and it can be acceptable as well.

00:48:36.419 --> 00:48:40.469
<v Laura> All right. The next question,
got about two more minutes.

00:48:42.019 --> 00:48:44.449
As awareness of accessibility issues
grows,

00:48:44.450 --> 00:48:48.050
particularly
due to the legal requirements as such,

00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:54.889
websites are indeed becoming more equipped
with built-in features that facilitate

00:48:54.890 --> 00:48:57.230
the creation of accessible sites.

00:48:57.709 --> 00:49:03.078
This trend is especially evident
in the government sector where Civic Plus

00:49:03.079 --> 00:49:05.929
has established itself
as a significant player.

00:49:06.230 --> 00:49:11.929
What do you think will happen, especially
since a lot of websites have to scale back

00:49:11.989 --> 00:49:13.730
on cool-looking sites?

00:49:14.059 --> 00:49:17.553
Do you think it will merge so cool design

00:49:17.554 --> 00:49:21.775
and just basic design
will be both by 2026?

00:49:22.975 --> 00:49:24.865
<v Cam> That is a huge question.

00:49:32.068 --> 00:49:36.019
I hope to see websites that are accessible
and beautiful and cool.

00:49:36.185 --> 00:49:38.448
I've definitely seen sites
that are both, and I don't think there's

00:49:38.449 --> 00:49:41.448
any reason you need to have
a very basic site in order

00:49:41.449 --> 00:49:42.449
to be accessible.

00:49:43.789 --> 00:49:46.008
I do think there's some design
out there that's over the top,

00:49:46.009 --> 00:49:47.869
and I think we might benefit
from a society

00:49:47.870 --> 00:49:50.569
from just more chill websites,

00:49:51.230 --> 00:49:54.200
but I don't think
there's necessarily any contrast

00:49:54.290 --> 00:49:58.908
or fight there between design
and accessibility.

00:50:00.019 --> 00:50:01.347
<v Laura> Yes, definitely.

00:50:01.348 --> 00:50:04.176
Equalize Digital, check out their website.

00:50:04.339 --> 00:50:08.448
They have a cool website that brings
in a lot of different colors and stuff

00:50:08.449 --> 00:50:10.576
like that, but still is accessible.

00:50:10.577 --> 00:50:13.429
That's one of them.

00:50:14.270 --> 00:50:15.349
Next question from Heather.

00:50:15.350 --> 00:50:22.458
Can anyone please share the--
Oh, sorry, anonymous,

00:50:22.459 --> 00:50:27.939
how to work with maps and coordinates
in XML markup and site issues?

00:50:32.559 --> 00:50:36.259
<v Cam> XML markup and maps,
again I feel like that could easily be

00:50:36.260 --> 00:50:38.390
its own hour-long presentation or more.

00:50:42.500 --> 00:50:44.000
Specifically to WordPress,

00:50:44.360 --> 00:50:46.670
I think if you're using
a map on a WordPress,

00:50:47.359 --> 00:50:48.409
you're probably using

00:50:49.069 --> 00:50:52.699
some sort of plugin or you're embedding
something from another site,

00:50:53.179 --> 00:50:54.740
and so in that case,

00:50:54.859 --> 00:50:57.229
I would just want
to do as much testing as possible

00:50:57.230 --> 00:51:02.259
on whatever it is you're bringing in
and make sure that that is accessible,

00:51:02.439 --> 00:51:05.558
and in that case, you're going to have
to work with whatever plugin you're using

00:51:05.559 --> 00:51:08.261
or whatever other site
you're embedding into.

00:51:09.430 --> 00:51:11.773
I think that's the most I can say
on that and this time.

00:51:12.432 --> 00:51:17.079
<v Laura> Thank you, Cam, and thank you
all for attending this session.

00:51:17.409 --> 00:51:21.292
